In a large case-control study of Australian children born during the transition period, those with allergist diagnosed IgE-mediated food allergy were less likely to have received whole-cell vaccine in early infancy than matched population controls (OR: 0.77 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.95)). We hypothesise that a single dose of whole-cell vaccine in early infancy is protective against IgE-mediated food allergy. Methods and analysis This adaptive double-blind randomised controlled trial is investigating whether a mixed whole-cell/aP vaccine schedule prevents allergic disease in the first year of life. The primary outcome is IgE-mediated food allergy by 12 months of age. Secondary outcomes include new onset of atopic dermatitis by 6 or 12 months of age; sensitisation to at least one allergen by 12 months of age; seroconversion in anti-pertussis toxin IgG titres after vaccination with aP booster at 18 months of age; and solicited systemic and local adverse events following immunisation with pertussis-containing vaccines. Analyses will be performed using a Bayesian group sequential design. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Child and Adolescent Health Service Human Research Ethics Committee, Perth, Western Australia (RGS 00019). The investigators will ensure that this trial is conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Individual consent will be requested. Parents will be reimbursed reasonable travel and parking costs to attend the study visits.

DNA methylation and cord blood (CB) vitamin D could represent a plausible link between prenatal PM2.5 exposure and AD in an offspring. Objective: To determine the critical windows of prenatal PM2.5 exposure on the AD phenotypes, if vitamin D modulated these effects, and if placental DNA methylation mediated these effects on AD in offspring. Methods: Mother–child pairs were enrolled from the birth cohort of the Cohort for Childhood Origin of Asthma and allergic diseases (COCOA) study. PM2.5 was estimated by land-use regression models, and CB vitamin D was measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay. AD was identified by the parental report of a physician's diagnosis. We defined the following 4 AD phenotypes according to onset age (by the age of 2 years) and persistence (by the age of 3 years): early-onset transient and persistent, late onset, and never. Logistic regression analysis and Bayesian distributed lag interaction model were used. DNA methylation microarray was analyzed using an Infinium Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, California) in placenta. Results: PM2.5 exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy, especially during 6 to 7 weeks of gestation, was associated with early-onset persistent AD. This effect increased in children with low CB vitamin D, especially in those with PM2.5 exposure during 3 to 7 weeks of gestation. AHRR (cg16371648), DPP10 (cg19211931), and HLADRB1 (cg10632894) were hypomethylated in children with AD with high PM2.5 and low CB vitamin D. Conclusion: Higher PM2.5 during the first trimester of pregnancy and low CB vitamin D affected early-onset persistent AD, and the most sensitive window was 6 to 7 weeks of gestation.

Designing personalized treatment strategies for AD is challenging, given the apparent unpredictability and large variation in AD symptoms and treatment responses within and across individuals. Better prediction of AD severity over time for individual patients could help to select optimum timing and type of treatment for improving disease control. Objective: We aimed to develop a proof of principle mechanistic machine learning model that predicts the patient-specific evolution of AD severity scores on a daily basis. Methods: We designed a probabilistic predictive model and trained it using Bayesian inference with the longitudinal data from two published clinical studies. The data consisted of daily recordings of AD severity scores and treatments used by 59 and 334 AD children over 6 months and 16 weeks, respectively. Validation of the predictive model was conducted in a forward-chaining setting. Results: Our model was able to predict future severity scores at the individual level and improved chance-level forecast by 60%. Heterogeneous patterns in severity trajectories were captured with patient-specific parameters such as the short-term persistence of AD severity and responsiveness to topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors and step-up treatment. Conclusions: Our proof of principle model successfully predicted the daily evolution of AD severity scores at an individual level and could inform the design of personalized treatment strategies that can be tested in future studies. Our model-based approach can be applied to other diseases with apparent unpredictability and large variation in symptoms and treatment responses such as asthma. © 2020 The Authors.

Treatments for AD are based on environmental controls, topical and systemic therapies, and allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT). However, it remains unclear the effectiveness and adverse events of AIT and all conventional topical treatments compared with placebo and each other for AD. Methods: We will search five electronic databases [Central Cochrane register of controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS] from inception until November 2019 with no language restriction, and we will include experimental studies [randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and quasi-RCTs]. The primary outcome is global and specific skin symptoms assessment. Secondary outcomes are hospital length of stay, quality of life, and adverse events. Reviewers independently will extract data from the studies that meet our inclusion criteria and will assess the risk of bias of individual primary studies. We will conduct random effects pairwise meta-analyses for the observed pairwise comparisons with at least two trials. Then, we will perform random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) to obtain treatment effects for all possible comparisons and to provide a hierarchy of all interventions for each outcome. Possible incoherence between direct and indirect sources of evidence will be investigated locally (if possible) and globally. To investigate sources of statistical heterogeneity, we will perform a series of meta-regression analyses based on pre-specified important effect modifiers. Two authors will appraise the certainty of the evidence for each outcome applying the GRADE's framework for NMA. Discussion: The findings of this systematic review will shed the light on the effectiveness and adverse events of all possible comparisons for treating AD and on the quality of the collated evidence for recommendations. It will also provide critical information to health care professionals to comprehend and manage this disease at different age stages, treatment type, duration, and severity of atopic dermatitis.

Objective: To compare the effectiveness and safety of systemic immunomodulatory treatments for patients with atopic dermatitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data Sources: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database, Global Resource of Eczema Trials database, and clinical trial registries were searched from inception to October 28, 2019. Study Selection: English-language randomized clinical trials of 8 weeks or more of treatment with systemic immunomodulatory medications for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were included. Titles, abstracts, and articles were screened in duplicate. Of 10324 citations, 39 trials were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted in duplicate, and the review adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for Network Meta-Analyses guidelines. Random-effects bayesian network meta-analyses were performed and certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prespecified outcomes were change in signs of disease, symptoms, quality of life, itch, withdrawals, and serious adverse events. Results: A total of 39 trials with 6360 patients examining 20 medications and placebo were included. Most trials were conducted for adults receiving up to 16 weeks of therapy. Dupilumab, 300 mg every 2 weeks, was associated with improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index score vs placebo (mean difference, 11.3-point reduction; 95% credible interval [CrI], 9.7-13.1 [high certainty]). Cyclosporine (standardized mean difference, -1.1; 95% CrI, -1.7 to -0.5 [low certainty]) and dupilumab (standardized mean difference, -0.9; 95% CrI, -1.0 to -0.8 [high certainty]) were similarly effective vs placebo in clearing clinical signs of atopic dermatitis and may be superior to methotrexate (standardized mean difference, -0.6; 95% CrI, -1.1 to 0.0 [low certainty]) and azathioprine (standardized mean difference, -0.4; 95% CrI, -0.8 to -0.1 [low certainty]). Several investigational medications for atopic dermatitis are promising, but data to date are limited to small early-phase trials. Safety analyses were limited by low event rates. Conclusions and Relevance: Dupilumab and cyclosporine may be more effective for up to 16 weeks of treatment than methotrexate and azathioprine for treating adult patients with atopic dermatitis. More studies directly comparing established and novel treatments beyond 16 weeks are needed and will be incorporated into future updates of this review. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Material and Methods: We systematically integrated the genetic associations from a recent large-scale periodontitis GWAS and blood expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data using Sherlock, a Bayesian statistical framework. We then validated the potential causal genes in independent gene expression data sets. Gene co-expression analysis was used to explore the functional relationship for the identified causal genes. Results: Sherlock analysis identified 10 genes (rs7403881 for MT1L, rs12459542 for SIGLEC5, rs12459542 for SIGLEC14, rs6680386 for S100A12, rs10489524 for TRIM33, rs11962642 for HIST1H3E, rs2814770 for AIM2, rs7593959 for FASTKD2, rs10416904 for PKN1, and rs10508204 for WDR37) whose expression may influence periodontitis. Among these genes, AIM2 was consistent significantly upregulated in periodontium of periodontitis patients across four data sets. The cis-eQTL (rs2814770, ~16 kb upstream of AIM2) showed significant association with AIM2 (p = 6.63 × 10–6) and suggestive association with periodontitis (p = 7.52 × 10–4). We also validated the significant association between rs2814770 and AIM2 expression in independent expression data set. Pathway analysis revealed that genes co-expressed with AIM2 were significantly enriched in immune- and inflammation-related pathways. Conclusion: Our findings implicate that AIM2 is a susceptibility gene, expression of which in gingiva may influence periodontitis risk. Further functional investigation of AIM2 may provide new insight for periodontitis pathogenesis. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Data regarding the prevalence of diseases from 1999 to 2017 were collected from Patient Survey in Japan. The data were divided according to age groups ranging from 0–4 years old up to 65–69 years old in 5-year increments. A cohort was defined for each age group of each year with a one-year shift, and cohorts born from 1930–1934 up to 2013–2017 were examined. We used Bayesian APC analysis to decompose the changes in prevalence into age, period, and cohort effects. Results show that the period effect for asthma began to increase in 2008, and those of allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis began to increase in 1999. The cohort effects for asthma and atopic dermatitis increased rapidly in cohorts born from approximately 1950 to 1980 and then decreased thereafter. Furthermore, the cohort effect for allergic rhinitis increased from cohorts born in approximately the late 1970s for men and in 1990 for women. The time points with increasing cohort effects for asthma and atopic dermatitis are consistent with the history of air pollution accompanied by rapid economic growth in Japan. The onset of the increased cohort effect for allergic rhinitis was also relatively consistent with the time point at which the mass scattering of pollen began. © 2020 The Korean Society of Environmental Health and Toxicology/Korea Society for Environmental Analysis.","Age–period–cohort analysis; Air pollution; Allergic rhinitis; Asthma; Atopic dermatitis; Prevalence","adolescent; adult; age; aged; air pollution; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child; cohort analysis; economic development; female; human; ICD-10; infant; Japan; major clinical study; male; newborn; population research; prevalence",,,,,,,,"The Patient Survey, , https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&toukei=00450022&tstat=000001031167, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan.

If the relationship of the dose and response is described by a parametric model, a simplistic approach is to scale doses from different schedules to a common unit and pool all rescaled doses. However, this approach ignores the potential heterogeneity in dose–response curves between schedules. A more reasonable approach is the partial pooling, that is, certain parameters of the dose–response curves are shared, while others are allowed to vary. Rather than using schedule-specific fixed-effects, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with random-effects to model the between-schedule heterogeneity with regard to certain parameters. Schedule-specific dose–response relationships can then be estimated using shrinkage estimation. Considering Emax models, the proposed method displayed desirable performance in terms of the mean absolute error and the coverage probabilities for the dose–response curve compared to the complete pooling. Furthermore, it outperformed the partial pooling with schedule-specific fixed-effects by producing lower mean absolute error and shorter credible intervals. The methods are illustrated using simulations and a phase II trial example in atopic dermatitis. A publicly available R package, ModStan, is developed to automate the implementation of the proposed method (https://github.com/gunhanb/ModStan). © 2020 American Statistical Association.","Bayesian inference; Multiple schedules; Phase II trials; Shrinkage estimation",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, H., Patton, T., Jabbar-Lopez, Z., Manca, A., Flohr, C., “Novel Systemic Therapies in Atopic Dermatitis: What Do We Need to Fulfill the Promise of a Treatment Revolution?,” (2019) F1000Research, 8, p. 132; Ballantyne, C., Neutel, J., Cropp, A., Duggan, W., Wang, E., Plowchalk, D., Sweeney, K., Bays, H., “Efficacy and Safety of Bococizumab (RN316/PF-04950615), a Monoclonal Antibody Against Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 in Statin-Treated Hypercholesterolemic Subjects: Results From a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Ranging Study (2014) Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 63, p.

Tripterygium agents (TA), extracted from Tripterygium wilfordii hook F, a traditional Chinese medicine, have been used as a supplemental therapy for treating eczema empirically in recent years. Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and safety of TA for treating atopic eczema. Study design: Systematic review and Bayesian analysis. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CNKI, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, the Wan Fang Database, and Chinese Biomedicine databases were systematically searched from their respective inception dates to October 2, 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to TA used alone or in combination with other drugs were included. Meta-analysis was conducted by RevMan 5.3 software, and Bayesian analysis was performed in Stata 15.0 and R (V.3.4.0) package gemtc software. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and Jadad score were applied to assess the quality of all trials. Results: Thirteen trials involving 1385 patients were analyzed. Meta-analysis showed that, when treating atopic eczema patients, TA combined with other drugs were strongly synergistic (p < 0.00001). Among all combinations, the efficacy of TA combined with Diyin tablet (DYP) and topical glucocorticoids (TG) (RR: 0.06, 95%CI [0.01, 0.53]), as well as with compound glycyrrhizin (CG) (RR: 0.36, 95%CI [0.14,0.94]) was superior. Among the different combined medications, the best curative effect was achieved with TA combined with DYP and TG (98.2%), followed by TA combined with CG (85.3%), with TG (51.0%), or with Fuyang granule (FG) (49.9%). Reproductive system dysfunction was the main adverse events in patients treated with TA (RR: 6.23, 95%CI [1.12, 34.62]). Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were significantly decreased, after treatment with TA (p = 0.04). Subgroup analysis indicated no statistically significant difference in eczema-related cytokines (p = 0.44). Recurrence rates of using TA and other drugs were similar (p = 0.40). Conclusion: TA appear to be effective in some therapies when treating patients with atopic eczema, but with apparent side effects. It cannot be concluded that TA can be generally used for eczema in the clinic, because of the small sample size. Further multi-center studies with large samples, and high-quality RCTs should be conducted to clarify the efficacy and safety of TA for treating eczema. © 2019","Atopic eczematopic Eczema; Bayesian analysis; Systematic review; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Tripterygium","cytokine; Diyin tablet; Fuyang granule; glucocorticoid; glycyrrhizic acid; herbaceous agent; immunoglobulin E; Tripterygium wilfordii extract; unclassified drug; dermatological agent; plant extract; atopic dermatitis; Bayes theorem; dizziness; drowsiness; drug efficacy; drug safety; gastrointestinal symptom; genital system disease; human; hypertriglyceridemia; leukopenia; meta analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrence risk; Review; side effect; systematic review; therapy effect; Tripterygium wilfordii; atopic dermatitis; chemistry; phytotherapy; Tripterygium; Bayes Theorem; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dermatologic Agents; Humans; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Tripterygium",,"glycyrrhizic acid, 1405-86-3; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Dermatologic Agents; Plant Extracts",,,"2017047

Various inflammatory conditions have been linked to cardiovascular disease, a major cause of global mortality and morbidity. Objective: We sought to systematically review and meta-analyze population-based studies assessing associations between atopic eczema and specific cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health were searched from inception to December 2017. We obtained pooled estimates using random-effects meta-analyses. We used a multivariate Bayesian meta-regression model to estimate the slope of effect of increasing atopic eczema severity on cardiovascular outcomes. Results: Nineteen relevant studies were included. The effects of atopic eczema reported in cross-sectional studies were heterogeneous, with no evidence for pooled associations with angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke. In cohort studies atopic eczema was associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction (n = 4; relative risk [RR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00-1.25), stroke (n = 4; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), ischemic stroke n = 4; RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.14-1.20), angina (n = 2; RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.24), and heart failure (n = 2; RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.51). Prediction intervals were wide for myocardial infarction and stroke. The risk of cardiovascular outcomes appeared to increase with increasing severity (mean RR increase between severity categories, 1.15; 95% credibility interval, 1.09-1.21; uncertainty interval, 1.04-1.28). Conclusion: Significant associations with cardiovascular outcomes were more common in cohort studies but with considerable between-study heterogeneity. Increasing atopic eczema severity was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Improved awareness among stakeholders regarding this small but significant association is warranted. © 2018 The Authors","angina; atopic dermatitis; Atopic eczema; cardiovascular death; cardiovascular outcomes; heart failure; ischemic stroke; myocardial infarction; risk factors; stroke","angina pectoris; Article; atopic dermatitis; Bayesian learning; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; data extraction; disease association; disease severity; heart failure; heart infarction; human; meta analysis; multivariate analysis; population health; predictive value; priority journal; quality control; systematic review; atopic dermatitis; Bayes theorem; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; population group; Bayes Theorem; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Population Groups",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

In order to understand the relative efficacy and safety of existing and new treatments for atopic dermatitis, robust mixed comparisons (ie, direct and indirect) would be beneficial. To address this gap, this protocol describes methods for a systematic review and network meta-analysis of systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis. Methods and analysis We will update the search of a previous systematic review, including searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database and the Global Resource of EczemA Trials database in addition to clinical trial protocol registries. Title, abstract and full paper screening as well as data extraction will be conducted in duplicate by independent researchers. Primary outcomes include efficacy with regards to clinician-reported signs and patient-reported symptoms and safety with regards to withdrawal from treatment due to adverse events and the occurrence of serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will include change in quality of life and itch severity. Where possible and appropriate, network meta-analysis will be performed for each outcome using a random-effects model within a Bayesian framework. If appropriate, the review will be transitioned to a living review with continuous updating of the analysis. Ethics and dissemination Dissemination in a peer-reviewed scientific journal is planned.

However, the symptoms indicating this medicine have not yet been assessed systematically. Likelihood ratio (LR), based on Bayesian statistics, may yield better estimation of a medicine's indication than the existing method of entry of symptoms into materia medica and repertories. Methods We investigated LRs of four CD symptoms of VM: (1) great sensitiveness of skin, with redness and soreness from slightest rubbing; (2) weeping eczema with foul, thick crusts; (3) itching amelioration in open air; and (4) CD of scalp. An observational, prospective, patient-outcome study was conducted in five different practice settings on 390 CD patients over 18 months using three outcomes-Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital Outcome Scale (GHHOS), Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months. The LR of each of the four symptoms was estimated as per the patient-rated outcomes on GHHOS. Results Seventy-four VM and 316 non-VM cases were analyzed. Estimated LRs were as follows: symptom 1, 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65 to 2.60); symptom 2, 1.48 (95% CI: 0.80 to 2.74); symptom 3, 1.70 (95% CI: 0.94 to 3.07); symptom 4, 1.36 (95% CI: 0.74 to 2.51). There were statistically significant reductions in SCORAD and DLQI scores over 3 and 6 months. Conclusion There was insufficient evidence to attribute any of the four assessed symptoms clearly to VM. Though non-significant, a high LR was observed for itching amelioration in open air (symptom 3). Symptoms in the homeopathic materia medica for VM are perhaps over-represented. More research of this nature is warranted. © 2018 The Faculty of Homeopathy.","contact dermatitis; homeopathy; likelihood ratio; Vinca minor","homeopathic agent; materia medica; placebo; adult; Article; contact dermatitis; Dermatology Life Quality Index; eczema; female; Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital Outcome Scale; homeopathy; human; India; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; observational study; patient-reported outcome; prospective study; Scoring Atopic Dermatitis; skin disease assessment; skin pruritus; skin redness; Vinca; Vinca minor; atopic dermatitis; follow up; homeopathy; procedures; treatment outcome; Adult; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Homeopathy; Humans; Male; Materia Medica; Placebos; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Vinca",,"Materia Medica; Placebos",,,,,,"Sasseville, D., Occupational contact dermatitis (2008) Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol, 4, pp. 209-2017; Ale, I.S., Maibach, H.I., Irritant contact dermatitis (2014) Rev Environ Health, 29, pp. 195-206; Lachapelle, J.M., Allergic contact dermatitis: Clinical aspects (2014) Rev Environ Health, 29, pp. 185-194; Alchorne, A.O., Alchorne, M.M., Silva, M.M., Occupational dermatosis (2010) An Bras Dermatol, 85, pp. 137-145; Sarma, N., Occupational allergic contact dermatitis among construction workers in India (2009) Indian J Dermatol, 54, pp. 137-141; Anderson, S.E., Meade, B.J., Potential health effects associated with dermal exposure to occupational chemicals (2014) Environ Health Insights, 8, pp. 51-62; Cohen, D.E., Heidary, N., Treatment of irritant and allergic contact dermatitis (2004) Dermatol Ther (Heidelb), 17, pp. 334-340; Holness, D.L., Occupational skin allergies: Testing and treatment (the case of occupational allergic contact dermatitis) (2014) Curr Allergy Asthma Rep, 14, p. 410; Jacobsson, I., Jönsson, A.K., Gerdén, B., Hägg, S., Spontaneously reported adverse reactions in association with complementary and alternative medicine substances in Sweden (2009) Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf, 18, pp. 1039-1047; Noiesen, E., Munk, M.D., Larsen, K., Hoyen, M., Agner, T., Use of complementary and alternative treatment for allergic contact dermatitis (2007) Br J Dermatol, 157, pp. 301-305; Bascom, A., Complementary and alternative therapies in occupational health.

The 5q22.1 region was found to have an association with AD in our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS). Objective To identify the AD susceptibility gene in 5q22.1 and observe its expression in AD tissues. Methods Suggestive indels from the GWAS data were genotyped in 3013 AD patients and 5075 controls from the Chinese Han population with the SequenomMassArray system. Association, Bayesian and bioinformatics analyses were used to identify possible causal indels and genes in the 5q22.1 region. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to observe protein expression in the tissues. PLINK 1.07 software was used for all statistical analyses. Results The genotyping and association analysis showed that six deletions and four SNPs were associated with AD (P &lt; 0.005). The rs11357450 (Pcombined = 7.79E-04, OR = 1.39, logBayes Factor = 1.29) deletion located in TMEM232 was identified to be the strongest variant. Analysis of the genetic model revealed that the dominant model best described rs11357450 (P = 1.96E-03, OR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.07–1.37). IHC showed that the expression of TMEM232 decreased gradually from the granular layer to the basal layer in AD, but in normal tissues, this trend was reversed. Additionally, positive cytoplasm staining was found in lymphocytes around the blood vessels in AD. Conclusions The study indicates that TMEM232 in the 5q22.1 region is the causal gene for AD in the Chinese Han population. © 2017 The Authors","Atopic dermatitis; Deletion; Expression; TMEM232","membrane protein; transmembrane protein 232; unclassified drug; membrane protein; TMEM232 protein, human; adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; basement membrane; Bayes theorem; bioinformatics; blood vessel; Chinese; chromosome 5q; chromosome 5q22.1; controlled study; cytoplasm; female; genetic association; genetic model; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genotype; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; indel mutation; lymphocyte; major clinical study; male; priority journal; protein expression; single nucleotide polymorphism; software; atopic dermatitis; case control study; child; China; chromosome 5; genetics; infant; metabolism; preschool child; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; INDEL Mutation; Infant; Male; Membrane Proteins; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,"Membrane Proteins; TMEM232 protein, human",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 81071284, 81172838, 81301353

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 includes estimates of global morbidity and mortality due to skin diseases. OBJECTIVE To measure the burden of skin diseases worldwide. DATA SOURCES For nonfatal estimates, data were found by literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar in English and Spanish for years 1980 through 2013 and by accessing administrative data on hospital inpatient and outpatient episodes. Data for fatal estimates were based on vital registration and verbal autopsy data. STUDY SELECTION Skin disease data were extracted from more than 4000 sources including systematic reviews, surveys, population-based disease registries, hospital inpatient data, outpatient data, cohort studies, and autopsy data. Data metrics included incidence, prevalence, remission, duration, severity, deaths, and mortality risk. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Datawere extracted by age, time period, case definitions, and other study characteristics. Data points were modeled with Bayesian meta-regression to generate estimates of morbidity and mortalitymetrics for skin diseases. All estimates were made with 95%uncertainty intervals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lived with disability, and years of life lost from 15 skin conditions in 188 countries. RESULTS Skin conditions contributed 1.79% to the global burden of disease measured in DALYs from 306 diseases and injuries in 2013. Individual skin diseases varied in size from 0.38%of total burden for dermatitis (atopic, contact, and seborrheic dermatitis), 0.29% for acne vulgaris, 0.19% for psoriasis, 0.19% for urticaria, 0.16%for viral skin diseases, 0.15%for fungal skin diseases, 0.07%for scabies, 0.06%for malignant skin melanoma, 0.05%for pyoderma, 0.04%for cellulitis, 0.03%for keratinocyte carcinoma, 0.03%for decubitus ulcer, and 0.01% for alopecia areata. All other skin and subcutaneous diseases composed 0.12%of total DALYs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Skin and subcutaneous diseases were the 18th leading cause of global DALYs in Global Burden of Disease 2013. Excluding mortality, skin diseases were the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide. Copyright 2017 American Medical Association.

The vast majority of studies in the literature are based on classic statistical methods; however, developments in computational techniques such as soft computing-based approaches hold new promise in this field. Objective: The aim of this manuscript is to systematically review the main soft computing-based techniques such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, bayesian networks and fuzzy logic to investigate their performances in the field of allergic diseases. Methods: The review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and the protocol was registered within PROSPERO database (CRD42016038894). The research was performed on PubMed and ScienceDirect, covering the period starting from September 1, 1990 through April 19, 2016. Results: The review included 27 studies related to allergic diseases and soft computing performances. We observed promising results with an overall accuracy of 86.5%, mainly focused on asthmatic disease. The review reveals that soft computing-based approaches are suitable for big data analysis and can be very powerful, especially when dealing with uncertainty and poorly characterized parameters. Furthermore, they can provide valuable support in case of lack of data and entangled cause-effect relationships, which make it difficult to assess the evolution of disease. Conclusions: Although most works deal with asthma, we believe the soft computing approach could be a real breakthrough and foster new insights into other allergic diseases as well. © 2017 The Author(s).","Allergy; Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural networks; Asthma; Fuzzy logic","carboplatin; complement component C1s inhibitor; dexamethasone; docetaxel; oxaliplatin; paclitaxel; allergic asthma; allergic conjunctivitis; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; Article; artificial neural network; atopic dermatitis; Bayesian learning; fuzzy logic; human; hypersensitivity; support vector machine; systematic review; thrombosis",,"carboplatin, 41575-94-4; complement component C1s inhibitor, 80295-37-0, 80295-38-1; dexamethasone, 50-02-2; docetaxel, 114977-28-5; oxaliplatin, 61825-94-3; paclitaxel, 33069-62-4",,,,,,"Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy logic, neural networks, and soft computing (1994) Commun ACM, 37, pp. 77-84; Michie, D., Spiegelhalter, D.J., Taylor, C.C., Machine learning, neural and statistical classification (1994), Ellis Horwood Limited; Rosenblatt, F., Principles of neurodynamics (1961) Perceptrons and the theory of brain mechanisms, , Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, Report no.

Our aim was to evaluate whether in Sweden the incidence of CAD varies spatially, and to investigate possible environmental causes of such variation in a longitudinal study of CAD incidence among insured Swedish dogs. The dataset consisted of >220,000 individuals which had been covered by an insurance plan between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2002. Out of these, 1235 CAD cases were identified and matched to postal-code areas based upon the address of the owner. Environmental risk factors we considered included averages of long-term annual rainfall, and of January and July temperatures. Initial visualization of the incidence rate of CAD (cases/dog-years at risk) expressed as empirical Bayes smoothed spatial rates indicated geographic variation. Moran's I, adjusted for population at risk, revealed significant global clustering. Both the spatial scan statistic and a local indicator of spatial autocorrelation revealed a higher incidence of CAD in the major cities. In a Poisson-regression model (with a spatial covariance structure), the incidence of CAD increased with increasing human population density, increasing average annual rainfall, living in the southern half of Sweden, and having a veterinary dermatologist in the county. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To compare two recently proposed Bayesian methods for quantitative pharmacovigilance with respect to assumptions and results, and to describe some practical strategies for their use. Methods. The two methods were expressed in common terms to simplify identifying similarities and differences, some extensions to both methods were provided, and the empirical Bayes method was applied to accumulated experience on a new antihypertensive drug to elucidate the pattern of adverse-event reporting. Both methods use the logarithm of the proportional risk ratio as the basic metric for association. Results. The two methods provide similar numerical results for frequently reported events, but not necessarily when few events are reported. Using a lower 5% quantile of the posterior distribution gives some assurance that potential signals are unlikely to be noise. The calculations indicated that most potential adverse event-drug associations that were well-recognized after 6 years of use could be identified within the first year, that most of the associations identified in the first year persisted over time. Other insights into the pattern of event reporting were also noted. Conclusion. Both methods can provide useful early signals of potential drug-event associations that subsequently can be the focus of detailed evaluation by skilled clinicians and epidemiologists.
