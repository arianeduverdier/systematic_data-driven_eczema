Method: Meat inspectors at four processing plants located in the Northland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Taranaki regions of New Zealand graded all dairy cattle livers on particular days in April and May of 2018 and 2019 using a gross liver pathology score (GLS) from 0–5 (0 = no damage, 1= fatty liver, 2 = cholangitis and early cirrhosis, 3 = cirrhosis, 4 = extensive cirrhosis, 5 = regeneration). Forty livers from each grade were selected for histopathology. Sections from the apical margin of the right and the left lobes were scored using a histology biliary score (HBS; scored from 1–16) based on the classical histological lesions of FE focussing on changes that differentiate FE from fasciolosis. Mean HBS was collapsed into scores 2–6 (no and mild damage) and score 7–12 (moderate and severe) and GLS was collapsed into grades 0–2 (no or mild damage) and grades 3–5 (moderate, severe and chronic damage). A Bayesian latent class model was developed to estimate sensitivity and specificity of HBS and GLS. The diagnostic target was moderate or severe, gross and/or histological changes in the liver consistent with FE. Results: A total of 2,899 dairy cow livers were graded at the four plants over the two study periods. There were 700/2,899 (24.1%) livers with at least some form of gross pathology damage (GLS≥1) and 130/2,899 (4.5%) livers with moderate, severe or chronic gross pathology damage (GLS≥3). The estimates (posterior median) for the sensitivity and specificity of GLS to liver damage were 0.844 (95% credible interval (CrI) = 0.757–0.905) and 0.932 (95% CrI = 0.866–0.973) respectively. Estimates for HBS were 0.834 (95% CrI = 0.765–0.892) and 0.778 (95% CrI = 0.707–0.854), respectively. Conclusion and clinical relevance: GLS is a useful means of estimating liver damage consistent with FE at slaughter. Increased use of liver scoring at slaughter could be useful for monitoring the likely impacts of FE at the country and regional levels. © 2020 New Zealand Veterinary Association.","Facial eczema; gross pathology; histology; liver damage; processing plants","animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autumn; cholangitis; dairy cattle; eczema; face; fascioliasis; fatty liver; fibrosis; gross liver pathology score; histology; histology biliary score; histopathology; hyperplasia; inflammation; inspector; latent class analysis; liver cirrhosis; liver injury; mononuclear peribiliary inflammation; New Zealand; nonhuman; periportal eosinophilic inflammation; periportal lymphatic ectasia; portal vessel thickening; prevalence; regeneration; sensitivity and specificity",,,,,"Massey University

We have studied three supervised learning methods for segmentation of lesions: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayesian Classifier (NBC) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Two sets of images that are different in erythema severity levels (mild, moderate) are used for training the supervised classifiers. From the training images 108 features are extracted that are ranked using four feature ranking methods (standard deviation, T-statistical score, fisher scoring, and correlation coefficient) to obtain the most significant features. The performance of classification is investigated using green channel of RGB and CSN-I RGB color space. The performance of the different methods is assessed by comparing the segmented lesions with the gold standard segmented images. Based on these comparisons, it is observed that SVM classifier shows the best segmentation result having an accuracy of 84.43% whereas the accuracy of NBC and KNN is 82.77% and 83.53% respectively. © 2020 IEEE.","classification; color models; Eczema lesions; segmentation; supervised learning","Dermatology; Nearest neighbor search; Sodium compounds; Support vector machines; Automatic segmentations; Bayesian classifier; Correlation coefficient; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Segmentation results; Standard deviation; Supervised classifiers; Supervised learning methods; Learning systems",,,,,,,,"Finlay, A.Y., Measurement of disease activity and outcome in atopic dermatitis (1996) Br J Dermatol, 135 (4), pp. 509-515; Williams, H., Robertson, C., Stewart, A., Worldwide variations in the prevalence of symptoms of atopic eczema in the international study of asthama and allergies in childhood (1999) J.

Designing personalized treatment strategies for AD is challenging, given the apparent unpredictability and large variation in AD symptoms and treatment responses within and across individuals. Better prediction of AD severity over time for individual patients could help to select optimum timing and type of treatment for improving disease control. Objective: We aimed to develop a proof of principle mechanistic machine learning model that predicts the patient-specific evolution of AD severity scores on a daily basis. Methods: We designed a probabilistic predictive model and trained it using Bayesian inference with the longitudinal data from two published clinical studies. The data consisted of daily recordings of AD severity scores and treatments used by 59 and 334 AD children over 6 months and 16 weeks, respectively. Validation of the predictive model was conducted in a forward-chaining setting. Results: Our model was able to predict future severity scores at the individual level and improved chance-level forecast by 60%. Heterogeneous patterns in severity trajectories were captured with patient-specific parameters such as the short-term persistence of AD severity and responsiveness to topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors and step-up treatment. Conclusions: Our proof of principle model successfully predicted the daily evolution of AD severity scores at an individual level and could inform the design of personalized treatment strategies that can be tested in future studies. Our model-based approach can be applied to other diseases with apparent unpredictability and large variation in symptoms and treatment responses such as asthma. © 2020 The Authors.

Epitope-specific IgE levels have been correlated with the severity of egg allergy, while emerging evidence suggests that other antibody isotypes (IgG1, IgG4, IgA, and IgD) may have a protective function; yet, their epitope-specific repertoires and associations with atopic comorbidities have not been studied. Methods: Bead-based epitope assay (BBEA) was used to quantitate the levels of epitope-specific (es)IgA, esIgE, esIgD, esIgG1, and esIgG4 antibodies directed at 58 (15-mer) overlapping peptides, covering the entire sequence of ovomucoid, in plasma of 38 egg-allergic and 6 atopic children. Intraclass correlation (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) were used for the reliability assessment. The relationships across esIgs were evaluated using network analysis; linear and logistic regressions were used to compare groups based on egg allergy status and comorbidities. Results: BBEA had high reliability (ICC &gt;0.75) and low variability (CV &lt;20%) and could detect known IgE-binding epitopes. Egg-allergic children had lower esIgA1 (P =.010) and esIgG1 (P =.016) and higher esIgE (P &lt;.001) and esIgD (P =.015) levels compared to the atopic controls. Interestingly, within the allergic group, children with higher esIgD had decreased odds of anaphylactic reactions (OR =0.48, P =.038). Network analysis identified most associations between esIgE with either esIgG4 or esIgD; indicating that IgE-secreting plasma cells could originate from either sequential isotype switch from antigen-experienced intermediate isotypes or directly from the IgD+ B cells. Conclusions: Collectively, these data point toward a contribution of epitope-specific antibody repertoires to the pathogenesis of egg allergy. © 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Objective: To compare the effectiveness and safety of systemic immunomodulatory treatments for patients with atopic dermatitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data Sources: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database, Global Resource of Eczema Trials database, and clinical trial registries were searched from inception to October 28, 2019. Study Selection: English-language randomized clinical trials of 8 weeks or more of treatment with systemic immunomodulatory medications for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were included. Titles, abstracts, and articles were screened in duplicate. Of 10324 citations, 39 trials were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted in duplicate, and the review adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for Network Meta-Analyses guidelines. Random-effects bayesian network meta-analyses were performed and certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prespecified outcomes were change in signs of disease, symptoms, quality of life, itch, withdrawals, and serious adverse events. Results: A total of 39 trials with 6360 patients examining 20 medications and placebo were included. Most trials were conducted for adults receiving up to 16 weeks of therapy. Dupilumab, 300 mg every 2 weeks, was associated with improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index score vs placebo (mean difference, 11.3-point reduction; 95% credible interval [CrI], 9.7-13.1 [high certainty]). Cyclosporine (standardized mean difference, -1.1; 95% CrI, -1.7 to -0.5 [low certainty]) and dupilumab (standardized mean difference, -0.9; 95% CrI, -1.0 to -0.8 [high certainty]) were similarly effective vs placebo in clearing clinical signs of atopic dermatitis and may be superior to methotrexate (standardized mean difference, -0.6; 95% CrI, -1.1 to 0.0 [low certainty]) and azathioprine (standardized mean difference, -0.4; 95% CrI, -0.8 to -0.1 [low certainty]). Several investigational medications for atopic dermatitis are promising, but data to date are limited to small early-phase trials. Safety analyses were limited by low event rates. Conclusions and Relevance: Dupilumab and cyclosporine may be more effective for up to 16 weeks of treatment than methotrexate and azathioprine for treating adult patients with atopic dermatitis. More studies directly comparing established and novel treatments beyond 16 weeks are needed and will be incorporated into future updates of this review. © 2020 American Medical Association.

They are complex, multifactorial, and are caused by a variety of different mechanisms, which result in multiple heterogeneous clinical phenotypes. Atopic march is usually interpreted as the sequential development of symptoms from eczema in infancy, to asthma, and then allergic rhinitis. Areas covered: The authors reviewed the evidence on the multimorbidity of eczema, asthma, and rhinitis, and the implication of results of data-driven analyses on the concept framework of atopic march. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles published until July 2020. Application of Bayesian machine learning framework to rich phenotypic data from birth cohorts demonstrated that the postulated linear progression of symptoms (atopic march) does not capture the heterogeneity of allergic phenotypes. Expert opinion: Eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis co-exist more often than would be expected by chance, but their relationship can be best understood in a multimorbidity framework, rather than through atopic march sequence. The observation of their co-occurrence does not imply any specific relationship between them, and certainly not a progressive or causal one. It is unlikely that a sngle mechanism such as allergic sensitization underpins different multimorbidity manifestations. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","allergic rhinitis; allergic sensitization; asthma; atopic march; eczema; machine learning; personalized medicine",,,,,,,"This paper was not funded.",,"Johansson, S.G., Bieber, T., Dahl, R., Revised nomenclature for allergy for global use: Report of the Nomenclature Review Committee of the World Allergy Organization, October 2003 (2004) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 113, pp. 832-836; Oksel, C., Custovic, A., Development of allergic sensitization and its relevance to paediatric asthma (2018) Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol, 18, pp. 109-116; Dharmage, S.C., Perret, J.L., Custovic, A., Epidemiology of Asthma in Children and Adults (2019) Front Pediatr, 7, p. 246; Custovic, A., Henderson, J., Simpson, A., Does understanding endotypes translate to better asthma management options for all?

In order to uncover communalities between heterogeneous data, the data are often harmonized by constructing a kernel and perform numerical integration. In this study, we propose a method for data integration in the framework of an undirected graphical model, where the nodes represent individual data sources of varying nature in terms of complexity and underlying distribution and where the edges represent the partial correlations between two blocks of data. We propose a modified GLASSO for estimation of the graph, with a combination of cross-validation and extended Bayes Information Criterion for sparsity tuning. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering on the weighted consensus kernels from a fixed network is used to partitioning the samples into different classes. Simulations show increasing ability to uncover true edges with increasing sample size and signal to noise. Likewise, identification of nonexisting edges towards disconnected nodes is feasible. The framework is demonstrated for integration of longitudinal symptom burden data, from the second and third year of life, combined with 21 diseases precursors and information of the development of asthma and eczema at the age of 6 years, from 403 children from the COPSAC2010 mother-child cohort. This suggests that maternal predisposition as well as being born preterm indirectly lead to a higher risk of asthma via an increased respiratory symptom burden. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","dual-primal optimization; GLASSO; heterogeneous data integration; kernelization; undirected graphical models",,,,,,,,,"Aben, N., Westerhuis, J.A., Song, Y., Kiers, H.A., Michaut, M., Smilde, A.K., Wessels, L.F.A., iTOP: inferring the topology of omics data (2018) Bioinformatics, 34 (17), pp. i988-i996; Shawe-Taylor, J., Cristianini, N., (2004) Kernel Methods for Pattern Analysis, , Cambridge, Cambridge university press; Camps-Valls, G., Gómez-Chova, L., Muñoz-Marí, J., Rojo-Álvarez, J.L., Martínez-Ramón, M., Kernel-based framework for multitemporal and multisource remote sensing data classification and change detection (2008) IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens, 46 (6), pp. 1822-1835; Carroll, J.D., Chang, J.-J., Analysis of individual differences in multidimensional scaling via an n-way generalization of eckart-young decomposition (1970) Psychometrika, 35 (3), pp. 283-319; Robert, P., Escoufier, Y., A unifying tool for linear multivariate statistical methods: the rv-coefficient (1976) J R Stat Soc: Ser C (Appl Stat), 25 (3), pp. 257-265; Smilde, A.K., Kiers, H.A., Bijlsma, S., Rubingh, C.M., Van Erk, M., Matrix correlations for high-dimensional data: the modified rv-coefficient (2008) Bioinformatics, 25 (3), pp. 401-405; Foygel, R., Drton, M., (2010) Extended Bayesian information criteria for gaussian graphical models, pp. 604-612. , In Advances in neural information processing systems; de Rooi, J., Nørgaard, S.K., Rasmussen, M.A., Bønnelykke, K., Bisgaard, H., Smilde, A.K., Data representations and-analyses of binary diary data in pursuit of stratifying children based on common childhood illnesses (2018) PloS one, 13 (11); Bisgaard, H., Vissing, N.H., Carson, C.G., Deep phenotyping of the unselected COPSAC 2010 birth cohort study (2013) Clin Exp Allergy, 43 (12), pp. 1384-1394; Friedman, J., Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., Sparse inverse covariance estimation with the graphical lasso (2008) Biostatistics, 9 (3), pp. 432-441; Mazumder, R., Hastie, T., The graphical lasso: new insights and alternatives (2012) Electron J Stat, 6, p. 2125; Su, W., Bogdan, M., Candes, E., False discoveries occur early on the lasso path (2017) Ann Stat, 45 (5), pp. 2133-2150; Revai, K., Mamidi, D., Chonmaitree, T., Association of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization during upper respiratory tract infection and the development of acute otitis media (2008) Clin Infect Dis, 46 (4), pp. e34-e37; Sevelsted, A., Stokholm, J., Bønnelykke, K., Bisgaard, H., Cesarean section and chronic immune disorders (2015) Pediatrics, 135 (1), pp. e92-e98; Lux, A.L., Henderson, A.J., Pocock, S.J., Wheeze associated with prenatal tobacco smoke exposure: a prospective, longitudinal study (2000) Arch Dis Child, 83 (4), pp. 307-312; Lim, R.H., Kobzik, L., Dahl, M., Risk for asthma in offspring of asthmatic mothers versus fathers: A meta-analysis (2010) PloS one, 5 (4); Litonjua, A.A., Carey, V.J., Burge, H.A., Weiss, S.T., Gold, D.R., Parental history and the risk for childhood asthma: does mother confer more risk than father?

Tripterygium agents (TA), extracted from Tripterygium wilfordii hook F, a traditional Chinese medicine, have been used as a supplemental therapy for treating eczema empirically in recent years. Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and safety of TA for treating atopic eczema. Study design: Systematic review and Bayesian analysis. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CNKI, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, the Wan Fang Database, and Chinese Biomedicine databases were systematically searched from their respective inception dates to October 2, 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to TA used alone or in combination with other drugs were included. Meta-analysis was conducted by RevMan 5.3 software, and Bayesian analysis was performed in Stata 15.0 and R (V.3.4.0) package gemtc software. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and Jadad score were applied to assess the quality of all trials. Results: Thirteen trials involving 1385 patients were analyzed. Meta-analysis showed that, when treating atopic eczema patients, TA combined with other drugs were strongly synergistic (p < 0.00001). Among all combinations, the efficacy of TA combined with Diyin tablet (DYP) and topical glucocorticoids (TG) (RR: 0.06, 95%CI [0.01, 0.53]), as well as with compound glycyrrhizin (CG) (RR: 0.36, 95%CI [0.14,0.94]) was superior. Among the different combined medications, the best curative effect was achieved with TA combined with DYP and TG (98.2%), followed by TA combined with CG (85.3%), with TG (51.0%), or with Fuyang granule (FG) (49.9%). Reproductive system dysfunction was the main adverse events in patients treated with TA (RR: 6.23, 95%CI [1.12, 34.62]). Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were significantly decreased, after treatment with TA (p = 0.04). Subgroup analysis indicated no statistically significant difference in eczema-related cytokines (p = 0.44). Recurrence rates of using TA and other drugs were similar (p = 0.40). Conclusion: TA appear to be effective in some therapies when treating patients with atopic eczema, but with apparent side effects. It cannot be concluded that TA can be generally used for eczema in the clinic, because of the small sample size. Further multi-center studies with large samples, and high-quality RCTs should be conducted to clarify the efficacy and safety of TA for treating eczema. © 2019","Atopic eczematopic Eczema; Bayesian analysis; Systematic review; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Tripterygium","cytokine; Diyin tablet; Fuyang granule; glucocorticoid; glycyrrhizic acid; herbaceous agent; immunoglobulin E; Tripterygium wilfordii extract; unclassified drug; dermatological agent; plant extract; atopic dermatitis; Bayes theorem; dizziness; drowsiness; drug efficacy; drug safety; gastrointestinal symptom; genital system disease; human; hypertriglyceridemia; leukopenia; meta analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrence risk; Review; side effect; systematic review; therapy effect; Tripterygium wilfordii; atopic dermatitis; chemistry; phytotherapy; Tripterygium; Bayes Theorem; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dermatologic Agents; Humans; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Tripterygium",,"glycyrrhizic acid, 1405-86-3; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Dermatologic Agents; Plant Extracts",,,"2017047

Various inflammatory conditions have been linked to cardiovascular disease, a major cause of global mortality and morbidity. Objective: We sought to systematically review and meta-analyze population-based studies assessing associations between atopic eczema and specific cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health were searched from inception to December 2017. We obtained pooled estimates using random-effects meta-analyses. We used a multivariate Bayesian meta-regression model to estimate the slope of effect of increasing atopic eczema severity on cardiovascular outcomes. Results: Nineteen relevant studies were included. The effects of atopic eczema reported in cross-sectional studies were heterogeneous, with no evidence for pooled associations with angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke. In cohort studies atopic eczema was associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction (n = 4; relative risk [RR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00-1.25), stroke (n = 4; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), ischemic stroke n = 4; RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.14-1.20), angina (n = 2; RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.24), and heart failure (n = 2; RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.51). Prediction intervals were wide for myocardial infarction and stroke. The risk of cardiovascular outcomes appeared to increase with increasing severity (mean RR increase between severity categories, 1.15; 95% credibility interval, 1.09-1.21; uncertainty interval, 1.04-1.28). Conclusion: Significant associations with cardiovascular outcomes were more common in cohort studies but with considerable between-study heterogeneity. Increasing atopic eczema severity was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Improved awareness among stakeholders regarding this small but significant association is warranted. © 2018 The Authors","angina; atopic dermatitis; Atopic eczema; cardiovascular death; cardiovascular outcomes; heart failure; ischemic stroke; myocardial infarction; risk factors; stroke","angina pectoris; Article; atopic dermatitis; Bayesian learning; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; data extraction; disease association; disease severity; heart failure; heart infarction; human; meta analysis; multivariate analysis; population health; predictive value; priority journal; quality control; systematic review; atopic dermatitis; Bayes theorem; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; population group; Bayes Theorem; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Population Groups",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

In utero exposure to chemicals used in personal care products and plastics may contribute to increase in these diseases. Methods: We quantified urinary concentrations of eight phthalate metabolites and bisphenol A in mothers twice during pregnancy in 1999-2000 in Salinas, California. We assessed probable asthma, aeroallergies, eczema, and spirometry in their children at age 7, and measured T helper 1 and T helper 2 cells in blood at ages 2, 5, and 7 (N = 392). We employed Bayesian model averaging to select confounders from additional biomarkers measured in this population and controlled for them in logistic and linear regressions. Results: Monocarboxyisooctyl phthalate was associated with increased odds for probable asthma (odds ratio: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.12), and with lower forced expiratory volume in one second (β: −0.09 L, 95% CI: −0.15, −0.03) and forced expiratory flow from 25% to 75% of forced vital capacity (β: −7.06 L/s, 95% CI: −11.04, −2.90). Several other associations were attenuated in final models that controlled for additional biomarkers. Conclusion: Monocarboxyisooctyl phthalate was associated with lower respiratory health after controlling for related chemical exposure, which suggests that confounding by multiple chemical exposures should be considered in future research. © 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Epidemiological studies have concentrated on the health effects of individual chemicals, despite the understanding that EDCs act together via common mechanisms, that pregnant women are exposed to multiple EDCs simultaneously, and that substantial toxicological evidence of adverse developmental effects has been documented. There is a move toward multipollutant models in environmental epidemiology; however, there is no current consensus on appropriate statistical methods. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review the statistical methods used in these studies, to identify additional applicable methods, and to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each method for addressing the salient statistical and epidemiological challenges. METHODS: We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for epidemiological studies of endocrine-sensitive outcomes in the children of mothers exposed to EDC mixtures during pregnancy and identified alternative statistical methods from the wider literature. DISCUSSION: We identified 74 studies and analyzed the methods used to estimate mixture health effects, identify important mixture components, account for nonmonotonicity in exposure–response relationships, assess interactions, and identify windows of exposure susceptibility. We identified both frequentist and Bayesian methods that are robust to multicollinearity, performing shrinkage, variable selection, dimension reduction, statistical learning, or smoothing, including methods that were not used by the studies included in our review. CONCLUSIONS: Compelling motivation exists for analyzing EDCs as mixtures, yet many studies make simplifying assumptions about EDC additivity, relative potency, and linearity, or overlook the potential for bias due to asymmetries in chemical persistence. We discuss the potential impacts of these choices and suggest alternative methods to improve analyses of prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The existing literature is conflicting, and many studies do not control for multiple chemical exposures. Methods: We quantified concentrations of three phthalate metabolites, three parabens, and four other phenols in urine collected twice during pregnancy from 392 women. We measured T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cells in their children's blood at ages two, five, and seven, and assessed probable asthma, aeroallergies, eczema, and lung function at age seven. We conducted linear and logistic regressions, controlling for additional biomarkers measured in this population as selected by Bayesian Model Averaging. Results: The majority of comparisons showed null associations. Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) was associated with higher Th2% (RR: 10.40, 95% CI: 3.37, 17.92), and methyl paraben was associated with lower Th1% (RR: −3.35, 95% CI: −6.58, −0.02) and Th2% at borderline significance (RR: −4.45, 95% CI: −8.77, 0.08). Monoethyl phthalate was associated with lower forced expiratory flow from 25 to 75% of forced vital capacity (FEF25–75%) (RR: −3.22 L/s, 95% CI: −6.02, −0.34). Propyl paraben (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.99) was associated with decreased odds of probable asthma. Conclusions: While some biomarkers, particularly those from low molecular weight phthalates, were associated with an atopic cytokine profile and poorer lung function, no biomarkers were associated with a corresponding increase in atopic disease. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Allergy; Asthma; Chemical mixtures; Cytokines; Personal care products; Phthalates","Allergies; Bayesian networks; Biological organs; Biomarkers; Boron compounds; Diseases; Manganese compounds; Parabens; Propylparaben; Thorium compounds; Asthma; Chemical mixtures; Cytokines; Personal care products; Phthalates; Phosphorus compounds; 2,4 dichlorophenol; 2,5 dichlorophenol; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; butyl paraben; cytokine; methyl paraben; phenol derivative; phthalic acid; propyl paraben; sulfur; triclosan; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; biological marker; cosmetic; monobutyl phthalate; monoethyl phthalate; phenol derivative; phthalic acid; phthalic acid derivative; allergy; asthma; biomarker; child health; concentration (composition); phthalate; PPCP; pregnancy; respiratory disease; urine; adult; allergy; Article; asthma; child; cohort analysis; cytokine production; eczema; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; groups by age; human; longitudinal study; lung function; molecular weight; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; preschool child; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; respiratory tract disease; school child; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; urine level; young adult; adolescent; asthma; Bayes theorem; chemistry; eczema; environmental exposure; hypersensitivity; male; maternal exposure; urine; Adolescent; Adult; Asthma; Bayes Theorem; Biomarkers; Child; Cohort Studies; Cosmetics; Eczema; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Maternal Exposure; Parabens; Phenols; Phthalic Acids; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Young Adult",,"2,4 dichlorophenol, 120-83-2; 2,5 dichlorophenol, 583-78-8; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester, 8014-02-6; butyl paraben, 94-26-8; methyl paraben, 99-76-3; phthalic acid, 88-99-3; propyl paraben, 94-13-3; sulfur, 13981-57-2, 7704-34-9; triclosan, 3380-34-5; Biomarkers; Cosmetics; monobutyl phthalate; monoethyl phthalate; Parabens; Phenols; phthalic acid; Phthalic Acids",,,"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS: P01ES009605, R01ES021369, R21ES024909, R24ES028529, RC2ES018792

In order to understand the relative efficacy and safety of existing and new treatments for atopic dermatitis, robust mixed comparisons (ie, direct and indirect) would be beneficial. To address this gap, this protocol describes methods for a systematic review and network meta-analysis of systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis. Methods and analysis We will update the search of a previous systematic review, including searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database and the Global Resource of EczemA Trials database in addition to clinical trial protocol registries. Title, abstract and full paper screening as well as data extraction will be conducted in duplicate by independent researchers. Primary outcomes include efficacy with regards to clinician-reported signs and patient-reported symptoms and safety with regards to withdrawal from treatment due to adverse events and the occurrence of serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will include change in quality of life and itch severity. Where possible and appropriate, network meta-analysis will be performed for each outcome using a random-effects model within a Bayesian framework. If appropriate, the review will be transitioned to a living review with continuous updating of the analysis. Ethics and dissemination Dissemination in a peer-reviewed scientific journal is planned.

However, the symptoms indicating this medicine have not yet been assessed systematically. Likelihood ratio (LR), based on Bayesian statistics, may yield better estimation of a medicine's indication than the existing method of entry of symptoms into materia medica and repertories. Methods We investigated LRs of four CD symptoms of VM: (1) great sensitiveness of skin, with redness and soreness from slightest rubbing; (2) weeping eczema with foul, thick crusts; (3) itching amelioration in open air; and (4) CD of scalp. An observational, prospective, patient-outcome study was conducted in five different practice settings on 390 CD patients over 18 months using three outcomes-Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital Outcome Scale (GHHOS), Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months. The LR of each of the four symptoms was estimated as per the patient-rated outcomes on GHHOS. Results Seventy-four VM and 316 non-VM cases were analyzed. Estimated LRs were as follows: symptom 1, 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65 to 2.60); symptom 2, 1.48 (95% CI: 0.80 to 2.74); symptom 3, 1.70 (95% CI: 0.94 to 3.07); symptom 4, 1.36 (95% CI: 0.74 to 2.51). There were statistically significant reductions in SCORAD and DLQI scores over 3 and 6 months. Conclusion There was insufficient evidence to attribute any of the four assessed symptoms clearly to VM. Though non-significant, a high LR was observed for itching amelioration in open air (symptom 3). Symptoms in the homeopathic materia medica for VM are perhaps over-represented. More research of this nature is warranted. © 2018 The Faculty of Homeopathy.","contact dermatitis; homeopathy; likelihood ratio; Vinca minor","homeopathic agent; materia medica; placebo; adult; Article; contact dermatitis; Dermatology Life Quality Index; eczema; female; Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital Outcome Scale; homeopathy; human; India; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; observational study; patient-reported outcome; prospective study; Scoring Atopic Dermatitis; skin disease assessment; skin pruritus; skin redness; Vinca; Vinca minor; atopic dermatitis; follow up; homeopathy; procedures; treatment outcome; Adult; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Homeopathy; Humans; Male; Materia Medica; Placebos; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Vinca",,"Materia Medica; Placebos",,,,,,"Sasseville, D., Occupational contact dermatitis (2008) Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol, 4, pp. 209-2017; Ale, I.S., Maibach, H.I., Irritant contact dermatitis (2014) Rev Environ Health, 29, pp. 195-206; Lachapelle, J.M., Allergic contact dermatitis: Clinical aspects (2014) Rev Environ Health, 29, pp. 185-194; Alchorne, A.O., Alchorne, M.M., Silva, M.M., Occupational dermatosis (2010) An Bras Dermatol, 85, pp. 137-145; Sarma, N., Occupational allergic contact dermatitis among construction workers in India (2009) Indian J Dermatol, 54, pp. 137-141; Anderson, S.E., Meade, B.J., Potential health effects associated with dermal exposure to occupational chemicals (2014) Environ Health Insights, 8, pp. 51-62; Cohen, D.E., Heidary, N., Treatment of irritant and allergic contact dermatitis (2004) Dermatol Ther (Heidelb), 17, pp. 334-340; Holness, D.L., Occupational skin allergies: Testing and treatment (the case of occupational allergic contact dermatitis) (2014) Curr Allergy Asthma Rep, 14, p. 410; Jacobsson, I., Jönsson, A.K., Gerdén, B., Hägg, S., Spontaneously reported adverse reactions in association with complementary and alternative medicine substances in Sweden (2009) Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf, 18, pp. 1039-1047; Noiesen, E., Munk, M.D., Larsen, K., Hoyen, M., Agner, T., Use of complementary and alternative treatment for allergic contact dermatitis (2007) Br J Dermatol, 157, pp. 301-305; Bascom, A., Complementary and alternative therapies in occupational health.

Until recently, CVA6 infections were considered as being of minor clinical significance, and only rarely aetiologically linked with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) associated with other species A enteroviruses (particularly EV71 and CVA16). From 2008 onwards, however, CVA6 infections have been associated with several outbreaks worldwide of atypical HFMD (aHFMD) accompanied by a varicelliform rash. We recently reported CVA6-associated eczema herpeticum occurring predominantly in children and young adults in Edinburgh in January and February 2014. To investigate genetic determinants of novel clinical phenotypes of CVA6, we genetically characterized and analysed CVA6 variants associated with eczema herpeticum in Edinburgh in 2014 and those with aHFMD in CAV isolates collected from 2008. A total of eight recombinant forms (RFs) have circulated worldwide over the past 10 years, with the particularly recent appearance of RF-H associated with eczema herpeticum cases in Edinburgh in 2014. Comparison of phylogenies and divergence of complete genome sequences of CVA6 identified recombination breakpoints in 2A–2C, within VP3, and between 59 untranslated region and VP1. A Bayesian temporal reconstruction of CVA6 evolution since 2004 provided estimates of dates and the actual recombination events that generated more recently appearing recombination groups (RF-E, -F, -G and -H). Associations were observed between recombination groups and clinical presentations of herpangina, aHFMD and eczema herpeticum, but not with VP1 or other structural genes. These observations provided evidence that NS gene regions may potentially contribute to clinical phenotypes and outcomes of CVA6 infection. © 2015 The Authors.",,"protein VP1; virus RNA; 5' untranslated region;

The disease predominantly comprises a type I hypersensitivity reaction, causing severe itching and discomfort that reduce the welfare and commercial value of the horse. It is a multifactorial disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with heritability ranging from 0.16 to 0.27 in various horse breeds. The worldwide prevalence in different horse breeds ranges from 3% to 60%; it is more than 50% in Icelandic horses exported to the European continent and approximately 8% in Swedish-born Icelandic horses. To minimize the influence of environmental effects, we analyzed Swedish-born Icelandic horses to identify genomic regions that regulate susceptibility to IBH. We performed a genomewide association (GWA) study on 104 affected and 105 unaffected Icelandic horses genotyped using Illumina® EquineSNP50 Genotyping BeadChip. Quality control and population stratification analyses were performed with the GenABEL package in R (λ = 0.81). The association analysis was performed using the Bayesian variable selection method, Bayes C, implemented in GenSel software. The highest percentage of genetic variance was explained by the windows on X chromosomes (0.51% and 0.36% by 73 and 74 mb), 17 (0.34% by 77 mb), and 18 (0.34% by 26 mb). Overlapping regions with previous GWA studies were observed on chromosomes 7, 9, and 17. The windows identified in our study on chromosomes 7, 10, and 17 harbored immune system genes and are priorities for further investigation. © The American Genetic Association 2015.

Methods: Allergen-IgE screening using ImmunoCAP ISAC® assay was performed at age 11 yrs in children participating a population-based birth cohort. Logistic regression (LR) and nonlinear statistical learning models, including random forests (RF) and Bayesian networks (BN), coupled with feature selection approaches, were used to identify patterns of allergen responses associated with asthma, rhino-conjunctivitis, wheeze, eczema and airway hyper-reactivity (AHR, positive methacholine challenge). Sensitivity/specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) were used to assess model performance via repeated validation. Results: Serum sample for IgE measurement was obtained from 461 of 822 (56.1%) participants. Two hundred and thirty-eight of 461 (51.6%) children had at least one of 112 allergen components IgE &gt; 0 ISU. The binary threshold &gt;0.3 ISU performed less well than using continuous IgE values, discretizing data or using other data transformations, but not significantly (p = 0.1). With the exception of eczema (AUROC~0.5), LR, RF and BN achieved comparable AUROC, ranging from 0.76 to 0.82. Dust mite, pollens and pet allergens were highly associated with asthma, whilst pollens and dust mite with rhino-conjunctivitis. Egg/bovine allergens were associated with eczema. Conclusions: After validation, LR, RF and BN demonstrated reasonable discrimination ability for asthma, rhino-conjunctivitis, wheeze and AHR, but not for eczema. However, further improvements in threshold ascertainment and/or value transformation for different components, and better interpretation algorithms are needed to fully capitalize on the potential of the technology. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

We hypothesize that this expression does not adequately describe the natural history of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis during childhood. We propose that this paradigm arose from cross-sectional analyses of longitudinal studies, and may reflect a population pattern that may not predominate at the individual level.Data from 9,801 children in two population-based birth cohorts were used to determine individual profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis and whether the manifestations of these symptoms followed an atopic march pattern. Children were assessed at ages 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 y. We used Bayesian machine learning methods to identify distinct latent classes based on individual profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis. This approach allowed us to identify groups of children with similar patterns of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis over time.Using a latent disease profile model, the data were best described by eight latent classes: no disease (51.3%), atopic march (3.1%), persistent eczema and wheeze (2.7%), persistent eczema with later-onset rhinitis (4.7%), persistent wheeze with later-onset rhinitis (5.7%), transient wheeze (7.7%), eczema only (15.3%), and rhinitis only (9.6%). When latent variable modelling was carried out separately for the two cohorts, similar results were obtained. Highly concordant patterns of sensitisation were associated with different profiles of eczema, rhinitis, and wheeze. The main limitation of this study was the difference in wording of the questions used to ascertain the presence of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis in the two cohorts.The developmental profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis are heterogeneous; only a small proportion of children (∼7% of those with symptoms) follow trajectory profiles resembling the atopic march.Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary. © 2014 Belgrave et al.",,"allergy; Article; Bayesian learning; child; cohort analysis; disease severity; eczema; female; follow up; human; longitudinal study; population research; preschool child; prevalence; probability; questionnaire; rhinitis; school child; sensitization; skin test; symptom assessment; wheezing; Bayes theorem; cross-sectional study; eczema; male; pathology; Respiratory Sounds; rhinitis; Bayes Theorem; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Eczema; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Respiratory Sounds; Rhinitis",,,,,"0401540

Causal relationship between medicine and 'cure' could be documented better. Extraordinary cases are not helpful to increase reproducibility. Conclusion: For acceptance and improvement of homeopathy cases should be reproducible. 'Normal' cases reflecting daily practice contribute more to this goal than extraordinary cases.

Some of the inconsistency is caused by the variable selection and demographic and clinical differences among study populations. Objectives: To investigate the effects of the choice of statistical method and different preparations of data on the clustering results; and to relate these to disease severity. Methods: Several variants of EFA and HC were applied and compared using various sets of variables and different encodings and transformations within a dataset of 383 children with asthma. Variables included lung function, inflammatory and allergy markers, family history, environmental exposures, and medications. Clusters and original variables were related to asthma severity (logistic regression and Bayesian network analysis). Measurements and Main Results: EFA identified five components (eigenvalues≥1) explaining 35% of the overall variance. Variations of the HC (as linkage-distance functions) did not affect the cluster inference; however, using different variable encodings and transformations did. The derived clusters predicted asthma severity less than the original variables. Prognostic factors of severity were medication usage, current symptoms, lung function, paternal asthma, bodymass index, and age of asthma onset. Bayesian networks indicated conditional dependence among variables. Conclusions: The use of different unsupervised statistical learning methods and different variable sets and encodings can lead to multiple and inconsistent subgroupings of asthma, not necessarily correlated with severity. The search for asthma phenotypes needs more careful selection of markers, consistent across different study populations, and more cautious interpretation of results from unsupervised learning.

In this contribution, we quantify the discriminative power of such attributes using an information theoretical approach. Methods: We estimate the probability of occurrence of each attribute as a function of the skin diseases. We use the distribution of this probability across the studied diseases and its entropy to define the discriminative power of the attribute. The discriminative power has a maximum value for attributes that occur (or do not occur) for only one disease and a minimum value for those which are equally likely to be observed among all diseases. Results: Verrucous surface, red and brown colors, and the presence of more than 10 lesions are among the most informative attributes. A ranking of attributes is also carried out and used together with a naive Bayesian classifier, yielding results that confirm the soundness of the proposed method. Conclusion: proposed measure is proven to be a reliable way of assessing the discriminative power of dermatological attributes, and it also helps generate a condensed dermatological lexicon. Therefore, it can be of added value to the manual or computer-aided diagnostic process. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Dermatological lexicon; Discriminative power; Entropy; Information theory; Skin lesion","Added values; Brown color; Computer aided diagnostics; Dermatological lexicon; Diagnostic process; Discriminative power; Informative attributes; Minimum value; Naive Bayesian Classifier; Probability of occurrence; Skin disease; Skin lesion; Theoretical approach; Visual attributes; Dermatology; Entropy; Information theory; Probability distributions; Diagnosis; article; Bayes theorem; book; causal attribution; dermatology; eczema; entropy; human; mathematical computing; mycosis; probability; psoriasis; skin color; skin disease; skin surface; squamous cell carcinoma; theoretical study; verrucous carcinoma; vision; visual discrimination; Bayes Theorem; Color; Databases, Factual; Dermatology; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Entropy; Humans; Information Theory; Models, Biological; Skin; Skin Diseases",,,,,,,,"Brooks, G.J., Ashton, R.E., Pethybridge, R.J., DERMIS: a computer system for assisting primary-care physicians with dermatological diagnosis (1992) British J Dermatol, 12, pp. 614-619; Smith, H.R., Initial use of a computer system for assisting dermatological diagnosis in general practice (2000) Med Inform Internet Med, 25, pp. 103-108; Burroni, M., Sbano, P., Cevenini, G., Risulo, M., Dell'eva, G., Barbini, P., Miracco, C., Rubegni, P., Dysplastic naevus vs. in situ melanoma: digital dermoscopy analysis (2005) Br J Dermatol, 152, pp. 679-684; Johnke, H., Vach, W., Norberg, L.A., Bindslev-Jensen, C., Host, A., Andersen, K.E., A comparison between criteria for diagnosing atopic eczema in infants (2005) British J Dermatol, 153, pp. 352-358; Maglogiannis, I., Doukas, C.N., Overview of advanced computer vision systems for skin lesions characterization (2009) Inf Technol Biomed IEEE Trans, 13, pp. 721-733; Furey, T.S., Cristianini, N., Duffy, N., Bednarski, D.W., Schummer, M., Haussler, D., Support vector machines classification and validation of cancer tissue samples using microarray expression data (2000) Bioinformatics, 16, pp. 906-914; Miyahara, K., Pazzani, M.J., Collaborative filtering with the simple Bayesian classifier (2000) Proceedings of the 6th Pacific Rim international conference on artificial intelligence, pp. 679-689. , Mizoguchi R and Slaney J, eds.

However, only a few variants in these genes have been associated with either disease. We investigate the association between polymorphisms of genes in the innate immune pathway with childhood asthma and eczema. In addition, we compare individual associations with those discovered using a multivariate approach. Methods: Using a novel method, case control based association testing (C2BAT), 569 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 44 innate immune genes were tested for association with asthma and eczema in children from the Boston Home Allergens and Asthma Study and the Connecticut Childhood Asthma Study. The screening algorithm was used to identify the top SNPs associated with asthma and eczema. We next investigated the interaction of innate immune variants with asthma and eczema risk using Bayesian networks. Results: After correction for multiple comparisons, 7 SNPs in 6 genes (CARD25, TGFB1, LY96, ACAA1, DEFB1, and IFNG) were associated with asthma (adjusted p-value<0.02), while 5 SNPs in 3 different genes (CD80, STAT4, and IRAKI) were significantly associated with eczema (adjusted p-value < 0.02). None of these SNPs were associated with both asthma and eczema. Bayesian network analysis identified 4 SNPs that were predictive of asthma and 10 SNPs that predicted eczema. Of the genes identified using Bayesian networks, only CD80 was associated with eczema in the single-SNP study. Using novel methodology that allows for screening and replication in the same population, we have identified associations of innate immune genes with asthma and eczema. Bayesian network analysis suggests that additional SNPs influence disease susceptibility via SNP interactions. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that innate immune genes contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and eczema, and that these diseases likely have different genetic determinants. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Asthma; Bayesian network; Eczema; Genetic association; Innate immunity","B7 antigen; caspase recruitment domain protein 15; gamma interferon; interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1; protein MD 2; STAT4 protein; transforming growth factor beta1; 5' untranslated region; article; asthma; Bayes theorem; child; controlled study; disease association; disease predisposition; eczema; exon; family history; female; gene frequency; gene interaction; genetic association; genetic screening; genetic selection; genetic variability; genotype; human; immune response gene; innate immunity; intron; major clinical study; male; predictive validity; predictive value; preschool child; priority journal; promoter region; single nucleotide polymorphism; Algorithms; Asthma; Bayes Theorem; Child, Preschool; Eczema; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,"gamma interferon, 82115-62-6",,,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: K08HL096833, K99HL105663, K99HL109162, R00HL096840

Diagnostic associations between common reasons for encounter (RfEs) and episodes titles are compared and similarities and differences are described and analysed. Methodology: Participating family doctors (FDs) recorded details of all their patient contacts in an 'episode of care (EoC)' structure using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC). RfEs presented by the patient and episode titles (diagnostic labels of EoCs) were classified with ICPC. The relationships between RfEs and episode titles were studied with Bayesian methods. Results: Distributions of diagnostic odds ratios (ORs) from the three population databases are presented and compared. Conclusions: ICPC, the RfE and the EoC data model are appropriate tools to study the process of diagnosis in FM. Distributions of diagnostic associations between RfEs and episode titles in the Transition Project international populations show remarkable similarities and congruencies in the process of diagnosis from both the RfE and the episode title perspectives. The congruence of diagnostic associations between populations supports the use of such data from one population to inform diagnostic decisions in another. Differences in themagnitude of such diagnostic associations are significant, and population-specific data are therefore desirable. We propose that both an international (common) and a local (health care system specific) content of FM exist and that the empirical distributions of diagnostic associations presented in this paper are a reflection of both these effects. We also observed that the frequency of exposure to such diagnostic challenges had a strong effect on the confidence intervals of diagnostic ORs reflecting these diagnostic associations. We propose that this constitutes evidence that expertise in FM is associated with frequency of exposure to diagnostic challenges. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

Data consisted of 3,453 Dutch Friesian broodmares with 3,763 visual observations on IBH clinical symptoms scored by 12 inspectors during organized foal inspections in 2004 and 2008. Nine percent of the mares (n = 310) were scored in both years. Mares descended from 144 sires and 2,554 dams and 26.2% of the dams (n = 669) had more than 1 offspring in the data set (range: 2 to 6). Insect bite hypersensitivity was analyzed as a binary trait with a threshold animal model with and without a maternal effect, using a Bayesian approach. Observed IBH prevalence in Dutch Friesian broodmare population was 18.2%. Heritability on the liability scale was 0.16 (SD = 0.06); heritability on the observed scale was 0.07; and repeatability was 0.89 (SD = 0.03). Maternal effect was 0.17 (SD = 0.06) and significantly differed from zero, although the animal model without a maternal effect fitted the data better. These results show that genetic and permanent environmental factors affect IBH in Dutch Friesian horses. The dam affected the IBH development of her offspring through an additive genetic influence but also by being part of their rearing environment. © 2011 American Society of Animal Science.

Methods: All reports of alopecia with marketed SSRIs until the end of 2004 were identified in SWEDIS, the national Swedish database for spontaneously reported ADRs, and in Vigibase, the international ADR database of the World Health Organization. Total SSRI sales volumes in Sweden until the end of 2004 were obtained from the National Corporation of Swedish Pharmacies. The Bayes' Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) method was used to estimate associations between alopecia and each of the SSRIs within the two databases. Results: A total of 27 reports of alopecia were identified in SWEDIS. As two reports concerned the use of two SSRIs, there was a total of 29 drug-ADR combinations. All except dime reports concerned women (88.9%). The reporting rate of alopecia in Sweden was significantly higher with sertraline compared with citalopram; 20.1 (95%CI 10.7-34.4) reports per million patient-years versus 4.5 (95%CI 1.8-9.3) reports per million patient-years. No significant differences in reporting rates were noted for the remaining SSRIs. Sertraline also showed a statistically significant association with alopecia in both SWEDIS and Vigibase. Citalopram was significantly associated with alopecia in Vigibase, but not in SWEDIS. No statistically significant associations were found for any of the other SSRIs. Conclusions: Alopecia appears to be a rare ADR to SSRIs. The risk of alopecia seems to vary between the different SSRIs, and might be higher in women than in men.

METHODS: A final diagnosis of asthma can be made only after full clinical assessment but limited resources make it impossible to offer this to complete populations as part of a screening programme. Prioritisation is required so that review can be offered most promptly to those most in need. A stratified random sample of 180 from 6825 respondents to a community survey underwent clinical review. They were categorised according to likelihood of asthma by three independent experts whose opinions were combined into a single probability label for each patient. A neural network was trained to relate questionnaire responses to probability labels. The trained network was applied to the whole community to produce a ranking order based on likelihood of asthma. A screening threshold could then be set to correspond to available resources, and patients above this level with no recorded evidence of asthma diagnosis could be assessed clinically. Using the known probability labels from the training set, it was possible to derive the expected proportion of true asthmatics in any set of patients. RESULTS: If the screening threshold had been set to capture the top 10% of the ranked population (n = 683), then 239 patients above this threshold had no evidence of diagnosis and would need assessment. Of these, it would be expected that 74% would have the diagnosis confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: This approach allows prioritisation of a population where resources for diagnostic examination are limited.
