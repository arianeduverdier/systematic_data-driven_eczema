Here, we aimed to establish a novel method to detect scratching using deep neural network. Scratching was elicited by injecting a chemical pruritogen lysophosphatidic acid to the back of a mouse, and behaviour was recorded using a standard handy camera. Images showing differences between two consecutive frames in each video were generated, and each frame was manually labelled as showing scratching behaviour or not. Next, a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), composed of sequential convolution, recurrent, and fully connected blocks, was constructed. The CRNN was trained using the manually labelled images and then evaluated for accuracy using a first-look dataset. Sensitivity and positive predictive rates reached 81.6% and 87.9%, respectively. The predicted number and durations of scratching events correlated with those of the human observation. The trained CRNN could also successfully detect scratching in the hapten-induced atopic dermatitis mouse model (sensitivity, 94.8%; positive predictive rate, 82.1%). In conclusion, we established a novel scratching detection method using CRNN and showed that it can be used to study disease models. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,,,,,"Takeda Science Foundation

Objective measurements of nighttime scratching and sleep quantity can help assess the efficacy of an intervention. Wearable sensors can provide novel, objective measures of nighttime scratching and sleep; however, many current approaches were not designed for passive, unsupervised monitoring during daily life. In this work, we present the development and analytical validation of a method that sequentially processes epochs of sample-level accelerometer data from a wrist-worn device to provide continuous digital measures of nighttime scratching and sleep quantity. This approach uses heuristic and machine learning algorithms in a hierarchical paradigm by first determining when the patient intends to sleep, then detecting sleep–wake states along with scratching episodes, and lastly deriving objective measures of both sleep and scratch. Leveraging reference data collected in a sleep laboratory (NCT ID: NCT03490877), results show that sensor-derived measures of total sleep opportunity (TSO; time when patient intends to sleep) and total sleep time (TST) correlate well with reference polysomnography data (TSO: r = 0.72, p < 0.001; TST: r = 0.76, p < 0.001; N = 32). Log transformed sensor derived measures of total scratching duration achieve strong agreement with reference annotated video recordings (r = 0.82, p < 0.001; N = 25). These results support the use of wearable sensors for objective, continuous measurement of nighttime scratching and sleep during daily life. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,,,,,"Pfizer",,,,"Kapur, S., Watson, W., Carr, S., Atopic dermatitis (2018) Allergy Asthma Clin.

This warrants development of measures to predict and prevent these conditions. We aimed to investigate the predictive ability of a spectrum of data mining methods to predict childhood AD and AR using longitudinal birth cohort data. We conducted a 14-year follow-up of infants born to pregnant women who had undergone maternal examinations at nine selected maternity hospitals across Taiwan during 2000–2005. The subjects were interviewed using structured questionnaires to record data on basic demographics, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, medical history, and 24-h dietary recall. Hourly concentrations of air pollutants within 1 year before childbirth were obtained from 76 national air quality monitoring stations in Taiwan. We utilized weighted K-nearest neighbour method (k = 3) to infer the personalized air pollution exposure. Machine learning methods were performed on the heterogeneous attributes set to predict allergic diseases in children. A total of 1439 mother-infant pairs were recruited in machine learning analysis. The prevalence of AD and AR in children up to 14 years of age were 6.8% and 15.9%, respectively. Overall, tree-based models achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than other methods, with areas under receiver operating characteristic curve of 83% for AD and 84% for AR, respectively. Our findings confirmed that prenatal air quality is an important factor affecting the predictive ability. Moreover, different air quality indices were better predicted, in combination than separately. Combining heterogeneous attributes including environmental exposures, demographic information, and allergens is the key to a better prediction of children allergies in the general population. Prenatal exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and its concatenation changes with time were significant predictors for AD and AR till adolescent. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Allergic diseases; Birth cohort; Machine learning; Prediction",,,,,,"National Health Research Institutes, NHRI: EM-107-PP-05, EM-108-PP-05, PH-106-PP-09

However, population-level disease incidence patterns do not necessarily reflect the development of allergic disease in individuals. A better understanding of the factors that predispose to different allergic trajectories is needed. Objective: Our aim was to determine the demographic and genetic features that are associated with the major allergic march trajectories. Methods: Presence or absence of common allergic conditions (atopic dermatitis [AD], IgE-mediated food allergy [IgE-FA], asthma, and allergic rhinitis [AR]) was ascertained in a pediatric primary care birth cohort of 158,510 subjects. Hierarchic clustering and decision tree modeling were used to associate demographic features with allergic outcomes. Genome-wide association study was used to test for risk loci associated with specific allergic trajectories. Results: We found an association between self-identified black race and progression from AD to asthma. Conversely, Asian or Pacific Islander race was associated with progression from AD to IgE-mediated food allergy, and white race was associated with progression from AD to AR. Genome-wide association study of trajectory groups identified risk loci associated with progression from AD to asthma (rs60242841) and from AD to AR (rs9565267, rs151041509, and rs78171803). Consistent with our epidemiologic associations, rs60242841 was more common in individuals of African ancestry than in individuals of European ancestry, whereas rs9565267 and rs151041509 were more common in individuals of European ancestry than in individuals of African ancestry. Conclusion: We have identified novel associations between race and progression along distinct allergic trajectories. Ancestral genetic differences may contribute to these associations. These results uncover important health disparities, refine the concept of the allergic march, and represent a step toward developing individualized medical approaches for these conditions. © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","allergic march; allergic rhinitis; allergic trajectory; asthma; atopic dermatitis; Atopic march; epidemiology; genome-wide association study; IgE-mediated food allergy",,,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: AI116794, DK116668, LM010098, LM012601

The accurate therapy requires an objective method to examine the skin condition. However, there is a lack of standardization of diagnostic criteria using high-resolution, non-invasive methods. Therefore, we are faced with a need for accurate assessment and monitoring of treatment results. The newest clinical research mention the benefit of using high frequency ultrasound in skin condition analysis. With the use of high frequency ultrasound it is possible to segment and then measure the hypoechoic band below the echo entry (subepidermal low echogenic band), characteristic for atopic dermatitis. In this study we developed a two-step methodology consisting of the region of interest detection and segmentation based on convolutional neural network with a U-net architecture. The accuracy of the proposed framework was verified using 47 clinical images annotated by an expert, yielding mean Dice index value of 0.86±0.04 and mean error of the hypoechoic band thickness estimation at 12.0±9.3 μm. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Atopic dermatitis; Deep learning; High frequency ultrasound; SLEB segmentation","Clinical research; Convolutional neural networks; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Noninvasive medical procedures; Thickness measurement; Ultrasonic applications; Assessment and monitoring; Atopic dermatitis; High frequency ultrasounds; Learning approach; Noninvasive methods; Objective methods; Region of interest; Thickness estimation; Deep learning",,,,,"Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN: 2016/21/B/ST7/02236","Fig. 4 Final SLEB segmentation results in three different cases of full test images (rows 1–3): left— fully automated segmentation result, right—expert mask; SLEB region indicated by brightened area Acknowledgements This research is supported by the Polish National Science Centre (NCN) grant No.: 2016/21/B/ST7/02236.

This article covers the basic concepts of cost-utility analyses and reviews the available literature on cost utility of biologic drugs in atopic disorders. When used within their limits as part of a multi-dimensional assessment, economic analyses can be extremely useful to guide decision-making and prioritization of care. Despite the good quality of most cost-utility analyses conducted for the use of biologics in asthma and other atopic diseases, their conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness are extremely variable. This is mainly due to the use of inconsistent estimates of health utility benefit with therapy. Development of reliable and validated instruments to measure disutility in atopic disorders and measure of indirect costs in atopic disease are identified as a priority for future research. © 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Methods: This retrospective study compared the clinical features of patients with SA-NVO and NSA-NVO who were diagnosed from 2004 to 2019. Univariate associations were assessed using χ2, Fisher's exact, or Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariable analysis was conducted using logistic regression. The optimal age cutoff point was determined by classification and regression tree analysis. Results: Among 155 NVO patients, 98 (63.2%) had a microbiologically confirmed diagnosis: 40 (25.8%) with SA-NVO and 58 (37.4%) with NSA-NVO. Six predictors, either independently associated with SA-NVO or clinically relevant, were used to develop the STAPH prediction score: Atopic dermatitis (Skin) (3 points); recent Trauma (2 points); Age<67 years (1 point); Abscess (1 point); central venous Port catheter (2 points); and History of puncture (2 points). In a receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under the curve was 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.91). The best cutoff point was 3. A score ≥3 had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 58%, 84%, 84%, and 73%, respectively. Conclusions: The STAPH score has relatively high specificity for use by clinicians to predict SA as the causative microorganism in patients with NVO until results of a confirmatory culture are available. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Recent study showed low frequency of filaggrin loss-of-function (FLG LOF) mutations in Croatian AD patients. At present, there are no data on biomarkers of immune response in Croatian AD patients that might be useful in the selection and monitoring of novel immune therapies. Objectives: To investigate levels of cytokines of various signature in the stratum corneum (SC) collected from lesional and non-lesional skin of AD patients and healthy controls and to evaluate their relationship with the severity of disease and skin barrier function. Methods: SC samples were collected from 100 adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD and 50 healthy controls. The levels of 21 cytokines were measured by multiplex immunoassay. We conducted machine learning analysis to assess whether a small number of cytokine measurements can discriminate between healthy controls and AD patients and can predict AD severity (SCORAD). Results: The SC levels of thirteen cytokines representing innate immunity, Th-1, Th-2 and Th-17/22 immune response showed significant differences between healthy and AD skin. Our analysis demonstrated that as few as three cytokines measured in lesional skin can discriminate healthy controls and AD with an accuracy of 99% and that the predictive models for SCORAD did not achieve a high accuracy. Cytokine levels were highly correlated with the levels of filaggrin degradation products and skin barrier function. Conclusions: Stratum corneum analysis revealed aberrant levels of cytokines representing innate immunity, Th-1-, Th-2- and Th-17/22-mediated immune response in Croatian AD patients. Increased Th-2 cytokines and their strong association with natural moisturizing factor (NMF) can explain low NMF levels despite of low frequency of FLG LOF mutations in Croatian population. Predictive models for SCORAD identified cytokines associated with SCORAD but warrants further investigation. © 2021 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",,,,,,,,,,,"Williams, H., Stewart, A., von Mutius, E., Is eczema really on the increase worldwide?

The initiation of a type 2 immune response involves an intricate crosstalk between structural and immune cells. Structural cells react to physical and chemical tissue perturbations by secreting alarmins, which signal the innate immune system to restore homeostasis. This pathway acts autonomously in the context of sterile injury and in the presence of foreign antigen initiates an adaptive Th2 response that is beneficial in the context of venoms, toxins, and helminths, but not food allergens. The investigation of the triggers and mechanisms underlying food allergic sensitization in humans is elusive because sensitization is a silent process. Therefore, the central construct driving food allergy modeling is based on introducing perturbations of tissue homeostasis along with an allergen which will result in an immunological and clinical phenotype that is consistent with that observed in humans. The collective evidence from multiple models has revealed the pre-eminent role of innate cells and molecules in the elicitation of allergic sensitization. We posit that, with the expanding use of technologies capable of producing formidable datasets, models of food allergy will continue to have an indispensable role to delineate mechanisms and establish causal relationships. © Copyright © 2020 Bruton, Koenig, Phelps and Jordana.","animal modeling; food allergy; homeostasis; Th2; type 2 immunity","alarmin; allergen; aluminum hydroxide; amphiregulin; autoantibody; cytokine; filaggrin; gamma interferon; histamine; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 13; interleukin 5; poison; Staphylococcus enterotoxin B; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; toxin; transcription factor GATA 3; tumor necrosis factor; uric acid; venom; adaptive immunity; allergy; anaphylactoid purpura; anaphylaxis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antigen presenting cell; asthma; atopic dermatitis; autoimmune disease; bioinformatics; Bordetella pertussis; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell differentiation; dendritic cell; dog; dysbiosis; eczema; energy expenditure; Escherichia coli; flow cytometry; gene expression; genotype; helminth; homeostasis; human; immune response; immune system; immunocompetent cell; immunological tolerance; inflammation; injury; innate immunity; lymphoid cell; machine learning; microbiome; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; prick test; protein expression; pruritus; Review; RNA sequence; seizure; sensitization; single cell RNA seq; Th2 cell; urticaria; wheezing; wound healing",,"aluminum hydroxide, 1330-44-5, 20257-20-9, 21645-51-2, 80206-84-4; amphiregulin, 117147-70-3; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; histamine, 51-45-6, 56-92-8, 93443-21-1; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; interleukin 12, 138415-13-1; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, 39424-53-8; transcription factor GATA 3, 137878-55-8; uric acid, 69-93-2",,,"Canadian Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Foundation, CAAIF

Nevertheless, the analysis of MPT data is still time-consuming and operator dependent. We propose a fully automatic approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to fully realize the potential of MPT. In total, 3,663 MPT images combining both morphological and metabolic information were acquired from atopic dermatitis (AD) patients and healthy volunteers. These were used to train and tune CNNs to detect the presence of living cells, and if so, to diagnose AD, independently of imaged layer or position. The proposed algorithm correctly diagnosed AD in 97.0 ± 0.2% of all images presenting living cells. The diagnosis was obtained with a sensitivity of 0.966 ± 0.003, specificity of 0.977 ± 0.003 and F-score of 0.964 ± 0.002. Relevance propagation by deep Taylor decomposition was used to enhance the algorithm’s interpretability. Obtained heatmaps show what aspects of the images are important for a given classification. We showed that MPT imaging can be combined with artificial intelligence to successfully diagnose AD. The proposed approach serves as a framework for the automatic diagnosis of skin disorders using MPT. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"artificial intelligence; atopic dermatitis; diagnostic imaging; fluorescence imaging; human; image processing; machine learning; pathology; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; tomography; Artificial Intelligence; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Optical Imaging; ROC Curve; Tomography",,,,,"726666

Several air pollutants, including volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, toluene, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter, act as risk factors for the development or aggravation of atopic dermatitis (AD). We evaluated the impact of air pollutants and weather changes on AD patients. Materials and Methods: Sixty AD patients ≥5 years of age (mean age: 23.5 ± 12.5 years), living in the Campania Region (Southern Italy), were followed for 18 months. The primary outcome was the effect of atmospheric and climatic factors on signs and symptoms of AD, assessed using the SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) index. We measured mean daily temperature (TOD), outdoor relative humidity (RH), diurnal temperature range (DTR), precipitation, particulate with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm (PM10), NO2, tropospheric ozone (O3), and total pollen count (TPC). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine the associations of AD signs and symptoms with these factors. An artificial neural network (ANN) analysis investigated the relationships between weather changes, environmental pollutants, and AD severity. Results: The severity of AD symptoms was positively correlated with outdoor temperatures (TOD, DTR), RH, precipitation, PM10, NO2, O3, and TPC. The ANN analysis also showed a good discrimination performance (75.46%) in predicting disease severity based on environmental pollution data, but weather-related factors were less predictive. Conclusion: The results of the present study provide evidence that weather changes and air pollutions have a significant impact on skin reactivity and symptoms in AD patients, increasing the severity of the dermatitis. The knowledge of the single variables proportion on AD severity symptoms is important to propose alerts for exacerbations in patients with AD of each age. This finding represents a good starting point for further future research in an area of increasingly growing interest. © 2020 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","air pollution; atopic dermatitis; climate change; weather","nitric oxide; ozone; rain; adolescent; adult; air pollutant; Article; artificial neural network; atopic dermatitis; child; circadian rhythm; climate change; controlled study; disease severity; environmental temperature; female; human; humidity; Italy; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; observational study; particulate matter exposure; pollen; precipitation; priority journal; prospective study; Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis; troposphere",,"nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,"The authors must gratefully acknowledge and appreciate Paolo Senatore (Salerno, Italy) for revising and editing the paper.",,,"Hassoun, Y., James, C., Bernstein, D.I., The effects of air pollution on the development of atopic disease (2019) Clin Rev Allergy Immunol, 57 (3), pp. 403-414; Patella, V., Florio, G., Magliacane, D., Air pollution and climate change task force of the Italian Society of Allergology, Asthma and Clinical Immunology (SIAAIC) (2018) Clin Mol Allergy, 16, p. 20; de Hartog, J.J., Hoek, G., Mirme, A., Relationship between different size classes of particulate matter and meteorology in three European cities (2005) J Environ Monit, 7, pp. 302-310; Donaldson, K., Stone, V., Clouter, A., Renwick, L., MacNee, W., Ultrafine particles (2001) Occup Environ Med, 58 (3), pp. 211-216; D’Amato, G., Cecchi, L., D’Amato, M., Annesi-Maesano, I., Climate change and respiratory diseases (2014) Eur Respir Rev, 23, pp. 161-169; D’Amato, G., Effects of climatic changes and urban air pollution on the rising trends of respiratory allergy and asthma (2011) Multidiscip Respir Med, 6 (1), pp. 28-37; Takano, H., Inoue, K.-I., Environmental pollution and allergies (2017) J Toxicol Pathol, 30, pp. 193-199; Morgenstern, V., Zutavern, A., Cyrys, J., Atopic diseases, allergic sensitization, and exposure to traffic-related air pollution in children (2008) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 177, pp. 1331-1337; Patella, V., Florio, G., Magliacane, D., Public prevention plans to manage climate change and respiratory allergic diseases. innovative models used in campania region (Italy): the twinning aria implementation and the allergy safe tree decalogue (2019) Transl Med UniSa, 19 (14), pp. 95-102; Bonamonte, D., Filoni, A., Vestita, M., Romita, P., Foti, C., Angelini, G., The role of the environmental risk factors in the pathogenesis and clinical outcome of atopic dermatitis (2019) BioMed Res Int, 2019, pp. 1-11; Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis (2008) N Engl J Med, 358, pp. 1483-1494; Topol, E.J., High-performance medicine: the convergence of human and artificial intelligence (2019) Nat Med, 25 (1), pp. 44-56; Benjamins, J.W., Hendriks, T., Knuuti, J., Juarez-Orozco, L.E., van der Harst, P., A primer in artificial intelligence in cardiovascular medicine (2019) Neth Heart J, 27 (9), pp. 392-402; Papantonopoulos, G., Takahashi, K., Bountis, T., Loos, B.G., Artificial neural networks for the diagnosis of aggressive periodontitis trained by immunologic parameters (2014) PLoS One, 9 (3); Kebede, M., Zegeye, D.T., Zeleke, B.M., Predicting CD4 count changes among patients on antiretroviral treatment: application of data mining techniques (2017) Comput Methods Programs Biomed, 152, pp. 149-157; Hanifin, J.M., Rajka, G., Diagnostic features of atopic dermatitis (1980) Acta Derm Venereol (Stockh) Suppl, 92, pp. 44-47; Lioy, P.J., Wainman, T., An intercomparison of the indoor air sampling impactor and the dichotomous sampler for a 10-mm cut size (1988) J.

Designing personalized treatment strategies for AD is challenging, given the apparent unpredictability and large variation in AD symptoms and treatment responses within and across individuals. Better prediction of AD severity over time for individual patients could help to select optimum timing and type of treatment for improving disease control. Objective: We aimed to develop a proof of principle mechanistic machine learning model that predicts the patient-specific evolution of AD severity scores on a daily basis. Methods: We designed a probabilistic predictive model and trained it using Bayesian inference with the longitudinal data from two published clinical studies. The data consisted of daily recordings of AD severity scores and treatments used by 59 and 334 AD children over 6 months and 16 weeks, respectively. Validation of the predictive model was conducted in a forward-chaining setting. Results: Our model was able to predict future severity scores at the individual level and improved chance-level forecast by 60%. Heterogeneous patterns in severity trajectories were captured with patient-specific parameters such as the short-term persistence of AD severity and responsiveness to topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors and step-up treatment. Conclusions: Our proof of principle model successfully predicted the daily evolution of AD severity scores at an individual level and could inform the design of personalized treatment strategies that can be tested in future studies. Our model-based approach can be applied to other diseases with apparent unpredictability and large variation in symptoms and treatment responses such as asthma. © 2020 The Authors.

Objective: To develop a convolutional neural network model to classify clinically relevant selected multiple-lesion skin diseases, this in accordance to the STARD guidelines. Methods: This was an image-based retrospective study using multi-task learning for binary classification. A VGG-16 model was trained on 16,543 non-standardized images. Image data was distributed in training set (80%), validation set (10%), and test set (10%). All images were collected from a clinical database of a Danish population attending one dermatological department. Included was patients categorized with ICD-10 codes related to acne, rosacea, psoriasis, eczema, and cutaneous t-cell lymphoma. Results: Acne was distinguished from rosacea with a sensitivity of 85.42% CI 72.24–93.93% and a specificity of 89.53% CI 83.97–93.68%, cutaneous t-cell lymphoma was distinguished from eczema with a sensitivity of 74.29% CI 67.82–80.05% and a specificity of 84.09% CI 80.83–86.99%, and psoriasis from eczema with a sensitivity of 81.79% CI 78.51–84.76% and a specificity of 73.57% CI 69.76–77.13%. All results were based on the test set. Conclusion: The performance rates reported were equal or superior to those reported for general practitioners with dermatological training, indicating that computer-aided diagnostic models based on convolutional neural network may potentially be employed for diagnosing multiple-lesion skin diseases. © Copyright © 2020 Thomsen, Christensen, Iversen, Lomholt and Winther.","acne; cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL); deep neural network (DNN); dermatology; ezcema; psoriasis; rosacea; skin disease","Article; atopic dermatitis; binary classification; contact dermatitis; convolutional neural network; cutaneous T cell lymphoma; Denmark; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; eczema; feasibility study; human; ICD-10; information processing; k means clustering; major clinical study; practice guideline; predictive value; psoriasis; retrospective study; rosacea; sensitivity and specificity; skin defect; visual memory",,,,,,,,,"Hay, R.J., Johns, N.E., Williams, H.C., Bolliger, I.W., Dellavalle, R.P., Margolis, D.J., The global burden of skin disease in 2010: an analysis of the prevalence and impact of skin conditions (2014) J Invest Dermatol, 134, pp. 1527-1534. , 24166134; Julian, C.G., Dermatology in general practice (1999) Br J Dermatol, 141, pp. 518-520. , 10583058; Verhoeven, E.W., Kraaimaat, F.W., van Weel, C., van de Kerkhof, P.C., Duller, P., van der Valk, P.G., Skin diseases in family medicine: prevalence and health care use (2008) Ann Fam Med, 6, pp. 349-354. , 18626035; DermNet, N.Z., (2019), http://www.dermnetnz.org/, Available online at:, (Accessed February 16, 2019; Federman, D.G., Kirsner, R.S., The abilities of primary care physicians in dermatology: implications for quality of care (2017) Am J Manag Care, 3, pp. 1487-1492. , 10178455; Barrett, M., Luu, M., Differential diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (2017) Immunol Allergy Clin North Am, 37, pp. 11-34. , 27886900; Feng, H., Berk-Krauss, J., Feng, P.W., Stein, J.A., Comparison of dermatologist density between urban and rural counties in the United States (2018) JAMA Dermatol, 154, pp. 1265-1271. , 30193349; Thomsen, K., Iversen, L., Titlestad, T.L., Winther, O., Systematic review of machine learning for diagnosis and prognosis in dermatology (2019) J Dermatol Treat, , 31625775; Brinker, T.J., Hekler, A., Enk, A.H., Klode, J., Hauschild, A., Berking, C., Deep learning outperformed 136 of 157 dermatologists in a head-to-head dermoscopic melanoma image classification task (2019) Eur J Cancer, 113, pp. 47-54. , 30981091; Esteva, A., Kuprel, B., Novoa, R.A., Ko, J., Swetter, S.M., Blau, H.M., Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks (2017) Nature, 542, pp. 115-118. , 28117445; Han, S.S., Park, G.H., Lim, W., Kim, M.S., Na, J.I., Park, I., Deep neural networks show an equivalent and often superior performance to dermatologists in onychomycosis diagnosis: Automatic construction of onychomycosis datasets by region-based convolutional deep neural network (2018) PLoS ONE, 13, p. e0191493. , 29352285; Liu, Y., Jain, A., Eng, C., Way, D.H., Lee, K., Bui, P., A deep learning system for differential diagnosis of skin diseases (2019) EESS, , 32424212, (,); Wu, H., Yin, H., Chen, H., Sun, M., Liu, X., Yu, Y., A deep learning, image based approach for automated diagnosis for inflammatory skin diseases (2020) Ann Transl Med, 8, p. 581. , 32566608; Kim, Y.J., Han, S.S., Yang, H.J., Chang, S.E., Prospective, comparative evaluation of a deep neural network and dermoscopy in the diagnosis of onychomycosis (2020) PLoS ONE, 15, p. e0234334. , 32525908; Tschandl, P., Rinner, C., Apalla, Z., Argenziano, G., Codella, N., Halpern, A., Human-computer collaboration for skin cancer recognition (2020) Nat Med, 26, pp. 1229-1234. , 32572267; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Adv Neural Inform Process Syst, 1, pp. 1097-1105; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition (2014) ICLR; Cohen, J.F., Korevaar, D.A., Altman, D.G., Bruns, D.E., Gatsonis, C.A., Hooft, L., STARD 2015 guidelines for reporting diagnostic accuracy studies: explanation and elaboration (2016) BMJ open, 6, p. e012799. , 28137831; Solomon, B.A., Collins, R., Silverberg, N.B., Glass, A.T., Quality of care: issue or oversight in health care reform?

It is a kind of disease that is visible to human eyes which makes carriers susceptible to shame and may cause people to keep distance from them. Even though it is visible to human eyes, people are unaware of what kind of skin disease they have, and with this, people would go to dermatological clinics to have their skin checked, and to have a diagnosis. In line with this, the proponents created a system that detects and classifies skin diseases, particularly acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, keratosis pilaris (Chicken Skin), psoriasis, leprosy, and warts. This research has used different pre-processing and segmentation algorithms to successfully extract features (texture, edge, and color). The extracted features were contained as a feature vector and were used to train the Support Vector Machine classifier and the Artificial Neural Network classifier. For the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the model peaked an average of 93.55% and 93.33% for precision and recall, respectively, and for the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier, it peaked 96.55% for precision and 100% for recall. © 2020 ACM.","machine learning classification; pre-processing algorithms; Skin diseases","Application programs; Big data; Dermatitis; Dermatology; Developing countries; Diagnosis; Image classification; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Textures; Artificial neural network classifiers; Atopic dermatitis; Feature vectors; Machine learning classification; Precision and recall; Segmentation algorithms; Support vector machine classifiers; Tropical climates; Support vector machines",,,,,,,,,"Kumar, V.B., Kumar, S.S., Saboo, V., Dermatological disease detection using image processing and machine learning (2016) Third International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition (AIPR), 2016, pp. 1-6; Ajith, A., Goel, V., Vazirani, P., Roja, M.M., Digital dermatology: Skin disease detection model using image processing (2017) International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems (ICICCS).

AD). We examined the symptoms related to asthma and AD and the plasma levels of 72 cytokines/chemokines obtained from a general population of 161 children at 6 years of age who participated in a pilot birth cohort study of the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS). The children whose signs and symptoms fulfilled the criteria of AD, which are mostly based on questionnaire including past symptoms, tended to have higher levels of the two chemokine ligands, CCL17 and CCL27, which are used for diagnosis of AD. On the other hand, another AD-related chemokine CCL22 level in plasma was higher only in children with visible flexural eczema, which is one of AD diagnostic criteria but was judged on the same day of blood examination unlike other criteria. Here, we also developed an innovative method of machine learning for elucidating the complex cytokine/chemokine milieu related to symptoms of allergic diseases by using clustering analysis based on the random forest dissimilarity measure that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) technique. To our surprise, the majority of children showing at least any asthma-related symptoms during the last month were divided by AI into the two clusters, either cluster-2 having elevated levels of IL-33 (related to eosinophil activation) or cluster-3 having elevated levels of CXCL7/NAP2 (related to neutrophil activation), among the total three clusters. Future studies will clarify better approach for allergic diseases by endotype classification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Asthma; Atopic dermatitis; Child; Cohort study; Machine learning","chemokine; cutaneous T cell attracting chemokine; cytokine; macrophage derived chemokine; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; Article; artificial intelligence; asthma; atopic dermatitis; blood examination; child; clinical feature; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; eczema; exploratory research; female; human; leukocyte activation; machine learning; major clinical study; male; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor",,"thymus and activation regulated chemokine, 181532-29-6",,,"National Institute for Environmental Studies, NIES","The Japan Environment and Children's Study Pilot Study was funded by the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan.

Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of our handheld CRS system and propose a novel quantitative index to measure skin barrier function. Methods: This prospective study included 30 atopic dermatitis (AD) patients and 14 healthy volunteers. All AD participants were assessed using the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) severity instrument, a vapometer for trans-epidermal water loss and a moisture meter for skin surface moisture. A handheld CRS operating at 785 nm laser was used to measure the biochemical constituents of the skin up to a depth of ∼100 μm. We trained a linear kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) model for eczema classification based on the water, ceramide and urocanic acid content. A novel Eczema Biochemical Index (EBI) was then formulated using the skin constituents measured from the AD participants to stage disease severity. Results: The SVM model used to classify healthy participants and AD patients obtained high cross-validated area under the curve of 0.857 and accuracy of 0.841, with high sensitivity and specificity values of 0.857 and 0.833 respectively. EBI can be used to stratify AD patients of varying severity, based on the biochemical constituents in the skin. Conclusion: As compared to the standard CRS system, the handheld CRS offers higher portability and provides Raman measurements at various body regions with similar sensitivity. This suggests that a handheld CRS device could be a valuable point-of-care resource in both research and clinical use. © 2020 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology","Atopic dermatitis; Eczema; Imaging; Raman spectroscopy","adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; clinical article; cohort analysis; confocal Raman spectrometry; controlled study; disease classification; disease severity; eczema; Eczema Biochemical Index; feasibility study; female; human; male; priority journal; prospective study; quantitative analysis; Raman spectrometry; Scoring Atopic Dermatitis; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; skin function; skin surface; support vector machine; water loss",,,,,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR","Authors would like to thank B iomedical Research Council (BMRC) , A*STAR, Singapore for the intramural funding support for this study.

Although AD is considered a childhood disease, adult onset is possible, presenting with daily sleep disturbance and functional impairment associated with itch, neuropsychiatric issues (anxiety and depression), and reduced health-related quality of life. Although such aspects of adult AD disease burden have been measured through standardized assessments and based on population-level data, the understanding of the disease experienced at the patient level remains poor. This text-mining study assessed the impact of AD on the lives of adult patients as described from an experiential perspective. Methods: Natural language processing (NLP) was applied to qualitative patient response data from two large-scale international cross-sectional surveys conducted in the USA and countries outside of the USA (non-USA; Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK). Descriptive analysis was conducted on patient responses to an open-ended question on how they felt about their AD and how the disease affected their life. Character length, word count, and stop word (common words) count were evaluated; centrality analysis identified concepts that were most strongly interlinked. Results: Patients with AD in all countries were most frequently impacted by itch, pain, and embarrassment across all levels of disease severity. Patients with moderate-to-severe AD were more likely than patients with mild AD to describe sleep disturbances, fatigue, and feelings of depression, anxiety, and a lack of hope that were directly associated with AD. Centrality analysis revealed sleep disturbance was strongly linked with itch. Collectively, these concepts revealed that patients with AD are impacted by both physical and emotional burdens that are intricately connected. Conclusions: Qualitative data from NLP, being more patient-centric than data from clinical standardized measures, provide a more comprehensive view of the burden of AD to inform disease management. © 2020, The Author(s).","Atopic dermatitis; Natural language processing; Patient perception; Qualitative; Text-mining",,,,,,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals

Yet, the goal of developing actionable, robust, and reproducible predictive signatures of phenotypes such as clinical outcome has not been attained in almost any disease area. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis spanning prediction tasks from ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis, diabetes, to many cancer subtypes for a total of 24 binary and multiclass prediction problems and 26 survival analysis tasks. We systematically investigate the influence of gene subsets, normalization methods and prediction algorithms. Crucially, we also explore the novel use of deep representation learning methods on large transcriptomics compendia, such as GTEx and TCGA, to boost the performance of state-of-The-Art methods. The resources and findings in this work should serve as both an up-To-date reference on attainable performance, and as a benchmarking resource for further research. Results: Approaches that combine large numbers of genes outperformed single gene methods consistently and with a significant margin, but neither unsupervised nor semi-supervised representation learning techniques yielded consistent improvements in out-of-sample performance across datasets. Our findings suggest that using l 2-regularized regression methods applied to centered log-ratio transformed transcript abundances provide the best predictive analyses overall. Conclusions: Transcriptomics-based phenotype prediction benefits from proper normalization techniques and state-of-The-Art regularized regression approaches. In our view, breakthrough performance is likely contingent on factors which are independent of normalization and general modeling techniques; these factors might include reduction of systematic errors in sequencing data, incorporation of other data types such as single-cell sequencing and proteomics, and improved use of prior knowledge. © 2020 The Author(s).","Deep learning;

GWAS have identified loci underlying human diseases, but assigning the causal nucleotide changes still remain a controversial issue. Here we addressed these issues through the combination of high-density genotyping and epigenomic data using a random forest model to discover the noncoding causal variants. Focusing on autoimmune diseases, we triaged putative causal variants for atopic dermatitis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Making a filtering pipeline, we found three interesting single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1800630, rs1799964 and rs4796793) in the upstream site of TNF and STAT3 genes, two frequent genes shared in some autoimmune diseases, and show how those variants affect on TNF and STAT3 expression levels.

As a large amount of valuable clinical information is locked in clinical narratives, natural language processing techniques as an artificial intelligence approach have been leveraged to extract information from clinical narratives in electronic health records. This capability of natural language processing potentially enables automated chart review for identifying patients with distinctive clinical characteristics in clinical care and reduces methodological heterogeneity in defining phenotype, obscuring biological heterogeneity in research concerning allergy, asthma, and immunology.

Artificial intelligence is now being increasingly studied for its potential uses in medicine. A sound understanding of the concepts of this emerging field is essential for the dermatologist as dermatology has abundant medical data and images that can be used to train artificial intelligence for patient care. There are already a number of artificial intelligence studies focusing on skin disorders such as skin cancer, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and onychomycosis.

Insights into the diversity and frequency of transcripts in healthy and diseased conditions provide valuable information on the cellular status in the respective tissues. Growing with the technique, the bioinformatic analysis toolkit reveals biologically relevant pathways which assist in understanding basic pathophysiological mechanisms. Conventional classification systems of inflammatory skin diseases rely on descriptive assessments by pathologists. In contrast to this, molecular profiling may uncover previously unknown disease classifying features. Thereby, treatments and prognostics of patients may be improved. Furthermore, disease models in basic research in comparison to the human disease can be directly validated. The aim of this article is not only to provide the reader with information on the opportunities of these techniques, but to outline potential pitfalls and technical limitations as well. Major published findings are briefly discussed to provide a broad overview on the current findings in transcriptomics in inflammatory skin diseases. © 2020 by the authors.

AD severity is primarily evaluated based on visual inspections by clinicians, but is subjective and has large inter- and intra-observer variability in many clinical study settings. To aid the standardisation and automating the evaluation of AD severity, this paper introduces a CNN computer vision pipeline, EczemaNet, that first detects areas of AD from photographs and then makes probabilistic predictions on the severity of the disease. EczemaNet combines transfer and multitask learning, ordinal classification, and ensembling over crops to make its final predictions. We test EczemaNet using a set of images acquired in a published clinical trial, and demonstrate low RMSE with well-calibrated prediction intervals. We show the effectiveness of using CNNs for non-neoplastic dermatological diseases with a medium-size dataset, and their potential for more efficiently and objectively evaluating AD severity, which has greater clinical relevance than mere classification. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Eczema; Multitask; Uncertainty","Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; Dermatitis; Forecasting; Learning systems; Multi-task learning; Transfer learning; Atopic dermatitis; Calibrated prediction; Clinical trial; Dermatological disease; Intra-observer variability; Ordinal classification; Probabilistic prediction; Visual inspection; Medical imaging",,,,,,,,,"Abadi, M., TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning (2016) USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, pp. 265-283; Alam, M.N., Munia, T.T.K., Tavakolian, K., Vasefi, F., Mackinnon, N., Fazel-Rezai, R., Automatic detection and severity measurement of eczema using image processing (2016) EMBC, pp. 1365-1368. , IEEE; Ashukha, A., Lyzhov, A., Molchanov, D., Vetrov, D., Pitfalls of in-domain uncertainty estimation and ensembling in deep learning (2020) International Conference on Learning Representations; Berth-Jones, J., Six area, six sign atopic dermatitis (SASSAD) severity score: A simple system for monitoring disease activity in atopic dermatitis (1996) Br.

Transcriptomic analysis has advanced our understanding of gene expression in cells and tissues. However, molecular quantitation of cytokine transcripts does not predict the importance of a specific pathway in AD or cellular responses to different inflammatory stimuli. Objectives: To understand changes in keratinocyte transcriptomic programmes in human cutaneous disease during development of inflammation and in response to treatment. Methods: We performed in silico deconvolution of the whole-skin transcriptome. Using co-expression clustering and machine-learning tools, we resolved the gene expression of bulk skin (seven datasets, n = 406 samples), firstly, into keratinocyte phenotypes identified by unsupervised clustering and, secondly, into 19 cutaneous cell signatures of purified populations from publicly available datasets. Results: We identify three unique transcriptomic programmes in keratinocytes – KC1, KC2 and KC17 – characteristic of immune signalling from disease-associated Th cells. We cross-validate those signatures across different skin inflammatory conditions and disease stages and demonstrate that the keratinocyte response during treatment is therapy dependent. Broad-spectrum treatment with ciclosporin ameliorated the KC17 response in AD lesions to a nonlesional immunophenotype, without altering KC2. Conversely, the specific anti-Th2 therapy, dupilumab, reversed the KC2 immunophenotype. Conclusions: Our analysis of transcriptomic signatures in cutaneous disease biopsies reveals the effect of keratinocyte programming in skin inflammation and suggests that the perturbation of a single axis of immune signal alone may be insufficient to resolve keratinocyte immunophenotype abnormalities. © 2020 The Authors.

Methods: This crosssectional analysis used data from 655 participants in the OPPERA study. The authors investigated the individual and collective associations of five chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) with medically diagnosed atopic disorders and self-reported sleep disturbance, fatigue, and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. Atopic disorders were allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, urticaria, allergic conjunctivitis, and food allergy. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios as measures of association with temporomandibular disorders, headache, irritable bowel syndrome, low back pain, and fibromyalgia. Measures of sleep and atopy disorders were standardized to z scores to determinz e the relative strength of their associations with each COPC. Sociodemographic characteristics and body mass index were covariates. Random forest regression analyzed all variables simultaneously, computing importance metrics to determine which variables best differentiated pain cases from controls. Results: Fatigue and sleep disturbance were strongly associated with each COPC and with the total number of COPCs. An increase of one standard deviation in fatigue or sleep disturbance score was associated with approximately two-fold greater odds of having a COPC. In random forest models, atopic disorders contributed more than other health measures to differentiating between cases and controls of headache, whereas other COPCs were best differentiated by measures of fatigue or sleep. Conclusion: Atopic disorders, previously recognized as predictors of poor sleep, are associated with COPCs after accounting for sleep problems.

The delta-toxin (δ-toxin) of Staphylococcus aureus is the only hemolysin shown to cause mast cell degranulation and is linked to atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease. We sought to characterize variation in δ-toxin production across S. aureus strains and identify genetic loci potentially associated with differences between strains. Methods. A set of 124 S. aureus strains was genome-sequenced and δ-toxin levels in stationary phase supernatants determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). SNPs and kmers were associated with differences in toxin production using four genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods. Transposon mutations in candidate genes were tested for their δ-toxin levels. We constructed XGBoost models to predict toxin production based on genetic loci discovered to be potentially associated with the phenotype. Results. The S. aureus strain set encompassed 40 sequence types (STs) in 23 clonal complexes (CCs). δ-toxin production ranged from barely detectable levels to >90,000 units, with a median of >8,000 units. CC30 had significantly lower levels of toxin production than average while CC45 and CC121 were higher. MSSA (methicillin sensitive) strains had higher δ-toxin production than MRSA (methicillin resistant) strains. Through multiple GWAS approaches, 45 genes were found to be potentially associated with toxicity. Machine learning models using loci discovered through GWAS as features were able to predict δ-toxin production (as a high/low binary phenotype) with a precision of .875 and specificity of .990 but recall of .333. We discovered that mutants in the carA gene, encoding the small chain of carbamoyl phosphate synthase, completely abolished toxin production and toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Conclusions. The amount of stationary phase production of the toxin is a strain- specific phenotype likely affected by a complex interaction of number of genes with different levels of effect. We discovered new candidate genes that potentially play a role in modulating production. We report for the first time that the product of the carA gene is necessary for δ-toxin production in USA300. This work lays a foundation for future work on understanding toxin regulation in S. aureus and prediction of phenotypes from genomic sequences. © 2020 PeerJ Inc..

Different kinds of CNN architectures were implemented in various skin disease classification systems. In this paper, a skin disease classification for differentiating Atopic Dermatitis and Psoriasis Chronic Plaque using MobileNet architecture of Convolutional Neural Network was implemented in a Raspberry Pi. The MobileNet model was trained using the images selected from AtlasDerm, Danderm, DermIs, DermNet, DermQuest and DermatoWeb as the dataset. The network was tested using 30 captured images from patients using a Raspberry Pi camera which were verified by the Dermatologist. Confusion matrix was utilized to compute for the accuracy of the model between the two skin diseases. As a result, the system achieved an accuracy of 88% and 90% in classifying Atopic Dermatitis and Psoriasis Chronic Plaque, respectively. The use of MobileNet architecture of CNN allowed the high accuracy classification in differentiating skin diseases. © 2019 IEEE.","Atopic Dermatitis; Convolutional Neural Network; Depthwise Separable Convolution; MobileNet; Psoriasis Chronic Plaque","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Dermatology; Environmental management; Image recognition; Nanotechnology; Atopic dermatitis; Confusion matrices; High-accuracy; Skin disease; Network architecture",,,,,,,,,"Griffiths, C., Kerkhof, P., Czernacka-Operacz, M., Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (2017) Dermatol Ther (Heidelb), pp. 31-41; Leung, D.Y., Guttman-Yassky, E., Deciphering the complexities of atopic dermatitis: Shifting paradigms in treatment approaches J Allergy Clin Immunol, 134, pp. 769-779; Alam, M.N., Munia, T.T.K., Tavakolian, K., Vasefi, F., MacKinnon, N., Fazel-Rezai, R., Automatic detection and severity measurement of eczema using image processing (2016) 2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), pp. 1365-1368. , Orlando, FL; Pinson, R., Psoriasis in children Psoriasis (Auckland, N.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning could prove to be a good tool for assisting in the diagnosis of dermatological conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of data augmentation in machine learning image recognition of five dermatological disease manifestations—acne, atopic dermatitis, impetigo, psoriasis, and rosacea. Materials and Methods: Open-source dermatological images were gathered and used to retrain TensorFlow Inception version-3. Retraining was done twice—once with and once without data augmentation. Both models were tested with the same images, and R software was used to perform statistical analysis. Results: The average of each of the statistical measures (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPN, MCC, and F1 Score) increased when data augmentation was added to the model. In particular, the average Matthews correlation coefficient increased by 7.7%. Each of the five dermatological manifestations had an increase in area under the curve (AUC) after data augmentation with the average increase in AUC of 0.132 and a standard deviation of 0.033. Atopic dermatitis had the highest increase in AUC of 0.18. With data augmentation, the lowest AUC was 0.87 for psoriasis and the highest was 0.97 for acne, indicating that the model performs well. Conclusion: With a deep learning-based approach, it is possible to differentiate dermatological images with appreciable MCC, F1 score, and AUC. Further, data augmentation can be used to increase the model's accuracy by a significant amount. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A total of 30 participants were present at the meeting, including those from 17 SSA countries, representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Foundation for Dermatology (IFD) (a committee of the International League of Dermatological Societies, ILDS www.ilds.org), the Fondation pour la Dermatite Atopique, as well as specialists in telemedicine, artificial intelligence and therapeutic patient education (TPE). Results: AD is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory skin diseases in SSA. Besides neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) with a dermatological presentation, AD requires closer attention from the WHO and national Departments of Health. Conclusions: A roadmap has been defined with top priorities such as access to essential medicines and devices for AD care, in particular emollients, better education of primary healthcare workers for adequate triage (e.g. better educational materials for skin diseases in pigmented skin generally and AD in particular, especially targeted to Africa), involvement of traditional healers and to a certain extent also patient education, bearing in mind the barriers to effective healthcare faced in SSA countries such as travel distances to health facilities, limited resources and the lack of dermatological expertise. In addition, several initiatives concerning AD research in SSA were discussed and should be implemented in close collaboration with the WHO and assessed at follow-up meetings, in particular, at the next ISAD meeting in Seoul, South Korea and African Society of Dermatology and Venereology (ASDV) meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, both in 2020. © 2019 The Authors.

Early detection and treatment are key to a quick recovery. An automated system to identify skin diseases can act as a tool to assist doctors and healthcare workers. This paper presents an intelligent system to segment and classify three common skin diseases in Sri Lanka-tinea versicolor, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis-using image processing, genetic algorithm and machine learning. YUV-based color segmentation was applied to extract the affected region, then the texture and color features were extracted for classification.

Clinical features of AD vary by age, duration, and severity but can include papules, vesicles, erythema, exudate, xerosis, scaling, and lichenification. However, the most defining and universal symptom of AD is pruritus. Pruritus or itch, defined as an unpleasant urge to scratch, is problematic for many reasons, particularly its negative impact on quality of life. Despite the profoundly negative impact of pruritus on patients with AD, clinicians and researchers lack standardized and validated methods to objectively measure pruritus. The purpose of this review is to discuss emerging methods to assess pruritus in AD by describing objective patient-centered tools developed or enhanced over the last decade that can be utilized by clinicians and researchers alike. Methods: This review is based on a literature search in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The search was performed in February 2019. The keywords were used “pruritus,” “itch,” “atopic dermatitis,” “eczema,” “measurements,” “tools,” “instruments,” “accelerometer,” “wrist actigraphy,” “smartwatch,” “transducer,” “vibration,” “brain mapping,” “magnetic resonance imaging,” and “positron emission tomography.” Only articles written in English were included, and no restrictions were set on study type. To focus on emerging methods, prioritization was given to results from the last decade (2009–2019). Results: The search yielded 49 results in PubMed, 134 results in Embase, and 85 results in Web of Science. Each result was independently reviewed in a standardized manner by two of the authors (M.S., K.L.), and disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus. Relevant findings were categorized into the following sections: video surveillance, acoustic surveillance, wrist actigraphy, smart devices, vibration transducers, and neurological imaging. Examples are provided along with descriptions of how each technology works, instances of use in research or clinical practice, and as applicable, reports of validation studies and correlation with other methods. Conclusion: The variety of new and improved methods to evaluate pruritus in AD is welcomed by clinicians, researchers, and patients alike. Future directions include next-generation smart devices as well as exploring new territories, such as identifying biomarkers that correlate to itch and machine-learning programs to identify itch processing in the brain. As these efforts continue, it will be essential to remain patient-centered by developing techniques that minimize discomfort, respect privacy, and provide accurate data that can be used to better manage itch in AD. © 2019, The Author(s).","Atopic dermatitis; Diagnosis; Eczema; Itch; Pruritus","acoustics; actimetry; atopic dermatitis; brain mapping; clinical feature; clinical practice; disease severity; disease surveillance; eczema; erythema; exudate; human; lichenoid eruption; neuroimaging; papule; positron emission tomography; priority journal; pruritus; Review; skin disease assessment; systematic review; vibration; videorecording; wrist actigraphy; xerosis",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: U01AI119125

Accurate and reliable decision-making by a dermatologist are needed for better therapy and risk stratification to the patient. Generally, the dermatologist used visual assessment to make decisions of the severity score. The procedure is very subjective and carries a lack of reliability. The paper presents a novel approach to classify the atopic dermatitis severity scoring based on machine learning algorithms using color, texture, and redness features of the skin. The redness features showed significant indication compared to other features. The overall accuracy achieved by the Multi-class SVM classifier was around 86%, and the multiclass SVM successfully classified the severity score into four classes. © 2019 IEEE.","Atopic dermatitis disease; Dermatology; Machine learning; Multi-class classifier","Decision making; Dermatology; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Patient treatment; Textures; Atopic dermatitis; Disease severity; Multi-class classifier; Multiclass SVM; Overall accuracies; Risk stratification; Skin disease; Visual assessments; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,,"Yew, Y.W., Thyssen, J.P., Silverberg, J.I., A systematic review and meta-analysis of the regional and age-related differences in atopic dermatitis clinical characteristics (2019) J.

Dermatology sicknesses incorporates normal skin rashes to serious skin contaminations, which happens because of scope of things, like diseases, warm, allergens, framework issue and drugs. First regular skin issue are dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis is relating current (perpetual) condition that causes eager, aroused skin. Most much of the time it appears as patches on the face, neck, trunk or appendages. It will in general erupt sporadically so die down for a period. A large portion of the dermatological sicknesses are not reparable but rather most the treatments depend on the administration of the side effects related with it. The focus of this research will be the Dermatology database. The problem is to determine the type of Eryhemato-Squamous disease like psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis and pityriasis rubra pilaris. The differential analysis of erythemato-squamous maladies is a genuine issue in dermatology. They all offer the clinical highlights of erythema and scaling, with next to no distinctions. Each pattern is a set of 33 numbers in the range linear values and one of them is nominal. The 80% of the dataset utilize for demonstrating and keep down 20% for approval. Objective is to accomplish best performer algorithm which will convey in dermatology informational collection so for this reason the gut feel recommends distance based calculations like k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines may progress admirably.

Single-cell RNA-sequencing study (scRNA-seq) allows the characterization of such complex changes in whole organs. Methods: The study is based on applying network tools to organize and analyze scRNA-seq data from a mouse model of arthritis and human rheumatoid arthritis, in order to find diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Diagnostic validation studies were performed using expression profiling data and potential protein biomarkers from prospective clinical studies of 13 diseases. A candidate drug was examined by a treatment study of a mouse model of arthritis, using phenotypic, immunohistochemical, and cellular analyses as read-outs. Results: We performed the first systematic analysis of pathways, potential biomarkers, and drug targets in scRNA-seq data from a complex disease, starting with inflamed joints and lymph nodes from a mouse model of arthritis. We found the involvement of hundreds of pathways, biomarkers, and drug targets that differed greatly between cell types. Analyses of scRNA-seq and GWAS data from human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) supported a similar dispersion of pathogenic mechanisms in different cell types. Thus, systems-level approaches to prioritize biomarkers and drugs are needed. Here, we present a prioritization strategy that is based on constructing network models of disease-associated cell types and interactions using scRNA-seq data from our mouse model of arthritis, as well as human RA, which we term multicellular disease models (MCDMs). We find that the network centrality of MCDM cell types correlates with the enrichment of genes harboring genetic variants associated with RA and thus could potentially be used to prioritize cell types and genes for diagnostics and therapeutics. We validated this hypothesis in a large-scale study of patients with 13 different autoimmune, allergic, infectious, malignant, endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as a therapeutic study of the mouse arthritis model. Conclusions: Overall, our results support that our strategy has the potential to help prioritize diagnostic and therapeutic targets in human disease. © 2019 The Author(s).","Biomarker and drug discovery; Network tools; scRNA-seq","bezafibrate; RNA; biological marker; allergic rhinitis; arthritis; Article; asthma; atherosclerosis; atopic dermatitis; breast cancer; cells by body anatomy; chronic lymphatic leukemia; colorectal cancer; controlled study; correlation analysis; Crohn disease; disease marker; disease model; drug targeting; gene expression profiling; genome-wide association study; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; influenza A; influenza B; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; lymphadenopathy; major clinical study; obesity; phenotype; priority journal; psoriasis; rheumatoid arthritis; RNA sequence; single cell analysis; tonsillitis; ulcerative colitis; animal; biology; disease predisposition; drug development; genomics; high throughput sequencing; molecular diagnosis; mouse; multifactorial inheritance; procedures; reproducibility; rheumatoid arthritis; Animals; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Biomarkers; Computational Biology; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Susceptibility; Drug Discovery; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Mice; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Multifactorial Inheritance; Neural Networks, Computer; Reproducibility of Results; Single-Cell Analysis",,"bezafibrate, 41859-67-0; RNA, 63231-63-0; Biomarkers",,"Sigma Aldrich","National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: DP2GM119419

Objective: We sought to determine whether food-specific (sIgE) or component immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels could predict allergic status in patients with moderate to severe AD and elevated total IgE. Methods: Seventy-eight children (median age, 10.7 years) with moderate to severe AD were assessed for a history of clinical reactivity to milk, egg, peanut, wheat, and soy. The IgE levels for each food and its components were determined by ImmunoCAP. The level and pattern of IgE reactivity to each food and its components, and their ratio to total IgE, were compared between subjects who were allergic and tolerant to each food. Results: Ninety-one percent of subjects were sensitized, and 51% reported allergic reactivity to at least 1 of the 5 most common food allergens. Allergy to milk, egg, and peanut were most common, and IgE levels to each of these foods were significantly higher in the allergic group. Component IgEs most associated with milk, egg, and peanut allergy were Bos d8, Gal d1, and Ara h2, respectively. The ratio of sIgE to total IgE offered no advantage to sIgE alone in predicting allergy. Conclusion: Specific IgE levels and the pattern of IgE reactivity to food components can distinguish AD subjects allergic vs tolerant to the major food allergens and may therefore be helpful in guiding the clinical management of these patients. © 2019",,"immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E; adolescent; allergic reaction; Article; atopic dermatitis; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; decision tree; disease severity; egg allergy; female; food allergy; human; immunoglobulin blood level; major clinical study; male; milk allergy; peanut allergy; predictive value; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; soybean; wheat allergy; adult; adverse event; animal; Arachis; atopic dermatitis; blood; egg; food allergy; immunology; milk; preschool child; severity of illness index; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Arachis; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Eggs; Female; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Male; Milk; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Immunoglobulin E","ImmunoCAP",,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

Drug repurposing (or repositioning) is a cost-effective approach for finding drugs that can be used to treat diseases for which they are currently not prescribed. We implemented an efficient bioinformatics approach using word embedding to summarize drug information from more than 20 million articles and applied machine learning to model the drug-disease relationship. We trained our drug repurposing approach separately on nine cutaneous diseases (including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and alopecia areata) and eight other immune-mediated diseases and obtained a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.93 in cross-validation. Focusing in particular on psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory condition of skin that affects more than 100 million people worldwide, we were able to confirm drugs that are known to be effective for psoriasis and to identify potential candidates used to treat other diseases. Furthermore, the targets of drug candidates predicted by our approach were significantly enriched among genes differentially expressed in psoriatic lesional skin from a large-scale RNA sequencing cohort. Although our algorithm cannot be used to determine clinical efficacy, our work provides an approach for suggesting drugs for repurposing to immune-mediated cutaneous diseases. © 2018 The Authors",,"balsalazide; bimatoprost; budesonide; cyclophosphamide; dexamethasone; gamma interferon; glatiramer; hydrocortisone; hydroxychloroquine; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 4; latanoprost; leflunomide; mercaptopurine; mesalazine; methylprednisolone; prednisone; triamcinolone; transcriptome; alopecia; alopecia areata; Article; atopic dermatitis; autoimmune disease; bioinformatics; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell infiltration; cohort analysis; drug induced disease; drug information; drug repositioning; false positive result; gene expression; human; immunocompetent cell; inflammatory cell; learning algorithm; machine learning; multiple sclerosis; prediction; priority journal; psoriasis; RNA sequence; semantics; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; upregulation; word embedding based machine learning; workflow; algorithm; biology; drug effect; drug repositioning; immunology; immunopathology; Medline; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; skin; skin disease; Algorithms; Cohort Studies; Computational Biology; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Immune System Diseases; Machine Learning; PubMed; ROC Curve; Skin; Skin Diseases; Transcriptome",,"balsalazide, 82101-18-6; bimatoprost, 155206-00-1; budesonide, 51333-22-3, 51372-29-3; cyclophosphamide, 50-18-0; dexamethasone, 50-02-2; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; glatiramer, 147245-92-9, 28704-27-0; hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; inducible nitric oxide synthase, 501433-35-8; latanoprost, 130209-82-4; leflunomide, 75706-12-6; mercaptopurine, 31441-78-8, 50-44-2, 6112-76-1; mesalazine, 89-57-6; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; prednisone, 53-03-2; triamcinolone, 124-94-7",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

There are several different chronic inflammatory skin diseases that can present similar clinical and dermoscopy features to psoriasis vulgaris, making accurate diagnosis more difficult. Both literature-based and data-driven selection of biomarker was conducted to select candidates for a multicomponent biomarker for psoriasis vulgaris. Support vector machine-based classification models were trained using gene expression data from locally recruited patients and validated on 7 public datasets, which included gene expression data of other inflammatory skin diseases in addition to psoriasis vulgaris. The resulting accuracy of the best classification model based on the expression levels of 4 genes (IL36G, CCL27, NOS2 and C10orf99) was 96.4%, outperforming classification based on other marker gene combinations, which were more affected by variability in gene expression profiles between different datasets and patient groups. This approach has the potential to fill the void of clinically applicable diagnostic biomarkers for psoriasis vulgaris and other inflammatory skin diseases. © 2019 Acta Dermato-Venereologica.","Psoriasis; Support vector machine; Transcriptome","biological marker; c10orf99 protein; cutaneous T cell attracting chemokine; il36g protein; inducible nitric oxide synthase; transcriptome; unclassified drug; biological marker; transcriptome; Article; atopic dermatitis; clinical article; contact dermatitis; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; disease severity; down regulation; epiluminescence microscopy; gene expression level; gene expression profiling; human; lichen planus; marker gene; priority journal; psoriasis vulgaris; pustulosis palmoplantaris; random forest; real time polymerase chain reaction; receiver operating characteristic; recursive feature elimination; RNA sequence; scalp psoriasis; support vector machine; transcriptomics; upregulation; cohort analysis; comparative study; factual database; female; genetics; immunohistochemistry; male; needle biopsy; procedures; psoriasis; sensitivity and specificity; severity of illness index; university hospital; Biomarkers; Biopsy, Needle; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Psoriasis; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index; Support Vector Machine; Transcriptome",,"inducible nitric oxide synthase, 501433-35-8; Biomarkers",,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 668989, PUT1465

Therapeutic options for AD remain limited, in part because of a lack of well-characterized animal models. There has been increasing interest in developing experimental approaches to study the pathogenesis of human AD in vivo, in vitro, and in silico to better define pathophysiologic mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers that predict therapeutic response. This review critically appraises a range of models, including genetic mutations relevant to AD, experimental challenge of human skin in vivo, tissue culture models, integration of “omics” data sets, and development of predictive computational models. Although no one individual model recapitulates the complex AD pathophysiology, our review highlights insights gained into key elements of cutaneous biology, molecular pathways, and therapeutic target identification through each approach. Recent developments in computational analysis, including application of machine learning and a systems approach to data integration and predictive modeling, highlight the applicability of these methods to AD subclassification (endotyping), therapy development, and precision medicine. Such predictive modeling will highlight knowledge gaps, further inform refinement of biological models, and support new experimental and systems approaches to AD. © 2018 The Authors","Atopic dermatitis; atopic eczema; endotype; human models; machine learning; mechanistic models; precision medicine; skin equivalents; systems biology; tissue culture models","Article; atopic dermatitis; computer model; gene mutation; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; mathematical model; nonhuman; priority journal; tissue culture; atopic dermatitis; biological model; computer simulation; genetics; immunology; pathology; personalized medicine; skin; biological marker; Biomarkers; Computer Simulation; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Models, Immunological; Precision Medicine; Skin",,"Biomarkers",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

About 85% of AD cases begin in childhood, a significant portion of which can persist into adulthood. Moreover, a typical progression of children with AD to food allergy, asthma or allergic rhinitis has been reported (“allergic march” or “atopic march”). AD comprises highly heterogeneous sub-phenotypes/endotypes resulting from complex interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as environmental stimuli, and genetic factors regulating cutaneous functions (impaired barrier function, epidermal lipid, and protease abnormalities), immune functions and the microbiome. Though the roles of high-throughput “omics” integrations in defining endotypes are recognized, current analyses are primarily based on individual omics data and using binary clinical outcomes. Although individual omics analysis, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), can effectively map variants correlated with AD, the majority of the heritability and the functional relevance of discovered variants are not explained or known by the identified variants. The limited success of singular approaches underscores the need for holistic and integrated approaches to investigate complex phenotypes using trans-omics data integration strategies. Integrating omics layers (e.g., genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, lipidome, exposome, microbiome), which often have complementary and synergistic effects, might provide the opportunity to capture the flow of information underlying AD disease manifestation. Overlapping genes/candidates derived from multiple omics types include FLG, SPINK5, S100A8, and SERPINB3 in AD pathogenesis. Overlapping pathways include macrophage, endothelial cell and fibroblast activation pathways, in addition to well-known Th1/Th2 and NFkB activation pathways. Interestingly, there was more multi-omics overlap at the pathway level than gene level. Further analysis of multi-omics overlap at the tissue level showed that among 30 tissue types from the GTEx database, skin and esophagus were significantly enriched, indicating the biological interconnection between AD and food allergy. The present work explores multi-omics integration and provides new biological insights to better define the biological basis of AD etiology and confirm previously reported AD genes/pathways. In this context, we also discuss opportunities and challenges introduced by “big omics data” and their integration. © 2018 Ghosh, Bernstein, Khurana Hershey, Rothenberg and Mersha.","Atopic dermatitis; Bioinformatics; Biomarkers; Endotypes; Machine learning; Multi-omics integration; Network analysis; Omics","lipidome; proteinase; proteome; skin lipid; transcriptome; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; bioinformatics; clinical outcome; disease exacerbation; epigenetics; epigenome; exposome; exposomics; food allergy; genetic analysis; genome; genome-wide association study; genomics; heredity; high throughput sequencing; human; immune response; lipidomics; macrophage; metabolome; metabolomics; microbiome; microbiomics; multiomics; nonhuman; omics; overlapping gene; personalized medicine; phenotype; proteomics; synergistic effect; transcriptomics; animal; atopic dermatitis; genetics; genome-wide association study; immunology; metabolism; pathology; procedures; Animals; Dermatitis, Atopic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; Metabolomics; Precision Medicine",,"proteinase, 9001-92-7",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: R01HL132344

A method for objectively quantifying nocturnal scratching events could aid in the development of therapies for atopic dermatitis and other pruritic disorders. High-resolution wrist actigraphy (three-dimensional accelerometer sensors sampled at ≥20 Hz) is a noninvasive method to record movement. This paper presents an algorithm to detect nocturnal scratching events based on actigraphy data. The twofold process consists of segmenting the data into 'no motion,' 'single handed motion,' and 'both handed motion' followed by discriminating motion segments into scratching and other motion using a bidirectional recurrent neural network classifier. The performance was compared against manually scored infrared video data collected from 24 subjects (6 healthy controls and 18 atopic dermatitis patients) demonstrating an F1 score of 0.68 and a rank correlation of 0.945. The algorithm clearly outperformed a published reference method based on wrist actigraphy ( F1 score of 0.09 and a rank correlation of 0.466). The results suggest that scratching movements can be discriminated from other nocturnal movements accurately. © 2013 IEEE.","Accelerometers; actigraphy; atopic dermatitis; long short-term memory; pruritus; recurrent neural networks; scratch","Accelerometers; Dermatitis; Long short-term memory; Noninvasive medical procedures; Patient monitoring; Accelerometer sensor; Actigraphy; Atopic dermatitis; Bidirectional recurrent neural networks; Chronic inflammatory; Noninvasive methods; pruritus; scratch; Recurrent neural networks; actimetry; adult; algorithm; Article; atopic dermatitis; classifier; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; female; human; male; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; motion; non invasive procedure; recurrent neural network; scratching; skin pruritus; accelerometry; artificial neural network; atopic dermatitis; complication; middle aged; procedures; pruritus; signal processing; young adult; Accelerometry; Actigraphy; Adult; Algorithms; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks (Computer); Pruritus; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Young Adult",,,"GeneActiv",,,"Manuscript received May 17, 2016; revised December 6, 2016, March 31, 2017, and May 16, 2017; accepted May 24, 2017.

Biomarker studies frequently follow a case-control set-up in which patients diagnosed with a disease are compared to controls. Longitudinal cohort studies such as the COPD-centered German COPD and SYstemic consequences-COmorbidities NETwork (COSYCONET) study provide the patient and biomaterial base for discovering predictive molecular markers. We asked whether microRNA (miRNA) profiles in blood collected from COPD patients prior to a tumor diagnosis could support an early diagnosis of tumor development independent of the tumor type. From 2741 participants of COSYCONET diagnosed with COPD, we selected 534 individuals including 33 patients who developed cancer during the follow-up period of 54 months and 501 patients who did not develop cancer, but had similar age, gender and smoking history. Genome-wide miRNA profiles were generated and evaluated using machine learning techniques. For patients developing cancer we identified nine miRNAs with significantly decreased abundance (two-tailed unpaired t-test adjusted for multiple testing P &lt; 0.05), including members of the miR-320 family. The identified miRNAs regulate different cancer-related pathways including the MAPK pathway (P = 2.3 × 10−5). We also observed the impact of confounding factors on the generated miRNA profiles, underlining the value of our matched analysis. For selected miRNAs, qRT-PCR analysis was applied to validate the results. In conclusion, we identified several miRNAs in blood of COPD patients, which could serve as candidates for biomarkers to help identify COPD patients at risk of developing cancer. © 2018","Biomarker; Cancer; COPD; COSYCONET; Lung; microRNA","biological marker; microRNA; microRNA 320c; microRNA 320e; microRNA 4695 3p; microRNA 4785; microRNA 517a 3p; microRNA 519d 3p; microRNA 548ay 5p; microRNA 548d 5p; microRNA 7109 3p; mitogen activated protein kinase; tumor marker; unclassified drug; microRNA; tumor marker; age; aged; apoptosis; Article; atopic dermatitis; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; chronic obstructive lung disease; chronic vein insufficiency; cohort analysis; comorbidity; down regulation; early cancer diagnosis; female; follow up; gender; gene expression profiling; gene function; genome-wide association study; human; longitudinal study; lung cancer; lung function; machine learning; major clinical study; male; MAPK signaling; microarray analysis; multicenter study; multigene family; observational study; oxygen therapy; predictive value; prospective study; quantitative analysis; receiver operating characteristic; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sarcoidosis; smoking habit; upregulation; chronic obstructive lung disease; complication; genetics; human genome; neoplasm; prognosis; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cohort Studies; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome, Human; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; Prognosis; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",,"mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5; Biomarkers, Tumor; MicroRNAs",,,"Pfizer

The aim of this study was to reassess histopathology and immunophenotyping properties to distinguish between ACD, ICD, and AD. Charts of patients with eczema, who had undergone complete routine diagnostic workup (skin biopsies, patch tests, skin prick tests, and respectively or serum IgE levels), were reviewed. Thirty-five skin biopsy specimens of 28 patients (mean age 64 6 15 years; = 13 = 15) with clear diagnosis of ACD (n = 15), ICD (n = 6), or AD (n = 14) were analyzed. Histomorphological and immunohistochemical (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11c, CD34, CD123, S100, and IL-17) parameters were evaluated using Kruskal–Wallis test, Wilcoxon test, Fisher exact test, and decision tree analysis. Eosinophils were statistically significant (P = 0.0184), more often observed in AD than in ACD or ICD. No other statistically significant differences were found with regard to epidermal patterns, patterns of dermal infiltrates, or immunophenotyping. Using predictive modeling approaches, dermal eosinophils were found to be associated with AD, necrotic epidermal keratinocytes with ICD, and a focal type of parakeratosis with ACD. As an additional finding, pseudo-Pautrier microabscesses, which were present in the skin of 2 AD and 2 ACD patients, contained myeloid dendritic cells (CD11c+). Differentiation of ACD, ICD, and AD should be based on clinical features and results of allergy tests. Histopathology does not reliably differentiate between ACD, ICD, and AD, but helps to exclude psoriasis, tinea, or T-cell lymphoma. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods: A systematic search of the following online databases was performed: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, EconLit, Scopus, Health Technology Assessment, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and Web of Science. Papers were eligible for inclusion if they described a decision–analytic model evaluating both the costs and benefits associated with an intervention or prevention for atopic eczema. Data were extracted using a standardised form by two independent reviewers, whilst quality was assessed using the model-specific Philips criteria. Results: Twenty-four models were identified, evaluating either preventions (n = 12) or interventions (n = 12): 14 reported using a Markov modelling approach, four utilised decision trees and one a discrete event simulation, whilst five did not specify the approach. The majority, 22 studies, reported that the intervention was dominant or cost effective, given the assumptions and analytical perspective taken. Notably, the models tended to be short-term (16 used a time horizon of ≤1 year), often providing little justification for the limited time horizon chosen. The methodological and reporting quality of the studies was generally weak, with only seven studies fulfilling more than 50% of their applicable Philips criteria. Conclusions: This is the first systematic review of decision models in eczema. Whilst the majority of models reported favourable outcomes in terms of the cost effectiveness of the new intervention, the usefulness of these findings for decision-making is questionable. In particular, there is considerable scope for increasing the range of interventions evaluated, for improving modelling structures and reporting quality. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"atopic dermatitis; Cinahl; Cochrane Library; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; decision tree; economic evaluation; Embase; human; Markov chain; Medline; practice guideline; priority journal; quality control; Review; Scopus; systematic review; Web of Science; atopic dermatitis; cost benefit analysis; decision support system; economic model; economics; time factor; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Support Techniques; Decision Trees; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Markov Chains; Models, Economic; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Time Factors",,,,,"National Institute for Health Research, NIHR","Funding This work was funded as part of Professor Tracey Sach’s Career Development Fellowship (CDF award-2014-07-006) supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).

The microbiota associated to the human breast milk contributes to create the ""initial"" intestinal microbiota of infants, having also a pivotal role in modulating and influencing the newborns' immune system. Indeed, the transient gut microbiota is responsible for the initial change from an intrauterine Th2 prevailing response to a Th1/Th2 balanced one. Bacteria located in both colostrum and mature milk can stimulate the anti-inflammatory response, by stimulating the production of specific cytokines, reducing the risk of developing a broad range of inflammatory diseases and preventing the expression of immune-mediated pathologies, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. The aim of the present Mini Review is to elucidate the specific immunologic role of the human milk-associated microbiota and its impact on the newborn's health and life, highlighting the importance to properly study the biological interactions in a bacterial population and between the microbiota and the host. The Auto Contractive Map, for instance, is a promising analytical methodology based on artificial neural network that can elucidate the specific role of bacteria contained in the breast milk in modulating the infants' immunological response. © 2017 Toscano, De Grandi, Grossi and Drago.

Using a matched case control design with 3911 ASD cases and 38,609 controls, we found that 38 out of 79 medical conditions were associated with increased ASD risk. Developmental delay, mental health, and neurology conditions had the strongest associations (ORs 2.0–23.3). Moderately strong associations were observed for nutrition, genetic, ear nose and throat, and sleep conditions (ORs 2.1–3.2). Using machine learning methods, we clustered children based on their medical conditions prior to ASD diagnosis and demonstrated ASD risk stratification. Our findings provide new evidence indicating that children with ASD have a disproportionate burden of certain medical conditions preceding ASD diagnosis. © 2017, The Author(s).","Autism spectrum disorder; Comorbidity; Medical conditions","accidental injury; adjustment disorder; allergic rhinitis; anemia; anxiety disorder; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; attention deficit disorder; autism; autoimmune disease; bacterial infection; cardiovascular disease; case control study; central nervous system disease; cerebral palsy; child; childhood disease; childhood injury; childhood obesity; cognitive defect; conjunctivitis; constipation; contact dermatitis; controlled study; degenerative disease; depression; developmental delay; diarrhea; disease association; disorders of acid base balance; drug hypersensitivity; ear infection; ear nose throat disease; eczema; electrolyte disturbance; endocrine disease; epilepsy; esophagus disease; eye infection; face malformation; female; female genital tract infection; food allergy; fracture; functional disease; gastroesophageal reflux; gastrointestinal infection; gastrointestinal motility disorder; genetic disorder; head and neck injury; headache; hematologic malignancy; human; hyperalimentation; impulse control disorder; inflammatory bowel disease; intoxication; kidney disease; language delay; learning disorder; lower respiratory tract infection; lung disease; major clinical study; male; motor dysfunction; musculoskeletal disease; mycosis; nervous system malformation; neurologic disease; nutritional disorder; peripheral neuropathy; preschool child; priority journal; school child; skin infection; skull malformation; sleep disorder; sleep disordered breathing; Stevens Johnson syndrome; tic; upper respiratory tract infection; urogenital tract infection; urticaria; virus infection; autism; child health; developmental disorder; mental health; risk; statistics and numerical data; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Developmental Disabilities; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Risk",,,,,,,,,"Agresti, A., Kateri, M., (2011) Categorical data analysis, , Springer, Berlin Heidelberg; (2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5), , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Atladottir, H.O., Thorsen, P., Schendel, D.E., Ostergaard, L., Lemcke, S., Parner, E.T., Association of hospitalization for infection in childhood with diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders: A Danish cohort study (2010) Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, 164 (5), pp. 470-477; Bauman, M.L., Medical comorbidities in autism: challenges to diagnosis and treatment (2010) Neurotherapeutics: The Journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, 7 (3), pp. 320-327; Black, C., Kaye, J.A., Jick, H., Relation of childhood gastrointestinal disorders to autism: Nested case-control study using data from the UK general practice research database (2002) Bmj, 325 (7361), pp. 419-421. , PID: 12193358; Blumberg, S.J., Bramlett, M.D., Kogan, M.D., Schieve, L.A., Jones, J.R., Lu, M.C., Changes in prevalence of parent-reported autism spectrum disorder in school-aged U.S. children: 2007 to 2011–2012 (2013) National Health Statistics Reports, 65, pp. 1-11; Brennan, L., Barton, M., Chen, C.M., Green, J., Fein, D., Detecting subgroups in children diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (2015) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 45 (5), pp. 1329-1344. , PID: 25374133; Buie, T., Campbell, D.B., Fuchs, G.J., 3rd, Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders in individuals with ASDs: A consensus report (2010) Pediatrics, 125, pp. S1-S18. , PID: 20048083; Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders—autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network, United States, 2006.

These adjacent regions show one of the most contrasting socio-economical differences in the world. Objective: We explored changes in allergy from school age to young adulthood from 2003 to 2010/2012 in these two areas. The skin and nasal microbiota were also compared. Methods: Randomly selected children from Finnish (n = 98) and Russian Karelia (n = 82) were examined in 2003, when the children were 7–11 years of age, and again in 2010 (Finnish Karelia) and 2012 (Russian Karelia). We analysed self-reported allergy symptoms and sensitization to common allergens by serum sIgE values. The skin (volar forearm) and nasal mucosa microbiota, collected in 2012 (aged 15–20 years), identified from DNA samples, were compared with multivariate methods. Results: Asthma, hay fever, atopic eczema, self-reported rhinitis, as well as atopic sensitization, were threefold to 10-fold more common in Finland, as compared to Russian Karelia. Hay fever and peanut sensitization were almost non-existent in Russia. These patterns remained throughout the 10-year follow-up. Skin microbiota, as well as bacterial and fungal communities in nasal mucosa, was contrastingly different between the populations, best characterized by the diversity and abundance of genus Acinetobacter; more abundant and diverse in Russia. Overall, diversity was significantly higher among Russian subjects (Pskin &lt; 0.0001, Pnasal-bacteria &lt; 0.0001 and Pnasal-fungi &lt; 0.01). Allergic diseases were not associated with microbial diversity in Finnish subjects. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Differences in allergic phenotype, developed in early life, remain between populations. A parallel difference in the composition of skin and nasal microbiota suggests a potential underlying mechanism. Our results also suggest that high abundance and diversity of Acinetobacter might contribute to the low allergy prevalence in Russia. Implications of early-life exposure to Acinetobacter should be further investigated. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","allergy; Finland; microbiota; Russia; specific IgE","DNA; egg white; food allergen; immunoglobulin E; Acinetobacter; Acinetobacter johnsonii; Acinetobacter lwoffii; adolescent; adult; Aerococcus; Artemisia vulgaris; Article; Aspergillus; asthma; atopic dermatitis; bacterium; birch; cat; child; Cladosporium herbarum; controlled study; Corynebacterium; Dermatophagoides; dog; female; Finland; fish; follow up; forearm; fungal community; fungal flora; health disparity; horse; human; Jeotgalicoccus; major clinical study; male; microbial community; microbial diversity; Micrococcus; Micrococcus flavus; Micrococcus luteus; milk; nose epithelium; nose mucosa; peanut; Phleum pratense; Phoma; pollen allergy; prevalence; priority journal; random forest; Republic of Karelia; rhinitis; school child; sensitization; skin flora; soybean; wheat; Acinetobacter; clinical trial; hypersensitivity; microbiology; microflora; multicenter study; nose cavity; randomized controlled trial; Russian Federation; skin; Acinetobacter; Child; Female; Finland; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Male; Microbiota; Nasal Cavity; Prevalence; Russia; Skin",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; egg white, 9006-50-2; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,"Academy of Finland

Martino, School and Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Messina, Italy","Background: Early recognition of inflammatory markers and their relation to asthma, adverse drug reactions, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases is an important goal in allergy. The vast majority of studies in the literature are based on classic statistical methods; however, developments in computational techniques such as soft computing-based approaches hold new promise in this field. Objective: The aim of this manuscript is to systematically review the main soft computing-based techniques such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, bayesian networks and fuzzy logic to investigate their performances in the field of allergic diseases. Methods: The review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and the protocol was registered within PROSPERO database (CRD42016038894). The research was performed on PubMed and ScienceDirect, covering the period starting from September 1, 1990 through April 19, 2016. Results: The review included 27 studies related to allergic diseases and soft computing performances. We observed promising results with an overall accuracy of 86.5%, mainly focused on asthmatic disease. The review reveals that soft computing-based approaches are suitable for big data analysis and can be very powerful, especially when dealing with uncertainty and poorly characterized parameters. Furthermore, they can provide valuable support in case of lack of data and entangled cause-effect relationships, which make it difficult to assess the evolution of disease. Conclusions: Although most works deal with asthma, we believe the soft computing approach could be a real breakthrough and foster new insights into other allergic diseases as well. © 2017 The Author(s).","Allergy; Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural networks; Asthma; Fuzzy logic","carboplatin; complement component C1s inhibitor; dexamethasone; docetaxel; oxaliplatin; paclitaxel; allergic asthma; allergic conjunctivitis; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; Article; artificial neural network; atopic dermatitis; Bayesian learning; fuzzy logic; human; hypersensitivity; support vector machine; systematic review; thrombosis",,"carboplatin, 41575-94-4; complement component C1s inhibitor, 80295-37-0, 80295-38-1; dexamethasone, 50-02-2; docetaxel, 114977-28-5; oxaliplatin, 61825-94-3; paclitaxel, 33069-62-4",,,,,,,"Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy logic, neural networks, and soft computing (1994) Commun ACM, 37, pp. 77-84; Michie, D., Spiegelhalter, D.J., Taylor, C.C., Machine learning, neural and statistical classification (1994), Ellis Horwood Limited; Rosenblatt, F., Principles of neurodynamics (1961) Perceptrons and the theory of brain mechanisms, , Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, Report no.

Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy (MeDALL; EU FP7-CP-IP; project no: 261357; 2010-2015) studied the complex links of allergic diseases at the clinical and mechanistic levels by linking epidemiologic, clinical, and mechanistic research, including in vivo and in vitro models. MeDALL integrated 14 European birth cohorts, including 44,010 participants and 160 cohort follow-ups between pregnancy and age 20 years. Thirteen thousand children were prospectively followed after puberty by using a newly standardized MeDALL Core Questionnaire. A microarray developed for allergen molecules with increased IgE sensitivity was obtained for 3,292 children. Estimates of air pollution exposure from previous studies were available for 10,000 children. Omics data included those from historical genome-wide association studies (23,000 children) and DNA methylation (2,173), targeted multiplex biomarker (1,427), and transcriptomic (723) studies. Using classical epidemiology and machine-learning methods in 16,147 children aged 4 years and 11,080 children aged 8 years, MeDALL showed the multimorbidity of eczema, rhinitis, and asthma and estimated that only 38% of multimorbidity was attributable to IgE sensitization. MeDALL has proposed a new vision of multimorbidity independent of IgE sensitization, and has shown that monosensitization and polysensitization represent 2 distinct phenotypes. The translational component of MeDALL is shown by the identification of a novel allergic phenotype characterized by polysensitization and multimorbidity, which is associated with the frequency, persistence, and severity of allergic symptoms. The results of MeDALL will help integrate personalized, predictive, preventative, and participatory approaches in allergic diseases. © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","allergy; Asthma; atopic dermatitis; rhinitis","allergen; biological marker; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E; air pollution; allergic disease; asthma; data base; DNA methylation; eczema; follow up; genome-wide association study; human; machine learning; medicine; microarray analysis; morbidity; outcome assessment; phenotype; pregnancy; priority journal; puberty; questionnaire; Review; rhinitis; sensitization; transcriptomics; adolescent; animal; child; clinical trial; cohort analysis; comorbidity; Europe; female; gene expression profiling; genetics; hypersensitivity; immunization; immunology; metabolism; multicenter study; phenotype; translational research; young adult; Adolescent; Allergens; Animals; Child; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Europe; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunization; Immunoglobulin E; Phenotype; Translational Medical Research; Young Adult",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Allergens; Immunoglobulin E",,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x00F6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF: 159870",,,,"Bousquet, J., Anto, J., Auffray, C., Akdis, M., Cambon-Thomsen, A., Keil, T., MeDALL (Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy): an integrated approach from phenotypes to systems medicine (2011) Allergy, 66, pp. 596-604; Martinez, F.D., Genes, environments, development and asthma: a reappraisal (2007) Eur Respir J, 29, pp. 179-184; Bousquet, J., Anto, J.M., Wickman, M., Keil, T., Valenta, R., Haahtela, T., Are allergic multimorbidities and IgE polysensitization associated with the persistence or re-occurrence of foetal type 2 signalling?

A recent phase II/III study has demonstrated the success of propranolol for involution of infantile hemangioma as well as a better efficacy and safety when indirectly compared with corticosteroids. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-utility of propranolol (Hemangiol), a new medicinal product and the first to be authorized for this specific paediatric indication, versus corticosteroids in the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma requiring systemic therapy. Methods: A life-time mixed decision tree and Markov model was developed to describe the pathway of infants with infantile hemangioma and to assess costs and outcomes in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. Clinical inputs were derived from the MA holder’s pivotal trial and literature review, and were validated by disease key opinion leaders in Italy. The economic evaluation considered direct medical costs associated with infantile hemangioma, derived from public sources. Atopic dermatitis utilities were used as a proxy for infantile hemangioma. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate model parameter variabilities. Results: The cumulative costs were €2,399.32 and €1,859.68, while cumulative QALYs were 19.11 and 18.95, respectively for propranolol and corticosteroids (Prednisolone-Deltacortene), corresponding to an incremental cost-utility ratio of €3,372.75 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that 94.60% of the 1,000 iterations fall within an a priori €30,000/QALY cost-effectiveness threshold. Conclusions: Propranolol oral solution for the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma requiring systemic therapy can be considered cost-effective compared to corticosteroids from the Italian National Health Service (NHS) perspective at a threshold fixed at €30,000/QALY. © 2015, The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,"Izadpanah, A., Kanevsky, J., Belzile, E., Propranolol versus Corticosteroids in the treatment of infantile hemangioma: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2013) Plast Reconstr Surg, 131 (3), pp. 601-613. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXjtF2mtLg%3D, PID: 23142941; Bertrand, J., McCuaig, C., Dubois, J., Hatami, A., Ondrejchak, S., Powell, J., Propranolol versus Prednisone in the treatment of infantile hemangiomas: a retrospective comparative study (2011) Ped Dermatol, 28, pp. 649-654; Bauman, N., McCarter, R., Guzzetta, P., Propranolol vs Prednisolone for symptomatic proliferating infantile hemangiomas.

However, there is also considerable variation in the list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) reported by different groups and the exact cause of AD is still not fully understood. Using a rank-based approach, we analyzed gene expression data from five different microarray studies, comprising a total of 127 samples and more than 250,000 transcripts. A total of 89 AD gene expression signatures '89ADGES', including FLG gene, were identified to show dysregulation consistently across these studies. Using a Support Vector Machine, we showed that the '89ADGES' discriminates AD from normal skin with 98% predictive accuracy. Functional annotation of these genes implicated their roles in immune responses (e.g., betadefensin, microseminoprotein), keratinocyte differentiation/epidermal development (e.g., FLG, CORIN, AQP, LOR, KRT16), inflammation (e.g., IL37, IL27RA, CCL18) and lipid metabolism (e.g., AKR1B10, FAD7, FAR2). Subsequently, we validated a subset of signature genes using quantitative PCR in a mouse model. Using a bioinformatic approach, we identified keratinocyte pathway over-represented (P = <0.0006) among the 89 signature genes. Keratinocytes are known to play a major role in barrier function due to their location in the epidermis. Our result suggests that besides immune-mediated pathway, skin barrier pathways such as the keratinocyte differentiation pathway play a key role in AD pathogenesis. A better understanding of the role of keratinocytes in AD will be important for developing novel ""barrier therapy"" for this disease. © 2015 Ghosh et al.

The availability of easy and simple tests to be used by PCP to suggest allergy should be very useful. Methods: The Respiratory Allergy Prediction (RAP) test, based on 9 questions and previously validated by a panel of experts, was evaluated in this study. Results: An overall number of 401 patients (48.6% males, age range 14-62 years) with respiratory symptoms was included. Of them, 89 (22.2%) showed negative results to SPT, while 312 (77.8%) had at least one positive result to SPT. Cohen's kappa coefficient showed that all questions had an almost perfect excellent agreement between pre and post-test. The algorithm of decision-tree growth Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector showed that answering yes to the question 4 (Your nasal/ocular complains do usually start or worsen during the spring?), 6 (Did you ever had cough or shortness of breath, even during exercise?) and 8 (Do you use nasal sprays frequently?) gave a probability to have a positive SPT of 85%. Conclusions: These findings show that RAP test can be proposed as an useful tool to be used by physician other than allergists when evaluating patients with rhinitis, suggesting the need of allergy testing. © 2015 Galimberti et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Allergic rhinitis; Allergy; Allergy testing; Pharmacists; Primary care physicians","accuracy; adolescent; adult; algorithm; allergic rhinitis; area under the curve; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; conjunctivitis; coughing; disease severity; dyspnea; female; human; major clinical study; male; predictive value; prick test; primary medical care; priority journal; probability; questionnaire; Respiratory Allergy Prediction test; respiratory tract examination; spring; symptomatology; validity",,,,,,,,,"De Marco, R., Cappa, V., Accordini, S., Rava, M., Antonicelli, L., Bortolami, O., Trends in the prevalence of asthma and allergic rhinitis in Italy between 1991 and 2010 (2012) Eur Respir J, 39, pp. 883-892. , 22005911; Bousquet, J., Van Cauwenberge, P., Khaltaev, N., Allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma (2001) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 108, pp. 147-334. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BD3MnlsVKktA%3D%3D 11707753; Bousquet, J., Bachert, C., Canonica, G.W., Casale, T.B., Cruz, A.A., Lockey, R.J., Extended global allergy and asthma european network, world allergy organization and allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma study group.

For all considered application, we propose and develop different image processing methods which enhance the diagnostic value of the technique. In particular, we use histogram analysis, Fourier analysis and neural networks, thus calculating different tissue characteristics as revealed by OCT's polarization evolution.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of and risk factors for FA in a cohort of children with AD attending a multidisciplinary paediatric allergy clinic. Methods: The analysis was performed on 386 children (50.8% boys, median age 4 years) consecutively evaluated for AD. A diagnosis of FA was established on positive skin tests and/or a specific IgE value or a positive oral food challenge. Results: Point prevalence of FA was 17.8%. Egg, peanuts, milk, tree nut and mustard accounted for 93% of cases. 37.7% of children had ≥2 positive food reactions. Risk factors associated with FA were young age (OR = 7.9 when ≤2 years compared with ≥5 years), moderate to severe AD (OR = 7.8 for severe and 2.4 for moderate AD) and onset of AD before 3 months of age (OR = 5.7). Conclusion: Point prevalence of FA in children with AD is lower than initially reported in patients recruited in a paediatric allergology setting. Children ≤2 years of age with early-onset or severe AD are at higher risk of FA and may be candidates for FA evaluation.","Atopic dermatitis; Children; Food allergy; Prevalence; Risk factors","antihistaminic agent; immunoglobulin E; immunomodulating agent; steroid; adolescent; adult; age; article; atopic dermatitis; child; clinical feature; controlled study; disease severity; egg; female; food allergy; human; infant; major clinical study; male; milk; mustard; newborn; patch test; peanut; pediatric hospital; predictive value; preschool child; prevalence; prospective study; risk factor; school child; scoring system; atopic dermatitis; complication; decision tree; Food Hypersensitivity; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Decision Trees; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Infant; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,"Stallergene, France",,,,,"Eller, E., Kjaer, H.F., Høst, A., Andersen, K.E., Bindslev-Jensen, C., Food allergy and food sensitization in early childhood: Results from the DARC cohort (2009) Allergy, 64, pp. 1023-1029; Werfel, T., Ballmer-Weber, B., Eigenmann, P.A., Eczematous reactions to food in atopic eczema: Position paper of the EAACI and GA2LEN (2007) Allergy, 62, pp. 723-728; Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis (2008) N Engl J Med, 358, pp. 1483-1494; Breuer, K., Heratizadeh, A., Wulf, A., Late eczematous reactions to food in children with atopic dermatitis (2004) Clin Exp Allergy, 34, pp. 817-824; Williams, H.C., Burney, P.G., Pembroke, A.C., Hay, R.J., Validation of the U.K. diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis in a population setting.

Infants were followed from the age of 5 weeks until 3 years of age. During this time, the number of children with AD who were treated with verum or placebo was observed at eight visits. Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed at different time points. Methods: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial performed in Germany included 606 newborns. After randomization, n = 303 patients were classified in the placebo group and n = 303 in the verum group. A total of 119 participants left the study, so data from n = 250 patients of the placebo group and n = 237 patients of the verum group were available for analysis. At the beginning of the study, newborns were treated prophylactically with bacterial lysate or placebo for 26 weeks. After this, children were observed until the age of 3 years. A systematic literature research was done to evaluate treatment costs of atopic eczema in newborn/small children. Finally, 17 publications were included and checked for searched treatment costs of AD. A study was then initiated to evaluate the direct costs to statutory health insurance. Based on the described clinical trial, a decision tree model was developed. Using the evaluated direct costs and prevalence according to the clinical trial, the developed model can be used in cost-effectiveness analyses. Results: The focus of the analyses was on the subgroup ""single heredity for atopy"" in clinical trials. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed an advantage for bacterial lysate after 3 years. To further support this result a model extension was executed; the model was expanded from 3 to 6 years. Cost-effectiveness of bacterial lysate was also proven after 6 years. Conclusion: Prophylactic treatment with bacterial lysate of infants with single heredity for atopy for 26 weeks in the 1st year of life is cost-effective at the age of 3 and 6 years, i.e. prophylactic use of bacterial lysate generated lower costs by leading to lower prevalence compared to placebo. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Atopic dermatitis; Cost-effectiveness; Decision tree; Enterococus faecalis; Escherichia coli; Model; Newborns; Prophylactic treatment; Small children; Sterile bacterial lysate","bacterium lysate; placebo; article; atopic dermatitis; child; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; decision tree; double blind procedure; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; female; health insurance; human; infant; major clinical study; male; newborn; preschool child; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; sensitivity analysis; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Cell Extracts; Child; Child, Preschool; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Double-Blind Method; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Models, Economic",,"bacterium lysate, 88402-38-4",,,,,,,"Benedetto, A.D., Agnihothri, R., Mc Grit, L., Bankova, L.G., Beck, L.A., Atopic dermatitis: A disease caused by innate immune defects?

When fed with certain hydrolyzed formulas for the first 4months of life, the risk was reduced by 26-45% in PP and 8-29% in intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses compared with children fed with regular cow's milk at age 6. The objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of feeding hydrolyzed formulas. Patients and Methods: Cost-effectiveness was assessed with a decision tree model programmed in TreeAge. Costs and effects over a 6-yr period were analyzed from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance (SHI) and a societal perspective at a 3% effective discount rate followed by sensitivity analyses. Results: The extensively hydrolyzed casein formula would be the most cost-saving strategy with savings of 478€ per child treated in the ITT analysis (CI95%: 12€; 852€) and 979€ in the PP analysis (95%CI: 355€; 1455€) from a societal perspective. If prevented cases are considered, the partially whey hydrolyzed formula is cost-saving (ITT -5404€, PP -6358€). From an SHI perspective, the partially whey hydrolyzed formula is cost-effective, but may also be cost-saving depending on the scenario. An extensively hydrolyzed whey formula also included into the analysis was dominated in all analyses. Conclusions: For the prevention of AE, two formulas can be cost-effective or even cost-saving. We recommend that SHI should reimburse formula feeding or at least the difference between costs for cow's milk formula and the most cost-effective formula. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Atopic dermatitis; Atopic eczema; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Hydrolyzed formula; Nutrition; Prevention","casein hydrolysate; article; artificial milk; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; economic evaluation; feeding; Germany; health insurance; human; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; milk; newborn; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; sensitivity analysis; Absenteeism; Animals; Caseins; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Double-Blind Method; Female; Germany; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant Formula; Infant, Newborn; Male; Milk; Milk Proteins; Prevalence; Protein Hydrolysates; Risk",,"casein hydrolysate, 65072-00-6; Caseins; Milk Proteins; Protein Hydrolysates; whey protein",,,,,,,"Cookson, W.O., Moffatt, M.F., The genetics of atopic dermatitis (2002) Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol, 2, pp. 383-387; Fröschl, B., Arts, D., Leopold, C., (2008) [Health Technology Assessment-Topical Anti-Inflammatory Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis in Children], , Cologne: Deutsches Institut für Medizinische Dokumentation und Information; Schlaud, M., Atzpodien, K., Thierfelder, W., [Allergic diseases Results from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS)] (2007) Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz, 50, pp. 701-710; Olesen, A.B., Juul, S., Thestrup-Pedersen, K., Atopic dermatitis is increased following vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella or measles infection (2003) Acta Derm Venereol, 83, pp. 445-450; Krauth, C., Dintsios, C., Brandes, I., Wasem, J., (2005) Zeitschrift für die gesamte Versicherungswissenschaft, 94, pp. 215-216; Ring, J., Brockow, K., Abeck, D., The therapeutic concept of ""patient management"" in atopic eczema (1996) Allergy, 51, pp. 206-215; Gdalevich, M., Mimouni, D., David, M., Mimouni, M., Breast-feeding and the onset of atopic dermatitis in childhood: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies (2001) J Am Acad Dermatol, 45, pp. 520-527; Yang, Y.W., Tsai, C.L., Lu, C.Y., Exclusive breastfeeding and incident atopic dermatitis in childhood: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies (2009) Br J Dermatol, 161, pp. 373-383; Osborn, D.A., Sinn, J., Formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants (2006) Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, , issue 3 pp. CD003664; von Berg, A., von Koletzko, S., Grübl, A., The effect of hydrolyzed cow's milk formula for allergy prevention in the first year of life: The German Infant Nutritional Intervention Study, a randomized double-blind trial (2003) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 111, pp. 533-540; von Berg, A., Filipiak-Pittroff, B., Krämer, U., Preventive effect of hydrolyzed infant formulas persist until age 6years: long-term results from the German Infant Nutritional Intervention Study (GINI) (2008) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 121, pp. 1442-1447; von Berg, A., von Koletzko, S., Grübl, A., Certain hydrolyzed formulas reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis but not that of asthma: three-year results of the German Infant Nutritional Intervention Study (2007) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 119, pp. 718-725; (2008), Statistisches Bundesamt Health: Diagnosis data of patients in hospitals (inclusive mortality and per hour cases); special series 12, series 6.2.1, 2007; Wiesbaden:; http://www.g-drg.de/cms/inek_site_de/layout/set/standard/Archiv/Systemjahr_2011_bzw._Datenjahr_2009, Institut für das Entgeldsystem im Krankenhaus: Diagnosis related groups calculation 2009, Siegburg 2011; Ehlken, B., Mohrenschlager, M., Kugland, B., Berger, K., Quednau, K., Ring, J., [Cost-of-illness study in patients suffering from atopic eczema in Germany] (2005) Hautarzt, 56, pp. 1144-1151; Krauth, C., Hessel, F., Hansmeier, T., Wasem, J., Seitz, R., Schweikert, B., [Empirical standard costs for health economic evaluation in Germany - a proposal by the working group methods in health economic evaluation] (2005) Gesundheitswesen, 67, pp. 736-746; (2010), Oral communication from Children's Rehabilitation Center Waldburg-Zeil Kliniken; Zutavern, A., Schaaf, B., von Berg, A., [Use of homeopathy and consultation by medical practitioners.

Without such rigorous analysis, the elimination of CMP is unjustified, and sometimes harmful. The elimination diet should be strictly followed, at least until 9-12 months of age. If the child is not breast fed or the mother cannot or no longer wishes to breast feed, the first choice is an extensively hydrolysed formula (eHF) of CMP, the efficacy of which has been demonstrated by scientifically sound studies. If it is not tolerated, an amino acid-based formula is warranted. A rice protein-based eHF can be an alternative to a CMP-based eHF. Soya protein-based infant formulae are also a suitable alternative for infants >6 months, after establishing tolerance to soya protein by clinical challenge. CMPA usually resolves during the first 2-3 years. However, the age of recovery varies depending on the child and the type of CMPA, especially whether it is IgE-mediated or not, with the former being more persistent. Once the child reaches the age of 9-12 months, an oral food challenge is carried out in the hospital ward to assess the development of tolerance and, if possible, to allow for the continued reintroduction of CMP at home. Some children with CMPA will tolerate only a limited daily amount of CMP. The current therapeutic options are designed to accelerate the acquisition of tolerance thereof, which seems to be facilitated by repeated exposure to CMP. © 2011 The Authors.","Allergy; Children; Cows' milk proteins; Diet; Hydrolysates","amino acid; cow protein hydrolysate; immunoglobulin E antibody; lactose; milk protein; probiotic agent; protein hydrolysate; rice protein hydrolysate; soybean protein; unclassified drug; allergenicity; anaphylactic shock; artificial milk; asthma; atopic dermatitis; beaf meat; body height; body weight; breast feeding; calcium intake; cooking; cross reaction; dairy product; desensitization; diagnostic test; diet supplementation; diet therapy; ewe milk; extensively hydrolysed formula; food composition; food packaging; gastrointestinal symptom; goat milk; hospital admission; human; immunotherapy; infant nutrition; iron deficiency anemia; lactose intolerance; meat; milk; milk allergy; molecular weight; nutritional status; patient education; protein content; provocation test; reimbursement; review; school; sublingual desensitization; Amino Acids; Breast Feeding; Child; Child, Preschool; Decision Trees; European Union; France; Humans; Immune Tolerance; Infant; Infant Food; Infant Formula; Milk Hypersensitivity; Milk Proteins; Nutritive Value; Plant Proteins; Protein Hydrolysates; Remission, Spontaneous",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; lactose, 10039-26-6, 16984-38-6, 63-42-3, 64044-51-5; protein hydrolysate, 76773-71-2, 9015-54-7; soybean protein, 9010-10-0; Amino Acids; Milk Proteins; Plant Proteins; Protein Hydrolysates",,,,,,,"Host, A., Frequency of cow's milk allergy in childhood (2002) Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, 89 (6 SUPPL. 1), pp. 33-37; Noimark, L., Cox, H.E., Nutritional problems related to food allergy in childhood (2008) Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, 19 (2), pp. 188-195. , DOI 10.1111/j.1399-3038.2007.00700.x; Tuokkola, J., Kaila, M., Pietinen, P., Agreement between parental reports and patient records in food allergies among infants and young children in Finland (2008) J Eval Clin Pract, 14, pp. 984-989; Savilahti, E., Food-induced malabsorption syndromes (2000) Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, 30 (SUPPL. 1), pp. S61-S66. , DOI 10.1097/00005176-200001001-00010; Ferrara, M., Coppola, L., Coppola, A., Capozzi, L., Iron deficiency in childhood and adolescence: Retrospective review (2006) Hematology, 11 (3), pp. 183-186. , DOI 10.1080/10245330600775105, PII L0NR737363X61702; Chouraqui, J.P., Dupont, C., Bocquet, A., Feeding during the first months of life and prevention of allergy (in French (2008) Arch Pediatr, 15, pp. 431-442. , (Committee on Nutrition of the French Society of Pediatrics); The use of antigen reduced infant formulae (in French (2000) Arch Pediatr, 7, pp. 302-306. , Committee on Nutrition of the French Society of Pediatrics; Vandenplas, Y., Brueton, M., Dupont, C., Hill, D., Isolauri, E., Koletzko, S., Oranje, A.P., Staiano, A., Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cow's milk protein allergy in infants (2007) Archives of Disease in Childhood, 92 (10), pp. 902-908. , DOI 10.1136/adc.2006.110999; (1999) Off J Eur Commun, , http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uriOJ:L:1999:091:0029: 0036:EN:PDF, Commission Directive 1999/21/EC of 25 March 1999 on dietary foods for special medical purposes (1999) 7 April L 91/29 (accessed 15 July 2011); (2006) Off J Eur Union, , http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uriOJ:L:2006:401:0001: 0033:EN:PDF, Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae and amending Directive 1999/21/EC 30 December L 401/1.

They present with the same lesions, erythematous scaly lesions. Clinical evaluation of skin lesions is based on common sense and experience of the dermatologist to differentiate features of each disease. Aim: To evaluate a computer-based image analysis system as a helping tool for classification of commonly encountered diseases. Materials and Methods: The study included 50 selected images from each of psoriasis, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, pityrasis rosea, and pitryasis rubra pilaris with a total of 300 images. The study comprised three main processes peformed on the 300 included images: segmentation, feature extraction followed by classification. Results: Rough sets recorded the highest percentage of accuracy and sensitivity of segmentation for the six groups of diseases compared with the other three used techniques (topological derivative, K-means clustering, and watershed). Rule-based classifier using the concept of rough sets recorded the best percentage of classification (96.7%) for the six groups of diseases compared with the other six techniques of classification used: K-means clustering, fuzzy c-means clustering, classification and regression tree, rule-based classifier with discretization, and K-nearest neighbor technique. Conclusion: Rough sets approach proves its superiority for both the segmentation and the classification processes of papulo-squamous skin diseases compared with the other used segmentation and classification techniques. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Classification; Feature extraction; Papulo-Squamous skin diseases; ROC; Rough sets; Segmentation","Atopic dermatitis; Classification and regression tree; Classification process; Classification technique; Clinical evaluation; Clinical features; Close-in; Common sense; Discretizations; Fuzzy C means clustering; Image analysis systems; K-means clustering; K-nearest neighbors; Main process; Papulo-Squamous skin diseases; ROC; Rough set; Rule-based classifier; Skin disease; Skin lesion; Topological derivatives; Classification (of information); Computer aided analysis; Dermatitis; Dermatology; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Rough set theory; Image segmentation; article; atopic dermatitis; clinical feature; disease classification; erythematosquamous skin disease; human; image analysis; lichen planus; pityriasis rosea; pityriasis rubra pilaris; psoriasis; seborrheic dermatitis; Dermoscopy; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photography; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Skin Diseases, Papulosquamous",,,,,,,,,"Griffiths, C.E.M., Camp, R.D.R., Barker, J.N.W.N., Psoriasis (2004) Rook's textbook of dermatology.

Objective: To identify phenotypes of severe recurrent wheezing and therapeutic approaches. Methods: We performed cluster analysis with 20 variables of 551 children with active asthma, younger than 36 months old, and enrolled in the Trousseau Asthma Program. Results: We identified 3 independent clusters of children with wheezing. Cluster 1, mild episodic viral wheeze (n = 327), consisted of children with wheezing related only to colds (71%), mild disease (76%), and mainly normal chest x-ray results. Cluster 2, nonatopic uncontrolled wheeze (n = 157), was characterized by moderate to severe disease (91%), uncontrolled wheezing despite high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (55%), parents with asthma, and increased levels of ferritine. Cluster 3, atopic multiple-trigger wheeze (n = 67), included more children with multiple-trigger wheeze (68%) than did clusters 1 or 2; eczema (75%); a positive result from the Phadiatop Infant test (90%); increased levels of IgE, IgA, and IgG; and abnormal results from chest x-rays. In separate analysis, 1 parameter for boys (increased total level of IgE) and 2 parameters for girls (wheezing severity and increased total level of IgE) properly classified 90% of boys and 83% of girls in the appropriate cluster. Significant associations were found between overcrowding, molds and cockroaches at home, and atopic multiple-trigger wheeze and between day-care attendance and nonatopic uncontrolled wheeze in other parts. Conclusion: We identified different phenotypes of recurrent wheezing in young children by using cluster analysis with usual variables. These phenotypes require confirmation in longer, follow-up studies. © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","allergy; ICS; preschool children; Risk factors","alpha 1 antitrypsin; ferritin; fluticasone; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin G; abnormal laboratory result; allergic rhinitis; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; classification; cluster analysis; cockroach; common cold; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; disease severity; drug megadose; female; follow up; food allergy; groups by age; home environment; human; immunoassay; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; mould; neutrophil; parent; patient compliance; Phadiatop Infant test; phenotype; preschool child; priority journal; random forest; recurrent disease; risk factor; sex difference; thorax radiography; treatment outcome; virus infection; wheezing",,"alpha 1 antitrypsin, 9041-92-3; ferritin, 9007-73-2; fluticasone, 90566-53-3; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9",,,,,,,"Illi, S., Von Mutius, E., Lau, S., Niggemann, B., Gruber, C., Wahn, U., Perennial allergen sensitisation early in life and chronic asthma in children: A birth cohort study (2006) Lancet, 368 (9537), pp. 763-770. , DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69286-6, PII S0140673606692866; Martinez, F.D., Wright, A.L., Taussig, L.M., Holberg, C.J., Halonen, M., Morgan, W.J., Asthma and wheezing in the first six years of life.

The pathophysiology of food allergy (FA) relies on immune reactions triggered by epitopes, i.e. small amino-acid sequences able to bind to antibodies or cells. Some food allergens share specific physicochemical characteristics that allow them to resist digestion, thus enhancing allergenicity. These allergens encounter specialized dendritic cell populations in the gut, which leads to T-cell priming. In case of IgE-mediated allergy, this process triggers the production of allergen-specific IgE by B cells. Tissue-resident reactive cells, including mast cells, then bind IgE, and allergic reactions are elicited when these cells, with adjacent IgE molecules bound to their surface, are re-exposed to allergen. Allergic reactions occurring in the absence of detectable IgE are labeled non-IgE mediated. The abrogation of oral tolerance which leads to FA is likely favored by genetic disposition and environmental factors (e.g. increased hygiene or enhanced allergenicity of some foods). For an accurate diagnosis, complete medical history, laboratory tests and, in most cases, an oral food challenge are needed. Noticeably, the detection of food-specific IgE (sensitization) does not necessarily indicate clinical allergy. Novel diagnostic methods currently under study focus on the immune responses to specific food proteins or epitopes of specific proteins. Food-induced allergic reactions represent a large array of symptoms involving the skin and gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. They can be attributed to IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated (cellular) mechanisms and thus differ in their nature, severity and outcome. Outcome also differs according to allergens.

NGF is also an inflammatory mediator associated with pain and itch. Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis is a genetic disorder due to loss-of-function mutations in the NTRK1 gene encoding TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase for NGF. Since patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis lack NGF-dependent unmyelinated (C-) and thinly myelinated (A-) fibers, and their dermal sweat glands are without innervation, they exhibit no pain, itch, signs of neurogenic inflammation or sympathetic skin responses. Based on the pathophysiology of congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis, this article indicates how NGF-dependent neurons are essential for the establishment of neural networks for interoception and homeostasis, and play crucial roles in brain-immune-endocrine interactions in pain, itch and inflammation. In addition, it refers to involvements of the NGF-TrkA system in various disease states, and potential pharmacological effects when this system is targeted. © 2010 Expert Reviews Ltd.","hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV; interoception; NGF-dependent primary afferent neurons; NTRK1 gene; polymodal receptors; receptor tyrosine kinase for NGF; sympathetic neurons; TrkA protein","analgesic agent; nerve growth factor; nerve growth factor neutralizing agent; protein tyrosine kinase A; tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor; unclassified drug; anhidrosis; atopic dermatitis; congenital analgesia; gene mutation; homeostasis; human; immunomodulation; inflammation; nonhuman; pain; protein expression; pruritus; respiratory tract inflammation; review; rheumatic disease; rheumatoid arthritis; sensitization; sympathetic nerve cell; Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathies; Humans; Hypohidrosis; Inflammation; Nerve Growth Factor; Neurons; Pain; Pruritus",,"nerve growth factor, 9061-61-4; Nerve Growth Factor, 9061-61-4",,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 21600010

To date, a number of academic reports concerning the biological activities of lactoferrin have been published and are easily accessible through public data repositories. However, as the literature is expanding daily, this presents challenges in understanding the larger picture of lactoferrin function and mechanisms. In order to overcome the ""analysis paralysis"" associated with lactoferrin information, we attempted to apply a text mining method to the accumulated lactoferrin literature. To this end, we used the information extraction system GENPAC (provided by Nalapro Technologies Inc., Tokyo). This information extraction system uses natural language processing and text mining technology. This system analyzes the sentences and titles from abstracts stored in the PubMed database, and can automatically extract binary relations that consist of interactions between genes/proteins, chemicals and diseases/functions. We expect that such information visualization analysis will be useful in determining novel relationships among a multitude of lactoferrin functions and mechanisms. We have demonstrated the utilization of this method to find pathways of lactoferrin participation in neovascularization, Helicobacter pylori attack on gastric mucosa, atopic dermatitis and lipid metabolism. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Angiogenesis;

Patients and methods: Eighty-seven OPT were performed on 72 patients aged 8 months to 15 years mainly suffering from food induced oedema and atopic dermatitis. Culprit foods were mainly peanut, egg, milk and fish. Flow cytometry was performed according to the IgE/CD63 protocol and results were expressed in percentage CD63 and in activation index (AI) calculated according to a specific algorithm. Results: Results obtained from the negative OCT led to the definition of the BAT clinical positive thresholds, 30% for the percentage CD63 and 100 for the AI, the statistical thresholds being 5% for the percentage CD63 and 16 for the AI. In these conditions, the positive and negative values (PPV and NPV) observed for the TAB were 0.95 and 0.77 for the percentage CD63 and 0.82 and 0.6 for the AI. On the basis of these results and of the results of the skin tests and specific IgE tested in parallel, we defined a decision tree which could lead to decrease the number of necessary OPT by three. Conclusions: Among the different tests performed here, flow cytometry showed the highest efficacy, as compared to simple blind oral challenge tests. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We now report the development of a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay that uses expression values for just 5 of those genes: STAT4, GATA-3, PLS3, CD1D, and TRAIL. qRT-PCR data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) accurately classified 88% of 17 patients with high blood tumor burden and 100% of 12 healthy controls in the training set using Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA). The same 5 genes were then assayed on 56 new samples from 49 SS patients with blood tumor burdens of 5% to 99% and 69 samples from 65 new healthy controls. The average accuracy over 1000 resamplings was 90% using FLDA and 88% using support vector machine (SVM). We also tested the classifier on 14 samples from patients with CTCL with no detectable peripheral involvement and 3 patients with atopic dermatitis with severe erythroderma. The accuracy was 100% in identifying these samples as non-SS patients. These results are the first to demonstrate that gene expression profiling by quantitative PCR on a selected number of critical genes can be employed to molecularly diagnosis SS. © 2006 by The American Society of Hematology.",,"CD1d antigen; plastin t; protein; STAT4 protein; transcription factor GATA 3; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; unclassified drug; adult; aged; article; atopic dermatitis; blood sampling; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; controlled study; cutaneous T cell lymphoma; data analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic procedure; discriminant analysis; disease severity; erythroderma; gene; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene identification; gene pls3; human; human tissue; major clinical study; microarray analysis; oncogene; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Sezary syndrome; training; tumor cell; tumor volume; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dermatitis, Exfoliative; Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic; Humans; Predictive Value of Tests; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sezary Syndrome; Skin Neoplasms; Tumor Burden",,"protein, 67254-75-5; transcription factor GATA 3, 137878-55-8",,,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: P30CA010815, R01CA106553, T32CA009171, U01CA085060

Clin./Allergol., CHU de Nancy, Hôpital Central, 54035 Nancy Cedex, France","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the first manifestations of the atopic march. The natural history of food allergies (FA) is closely related to AD. Sensitivity to food is demonstrated with cutaneous tests (prick-tests and atopy patch-tests) or the presence of IgE specific to food. A true allergy to a foodstuff is revealed by oral provocation tests (OPT) or by improvement during an avoidance diet. Ingestion of the food allergen during OPT can provoke an onset of eczema, an immediate reaction (urticaria, oedema) or involve other target organs (digestive disorders, rhinitis, asthma or anaphylactic shock). Seven allergens are responsible for around 90 p. 100 of FA: milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts, nuts, soy and fish. The fundamental knowledge acquired demonstrates the implication of food allergens in the physiopathogenesis of AD. The assessment of the efficacy of avoidance diets is difficult to demonstrate in standardised double-blind studies. Their efficacy is demonstrated compared with the natural history of AD. A diagnostic algorythm of FA during AD is proposed. An avoidance diet can be prescribed on 3 levels: primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. Diagnostic dietetics are aimed at initiating a hypoallergenic diet over a short period of 15 to 21 days when AD is severe and does not permit an allergy assessment. This diet is followed by an allergy assessment and OPT to determine the foodstuff responsible. Therapeutic dietetics consists in initiating an avoidance diet based on the results of the allergy assessment: positive predictive value of specific IgE, positivity of oral provocation tests or the re-introduction of the foodstuff for one week. Preventive dietetics is aimed at preventing the onset of AD: a consensus has been established by the American and European Academies of Paediatrics. In conclusion, present knowledge demonstrates that FA is a triggering factor for AD and that the avoidance diets based on allergy assessments are an essential tool in the treatment of AD. Understanding the triggering mechanisms of oral tolerance will permit the development of strategies for the prevention and cure of food allergies.",,"food allergen; immunoglobulin E; algorithm; allergy test; anaphylactic shock; antibody specificity; antibody titer; asthma; atopic dermatitis; clinical feature; conference paper; consensus; diet restriction; dietetics; disease association; eczema; edema; egg; fish; food allergy; gastrointestinal disease; human; milk; nut; outcomes research; patch test; pathophysiology; peanut; prick test; primary prevention; provocation test; secondary prevention; soybean; urticaria; wheat; Child; Decision Trees; Dermatitis, Atopic; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,"Sampson, H.A., The evaluation and management of food allergy in atopic dermatitis (2003) Clinic in Dermatology, 21, pp. 183-192; Johansson, S.G.O., Hourihane, J.O.B., Bousquet, J., Brujinzeel-Koomen, C., Dreborg, S., Haahtela, T., A revised nomenclature for allergy (2001) Allergy, 56, pp. 813-824; Burks, A.W., James, J.M., Hiegel, A., Wilson, G., Wheeler, J.G., Jones, S.M., Atopic dermatitis and food hypersensitivity reactions (1988) J Pediatr, 132, pp. 132-136; Hill, D.J., Sporik, R., Thorburn, J., Hosking, C.S., The association of atopic dermatitis in infancy with immunoglobulin E food sensitization (2000) J Pediatr, 137, pp. 475-479; Böhme, M., Svensson, A., Kull, I., Nordvall, S.L., Wahlgren, C.F., Clinical features of atopic dermatitis at two years of age: A prospective, population-based case-control study (2001) Acta Derm Venereol, 81, pp. 193-197; Custafsson, D., Sjöberg, O., Foucard, T., Sensitization to food and airborne allergens in children with atopic dermatitis followed up to 7 years of age (2003) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 14, pp. 448-452; Cantani, A., Micera, M., Epidemiology of atopy in 220 children: Diagnostic reliability of skin prick-tests and total and specific IgE levels (2003) Minerva Pediatr, 55, pp. 129-142; Wolkerstorfer, A., Wahn, U., Kjellman, N.I.M., Diepgens, T., De Longueville, M., Oranje, A., Natural course of sensitization to cow's milk and hen's egg in childhood atopic dermatitis: ETAC study group (2002) Clin Exp Allergy, 32, pp. 70-73; Schoetzau, A., Filipiak-Pittroff, B., Franke, K., Koletzko, S., Von Berg, A., Gruebl, A., Effect of exclusive breast-feeding and early solid food avoidance on the incidence of atopic dermatitis in high-risk infants at 1 year of age (2002) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 13, pp. 234-242; Moneret-Vautrin, D.A., Kanny, G., Guérin, L., Flabbee, J., Lemerdy, P., Le syndrome des allergies alimentaires multiples (2000) Allergie Immunol, 32, pp. 12-15; Illi, S., Von Mutius, E., Lau, S., Nickel, R., Grüber, C., Niggemann, B., The natural course of atopic dermatitis from birth to age of 7 years and the association with asthma (2004) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 113, pp. 925-931; De Maat-Bleeker, F., Bruinzeel-Koomen, C.A., Food allergy indults with atopic dermatitis (1996) Monogr Allergy Highlights in Food Allergy, 32, pp. 157-164. , Wüthrich B, Ortolani C (eds).

We applied the prediction method to four allergic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic conjunctivitis (AC), allergic rhinitis (AR) and bronchial asthma (BA), and verified its predictive ability. Almost all the learning data were precisely predicted. Regarding the evaluation data, the learned ANN model could correctly predict a diagnosis with more than 78% accuracy. We also analyzed the SNP data using multiple regression analysis (MRA). Using the MRA model, less than 10% of patients with the above allergic diseases were correctly diagnosed, while this figure was more than 75% for persons without allergic diseases. From these results, it was shown that the ANN model was superior to the MRA model with respect to predictive ability of allergic diseases. Moreover, we used two different methods to convert the genetic polymorphism data into numerical data. Using both methods, diagnostic predictions were quite precise and almost the same predictive abilities were observed. This is the first study showing the application and usefulness of an ANN for the prediction of allergic diseases based on SNP data.","Allergic disease; ANN; Predictive model; SNP","Diagnosis; Diseases; Neural networks; Patient treatment; Regression analysis; Polymorphisms; Biomedical engineering; allergic conjunctivitis; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; article; artificial neural network; asthma; atopic dermatitis; diagnostic accuracy; genetic polymorphism; nonhuman; single nucleotide polymorphism",,,,,,,,,"Makino, S., (1992) Rinsho alerugi gaku, , Nankaido, Tokyo. in Japanese; Iwasa, H., Kurabayashi, M., Nagai, R., Nakamura, Y., Tanaka, T., Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Japanese population in six candidate genes for long QT syndrome (2001) J.

Attempts to relieve the itch by scratching simply worsen the rash, creating a vicious circle. Treatment should be directed at limiting itching, repairing the skin and decreasing inflammation when necessary. Lubricants, antihistamines and topical corticosteroids are the mainstays of therapy. When required, oral corticosteroids can be used. If pruritus does not respond to treatment, other diagnoses, such as bacterial overgrowth or vital infections, should be considered.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 4610 replies were received: 2714 from mothers of infants (12 month old) and 1,896 from mothers of children (2 years old). The sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy were calculated from probabilistic model by neural network analysis (NNA) and multiple logistic regression analysis (MLA). RESULTS: Risk factors for probabilistic model by NNA were family history (father, mother, siblings, grand father, grand mother), food restriction, food allergy, age, food restriction of mother, egg introduced time, cow's milk introduced time. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of NNA model was 88.6%, 99.5% and 96.4%, respectively and MLA model was 75.1%, 82.6% and 82.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the NNA is a good and useful method for prediction of onset of AD than MLA. Furthermore, It is necessary to investigate the artificial neural networks for diagnosis and/or treatment by physician.",,"article; artificial neural network; atopic dermatitis; epidemiology; female; human; infant; male; preschool child; statistical model; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Humans; Infant; Logistic Models; Male; Models, Statistical; Neural Networks (Computer)",,,,,,,,,,"Takahashi, K.",,,,,,,,00214884,,,"10630022","Japanese","Arerugi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033218308
