This genus has been grown in temperate regions and used for treating wounds, eczema and burns. The aim of this study was to predict the content of hypericin in Hypericum perforatum in varied ecological and phenological conditions of habitat using artificial neural network techniques [MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), RBF (Radial Basis Function) and SVM (Support Vector Machine)]. Results: According to the results, the MLP model (R2 = 0.87) had an advantage over RBF (R2 = 0.8) and SVM (R2 = 0.54) models and it was relatively accurate in predicting hypericin content in H. perforatum based on the ecological conditions of site including soil types, its characteristics and plant phenological stages of habitat. The results of sensitivity analysis revealed that phenological stages, hill aspects, total nitrogen, altitude and organic carbon are the most influential factors that have an integral effect on the content of hypericin. Conclusions: The designed graphical user interface will help pharmacognosist, manufacturers and producers of medicinal plants and so on to run the MLP model on new data to easily discover the content of hypericin in H. perforatum by entering ecological conditions of site, soil characteristics and plant phenological stages. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial neural network; Ecological modeling; Graphical user interface; Hypericin; Hypericum perforatum",,,,,,,"We are grateful to the College of Environment in National Department of Environment in Iran for partially cooperation in data collection.

The initiation of a type 2 immune response involves an intricate crosstalk between structural and immune cells. Structural cells react to physical and chemical tissue perturbations by secreting alarmins, which signal the innate immune system to restore homeostasis. This pathway acts autonomously in the context of sterile injury and in the presence of foreign antigen initiates an adaptive Th2 response that is beneficial in the context of venoms, toxins, and helminths, but not food allergens. The investigation of the triggers and mechanisms underlying food allergic sensitization in humans is elusive because sensitization is a silent process. Therefore, the central construct driving food allergy modeling is based on introducing perturbations of tissue homeostasis along with an allergen which will result in an immunological and clinical phenotype that is consistent with that observed in humans. The collective evidence from multiple models has revealed the pre-eminent role of innate cells and molecules in the elicitation of allergic sensitization. We posit that, with the expanding use of technologies capable of producing formidable datasets, models of food allergy will continue to have an indispensable role to delineate mechanisms and establish causal relationships. © Copyright © 2020 Bruton, Koenig, Phelps and Jordana.","animal modeling; food allergy; homeostasis; Th2; type 2 immunity","alarmin; allergen; aluminum hydroxide; amphiregulin; autoantibody; cytokine; filaggrin; gamma interferon; histamine; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 13; interleukin 5; poison; Staphylococcus enterotoxin B; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; toxin; transcription factor GATA 3; tumor necrosis factor; uric acid; venom; adaptive immunity; allergy; anaphylactoid purpura; anaphylaxis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antigen presenting cell; asthma; atopic dermatitis; autoimmune disease; bioinformatics; Bordetella pertussis; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell differentiation; dendritic cell; dog; dysbiosis; eczema; energy expenditure; Escherichia coli; flow cytometry; gene expression; genotype; helminth; homeostasis; human; immune response; immune system; immunocompetent cell; immunological tolerance; inflammation; injury; innate immunity; lymphoid cell; machine learning; microbiome; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; prick test; protein expression; pruritus; Review; RNA sequence; seizure; sensitization; single cell RNA seq; Th2 cell; urticaria; wheezing; wound healing",,"aluminum hydroxide, 1330-44-5, 20257-20-9, 21645-51-2, 80206-84-4; amphiregulin, 117147-70-3; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; histamine, 51-45-6, 56-92-8, 93443-21-1; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; interleukin 12, 138415-13-1; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, 39424-53-8; transcription factor GATA 3, 137878-55-8; uric acid, 69-93-2",,,"Canadian Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Foundation, CAAIF

Being in a global initiative of characterisation of black skin horny layer (stratum corneum) by digital images analysis, the authors in this study proposed a four-step approach. The first step consists of differentiation between probable healthy skin regions and those affected. For that, they used an automatic classification system based on multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks. The network has been trained with texture and colour features. Best features selection and network architecture definition were done using sequential network construction algorithm-based method. After classification, selected regions undergo a colour transformation, in order to increase the contrast with the lesion region. Thirdly, created colour information serves as the basis for a modified fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm to perform segmentation. The proposed method, named neural network-based fuzzy clustering, was applied to many black skin lesion images and they obtained segmentation rates up to 94.67%. The last stage consists in calculating characteristics. Eight parameters are concerned: uniformity, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, smoothness, entropy, and average pixel values calculated for red and blue colour channels. All developed methods were tested with a database of 600 images and obtained results were discussed and compared with similar works. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

A solution for this disease is very crucial for patients to have better treatment. Eczema is usually detected manually by doctors or dermatologists. It is tough to distinguish between different types of Eczema because of the similarities in symptoms. In recent years, several attempts have been taken to automate the detection of skin diseases with much accuracy. Many methods such as Image Processing Techniques, Machine Learning algorithms are getting used to execute segmentation and classification of skin diseases. It is found that among all those skin disease detection systems, particularly detection work on eczema disease is rare. There is also insufficiency in eczema disease dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel deep CNN-based approach for classifying five different classes of Eczema with our collected dataset. Data augmentation is used to transform images for better performance. Regularization techniques such as batch normalization and dropout helped to reduce overfitting. Our proposed model achieved an accuracy of 96.2%, which exceeded the performance of the state of the arts. © 2020 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; classification; CNN; computer vision; dataset; Eczema diseases","Dermatology; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Patient treatment; Data augmentation; Different class; Image processing technique; Overfitting; Regularization technique; Skin disease; State of the art; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Wang, X., Shi, X.D., Li, L.F., Zhou, P., Shen, Y.W., Classification and possible bacterial infection in outpatients with eczema and dermatitis in China: A cross-sectional and multicenter study (2017) Medicine (Baltimore, 96 (35), p. 7955; Hanifin, J.M., Reed, M.L., Eczema prevalence and impact working group A population-based survey of eczema prevalence in the United States (2007) Dermatitis, 18 (2), pp. 82-91; Shaw Tatyana, E., Currie Gabriel, P., Koudelka Caroline, W., Simpson Eric, L., Eczema prevalence in the United States: Data from the 2003 National Survey of Children?s Health (2011) Journal of Investigative Dermatology, 131 (1), pp. 67-73. , Elsevier; https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1124528, [Last visited September, 2020]; Van Der Heiden, J., Agner, T., Rustemeyer, T., Clemmensen, K.K.B., Hyperkeratotic hand eczema compared to other subgroups of hand eczema-A retrospective study with a follow-up questionnaire (2018) Contact Dermatitis, 78, pp. 216-222; https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/types-of-eczema/nummular-eczema/, Last visited September, 2020]; Xiu-Qing, W., Hong-Yang, X., Zhong-Li, W., The research of ear identification based on improved algorithm of moment invariant (2010) 2010 Third International Conference on Information and Computing, 1, pp. 58-60; Pham, T.C., Luong, C.M., Visani, M., Hoang, V.D., Deep CNN and Data Augmentation for Skin Lesion Classification (2018) Intelligent Information and Database Systems.

Mining big data such as the information encoded in nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites has challenged researchers for several years now. Even though bioinformatics and system biology techniques have improved greatly and many improvements have been done in these fields of research, most of the processes that influence gene interaction over time are still unknown. In this study, we apply state-of-the art spiking neural network techniques to model, analyse and extract information about the regulatory processes of gene expression over time. A case study of microarray profiling in human skin during elicitation of eczema is used to examine the temporal association of genes involved in the inflammatory response, by means of a gene interaction network. Spiking neural network techniques are able to learn the interaction between genes using information encoded from the time-series gene expression data as spikes. The temporal interaction is learned, and the patterns of activity extracted and analysed with a gene interaction network. Results demonstrated that useful knowledge can be extracted from the data by using spiking neural network, unlocking some of the possible mechanisms involved in the regulatory process of gene expression. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Allergic contact dermatitis; Artificial intelligence; Data analysis; Evolving spiking neural networks; Gene expression; Gene interaction networks; Microarray; Nickel allergy; Transcriptome","Artificial intelligence; Association reactions; Data mining; Data reduction; Gene expression; Metabolites; Microarrays; Nucleic acids; Time series; Allergic contact dermatitis; Extract informations; Gene interaction networks; Inflammatory response; Spiking neural networks; Temporal association; Time-series gene expression data; Transcriptomes; Neural networks",,,,,"Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, AUT: SRIF INTERACT 2017-18","Several people have contributed to the research that resulted in this work, especially: Dr. Y.

We have studied three supervised learning methods for segmentation of lesions: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayesian Classifier (NBC) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Two sets of images that are different in erythema severity levels (mild, moderate) are used for training the supervised classifiers. From the training images 108 features are extracted that are ranked using four feature ranking methods (standard deviation, T-statistical score, fisher scoring, and correlation coefficient) to obtain the most significant features. The performance of classification is investigated using green channel of RGB and CSN-I RGB color space. The performance of the different methods is assessed by comparing the segmented lesions with the gold standard segmented images. Based on these comparisons, it is observed that SVM classifier shows the best segmentation result having an accuracy of 84.43% whereas the accuracy of NBC and KNN is 82.77% and 83.53% respectively. © 2020 IEEE.","classification; color models; Eczema lesions; segmentation; supervised learning","Dermatology; Nearest neighbor search; Sodium compounds; Support vector machines; Automatic segmentations; Bayesian classifier; Correlation coefficient; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Segmentation results; Standard deviation; Supervised classifiers; Supervised learning methods; Learning systems",,,,,,,,"Finlay, A.Y., Measurement of disease activity and outcome in atopic dermatitis (1996) Br J Dermatol, 135 (4), pp. 509-515; Williams, H., Robertson, C., Stewart, A., Worldwide variations in the prevalence of symptoms of atopic eczema in the international study of asthama and allergies in childhood (1999) J.

Aims: To identify biophysical and ultrasonographic properties for the differentiation of five main groups of papulosquamous skin diseases. Methods: Fifteen biophysical and ultrasonographic parameters were measured by multiprobe adapter system and high-frequency ultrasonography in active lesions and normal control skin in patients with chronic eczema, psoriasis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea and parapsoriasis/mycosis fungoides. Using histological diagnosis as a gold standard, a decision tree analysis was performed based on the mean percentage changes of these parameters [(lesion-control/control) ×100] for differentiation of the diseases. Results: The accuracy of the decision tree model for differentiation of five diseases was 67% which developed based on changes in stratum corneum hydration, epidermal thickness, skin pH, melanin index, R0 (reciprocal of firmness) and erythema. Among the flowcharts for pairs of diseases, three models for differentiation had high accuracy (> 95%): those of psoriasis from lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, and parapsoriasis/mycosis fungoides. Limitations: Validation studies on a larger sample size in situations where the diagnosis is unclear are needed to confirm the accuracy and applicability of decision trees. Conclusion: Skin biophysical and ultrasonographic properties may help in the differentiation of papulosquamous diseases as simple and non-invasive tools. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Designing personalized treatment strategies for AD is challenging, given the apparent unpredictability and large variation in AD symptoms and treatment responses within and across individuals. Better prediction of AD severity over time for individual patients could help to select optimum timing and type of treatment for improving disease control. Objective: We aimed to develop a proof of principle mechanistic machine learning model that predicts the patient-specific evolution of AD severity scores on a daily basis. Methods: We designed a probabilistic predictive model and trained it using Bayesian inference with the longitudinal data from two published clinical studies. The data consisted of daily recordings of AD severity scores and treatments used by 59 and 334 AD children over 6 months and 16 weeks, respectively. Validation of the predictive model was conducted in a forward-chaining setting. Results: Our model was able to predict future severity scores at the individual level and improved chance-level forecast by 60%. Heterogeneous patterns in severity trajectories were captured with patient-specific parameters such as the short-term persistence of AD severity and responsiveness to topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors and step-up treatment. Conclusions: Our proof of principle model successfully predicted the daily evolution of AD severity scores at an individual level and could inform the design of personalized treatment strategies that can be tested in future studies. Our model-based approach can be applied to other diseases with apparent unpredictability and large variation in symptoms and treatment responses such as asthma. © 2020 The Authors.

Identifying and predicting this skin lesion in the early stage will escape the people from its severity and from its tribulation. Identifying the lesion in the starting stage will avoid the severity of the disease and make the people comfortable. In this paper we propose a deep convolution learning model which improves the identification of lesion in early stage. Moreover we have collected the dataset for nine different skin lesion each with 200 samples, totally 1800 images. The experiment shows the proposed model archives good results for the dataset from „DermNet dataset‟ for the skin lesions such as Acne, Basal Cell Carcinoma Lesion, Eczema, Impetigo, Melanoma, Rosacea, Molluscum Contagiosum, Psoriasis, and Vitiligo by assisting the dermatologist for the practical analysis of skin lesions by examining the dermoscopic or clinical images, which provides better near-human accuracy.

Objective: To develop a convolutional neural network model to classify clinically relevant selected multiple-lesion skin diseases, this in accordance to the STARD guidelines. Methods: This was an image-based retrospective study using multi-task learning for binary classification. A VGG-16 model was trained on 16,543 non-standardized images. Image data was distributed in training set (80%), validation set (10%), and test set (10%). All images were collected from a clinical database of a Danish population attending one dermatological department. Included was patients categorized with ICD-10 codes related to acne, rosacea, psoriasis, eczema, and cutaneous t-cell lymphoma. Results: Acne was distinguished from rosacea with a sensitivity of 85.42% CI 72.24–93.93% and a specificity of 89.53% CI 83.97–93.68%, cutaneous t-cell lymphoma was distinguished from eczema with a sensitivity of 74.29% CI 67.82–80.05% and a specificity of 84.09% CI 80.83–86.99%, and psoriasis from eczema with a sensitivity of 81.79% CI 78.51–84.76% and a specificity of 73.57% CI 69.76–77.13%. All results were based on the test set. Conclusion: The performance rates reported were equal or superior to those reported for general practitioners with dermatological training, indicating that computer-aided diagnostic models based on convolutional neural network may potentially be employed for diagnosing multiple-lesion skin diseases. © Copyright © 2020 Thomsen, Christensen, Iversen, Lomholt and Winther.","acne; cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL); deep neural network (DNN); dermatology; ezcema; psoriasis; rosacea; skin disease","Article; atopic dermatitis; binary classification; contact dermatitis; convolutional neural network; cutaneous T cell lymphoma; Denmark; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; eczema; feasibility study; human; ICD-10; information processing; k means clustering; major clinical study; practice guideline; predictive value; psoriasis; retrospective study; rosacea; sensitivity and specificity; skin defect; visual memory",,,,,,,,"Hay, R.J., Johns, N.E., Williams, H.C., Bolliger, I.W., Dellavalle, R.P., Margolis, D.J., The global burden of skin disease in 2010: an analysis of the prevalence and impact of skin conditions (2014) J Invest Dermatol, 134, pp. 1527-1534. , 24166134; Julian, C.G., Dermatology in general practice (1999) Br J Dermatol, 141, pp. 518-520. , 10583058; Verhoeven, E.W., Kraaimaat, F.W., van Weel, C., van de Kerkhof, P.C., Duller, P., van der Valk, P.G., Skin diseases in family medicine: prevalence and health care use (2008) Ann Fam Med, 6, pp. 349-354. , 18626035; DermNet, N.Z., (2019), http://www.dermnetnz.org/, Available online at:, (Accessed February 16, 2019; Federman, D.G., Kirsner, R.S., The abilities of primary care physicians in dermatology: implications for quality of care (2017) Am J Manag Care, 3, pp. 1487-1492. , 10178455; Barrett, M., Luu, M., Differential diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (2017) Immunol Allergy Clin North Am, 37, pp. 11-34. , 27886900; Feng, H., Berk-Krauss, J., Feng, P.W., Stein, J.A., Comparison of dermatologist density between urban and rural counties in the United States (2018) JAMA Dermatol, 154, pp. 1265-1271. , 30193349; Thomsen, K., Iversen, L., Titlestad, T.L., Winther, O., Systematic review of machine learning for diagnosis and prognosis in dermatology (2019) J Dermatol Treat, , 31625775; Brinker, T.J., Hekler, A., Enk, A.H., Klode, J., Hauschild, A., Berking, C., Deep learning outperformed 136 of 157 dermatologists in a head-to-head dermoscopic melanoma image classification task (2019) Eur J Cancer, 113, pp. 47-54. , 30981091; Esteva, A., Kuprel, B., Novoa, R.A., Ko, J., Swetter, S.M., Blau, H.M., Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks (2017) Nature, 542, pp. 115-118. , 28117445; Han, S.S., Park, G.H., Lim, W., Kim, M.S., Na, J.I., Park, I., Deep neural networks show an equivalent and often superior performance to dermatologists in onychomycosis diagnosis: Automatic construction of onychomycosis datasets by region-based convolutional deep neural network (2018) PLoS ONE, 13, p. e0191493. , 29352285; Liu, Y., Jain, A., Eng, C., Way, D.H., Lee, K., Bui, P., A deep learning system for differential diagnosis of skin diseases (2019) EESS, , 32424212, (,); Wu, H., Yin, H., Chen, H., Sun, M., Liu, X., Yu, Y., A deep learning, image based approach for automated diagnosis for inflammatory skin diseases (2020) Ann Transl Med, 8, p. 581. , 32566608; Kim, Y.J., Han, S.S., Yang, H.J., Chang, S.E., Prospective, comparative evaluation of a deep neural network and dermoscopy in the diagnosis of onychomycosis (2020) PLoS ONE, 15, p. e0234334. , 32525908; Tschandl, P., Rinner, C., Apalla, Z., Argenziano, G., Codella, N., Halpern, A., Human-computer collaboration for skin cancer recognition (2020) Nat Med, 26, pp. 1229-1234. , 32572267; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Adv Neural Inform Process Syst, 1, pp. 1097-1105; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition (2014) ICLR; Cohen, J.F., Korevaar, D.A., Altman, D.G., Bruns, D.E., Gatsonis, C.A., Hooft, L., STARD 2015 guidelines for reporting diagnostic accuracy studies: explanation and elaboration (2016) BMJ open, 6, p. e012799. , 28137831; Solomon, B.A., Collins, R., Silverberg, N.B., Glass, A.T., Quality of care: issue or oversight in health care reform?

As dermatology belongs to this field, it has the potential to play a pioneering role in the use of AI. Objective: The current use of AI for the diagnosis and follow-up of dermatoses is reviewed and the future potential of these technologies is discussed. Materials and methods: This article is based on a selective review of the literature using Embase and MEDLINE and the keywords “psoriasis”, “eczema”, “dermatoses” and “acne” combined with “artificial intelligence”, “machine learning”, “deep learning”, “neural network”, “computer-guided”, “supervised machine learning” or “unsupervised machine learning” were searched. Results: In comparison to examiner-dependent intra- and interindividually fluctuating scores for the assessment of inflammatory dermatoses (e.g. the Psoriasis Areas Severity Index [PASI] and body surface area [BSA]), AI-based algorithms can potentially offer reproducible, standardized evaluations of these scores. Whereas promising algorithms have already been developed for the diagnosis of psoriasis, there is currently only scarce work on the use of AI in the context of eczema. Conclusions: The latest developments in this field show the enormous potential of AI-based diagnostics and follow-up of dermatological clinical pictures by means of an autonomous computer-based image analysis. These noninvasive, optical examination methods provide valuable additional information, but dermatological interaction remains indispensable in daily clinical practice. © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","Algorithms;

Techniques within natural language processing, a field of artificial intelligence, can analyze large amounts of text information and extract insights. Objective: To apply natural language processing to Reddit comments about dermatology topics to assess for feasibility and potential for insights and engagement. Methods: A software pipeline preprocessed Reddit comments from 2005 to 2017 from 7 popular dermatology-related subforums on Reddit, applied latent Dirichlet allocation, and used spectral clustering to establish cohesive themes and the frequency of word representation and grouped terms within these topics. Results: We created a corpus of 176,000 comments and identified trends in patient engagement in spaces such as eczema and acne, among others, with a focus on homeopathic treatments and isotretinoin. Limitations: Latent Dirichlet allocation is an unsupervised model, meaning there is no ground truth to which the model output can be compared. However, because these forums are anonymous, there seems little incentive for patients to be dishonest. Conclusions: Reddit data has viability and utility for dermatologic research and engagement with the public, especially for common dermatology topics such as tanning, acne, and psoriasis. © 2019 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.","artificial intelligence; natural language processing; patient education; patient engagement; Reddit; social media","isotretinoin; acne; Article; comparative study; data analysis; dermatology; eczema; evaluation study; feasibility study; homeopathy; human; natural language processing; patient participation; priority journal",,"isotretinoin, 4759-48-2",,,,,,"Perrin, A., Social media usage, 2005-2015 (2015), http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/08/social-networking-usage-2005-2015/, Pew Research Center (Accessed 12 December 2018); Savas, J.A., Huang, K.E., Tuchayi, S.M., Feldman, S.R., Understanding the influence of social media in medicine: lesson learned from Facebook (2014) Dermatol Online J, 20 (9); Buntinx-Krieg, T., Caravaglio, J., Domozych, R., Dellavalle, R., Dermatology on Reddit: elucidating trends in dermatologic communications on the world wide web (2017) Dermatol Online J, 23 (7); Vance, K., Howe, W., Dellavalle, R.P., Social internet sites as a source of public health information (2009) Dermatol Clin, 27 (2), pp. 133-136; Nadkarni, P.M., Ohno-Machado, L., Chapman, W.W., Natural language processing: an introduction (2011) J Am Med Inform Assoc, 18 (5), pp. 544-551; Friedman, C., Hripcsak, G., Natural language processing and its future in medicine (1999) Acad Med, 74 (8), pp. 890-895; Hripcsak, G., Friedman, C., Alderson, P.O., Unlocking clinical data from narrative reports: a study of natural language processing (1995) Ann Intern Med, 122 (9), pp. 681-688; Sarker, A., Belousov, M., Friedrichs, J., Data and systems for medication-related text classification and concept normalization from Twitter: insights from the Social Media Mining for Health (SMM4H)-2017 shared task (2018) J Am Med Inform Assoc, 25 (10), pp. 1274-1283; Blumenthal, K.G., Topaz, M., Zhou, L., Mining social media data to assess the risk of skin and soft tissue infections from allergen immunotherapy (2019) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 144 (1), pp. 129-134; Lott, J.P., Boudreau, D.M., Barnhill, R.L., Population-based analysis of histologically confirmed melanocytic proliferations using natural language processing (2018) JAMA Dermatol, 154 (1), pp. 24-29; Menzies, S., Daly, S., McKenna, D., Social media and psoriasis treatment: what are people saying on Twitter?

The method proposed in this work detects four types of skin diseases using computer vision. The proposed approach involves Convolutional Neural Networks with specific focus on skin disease. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in this paper has utilized around 11 layers viz., Convolution Layer, Activation Layer, Pooling Layer, Fully Connected Layer and Soft-Max Classifier. Images from the DermNet database are used for validating the architecture. The database comprises all types of skin diseases out of which we have considered four different types of skin diseases like Acne, Keratosis, Eczema herpeticum, Urticaria with each class containing around 30 to 60 different samples. The challenges in automating the process includes the variation of skin tones, location of the disease, specifications of the image acquisition system etc., The proposed CNN Classifier results in an accuracy of 98.6% to 99.04%. © 2020","AlexNET; Convolution layer; Convolution neural network; Detection; Pooling; Skin disease","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Dermatology; Diagnosis; Error detection; Activation layer; AlexNET; Automatic diagnosis; Convolution neural network; Health issues; Image acquisition systems; Pooling; Skin disease; Multilayer neural networks",,,,,,,,"Foulongne, V., Merkel Cell Polomavirus DNA detection in lesional and non lesional skin from patients with Merkel cell carcinoma or other skin diseases (2010) Br.

Because of a shortage of dermatologists, most cases are seen instead by general practitioners with lower diagnostic accuracy. We present a deep learning system (DLS) to provide a differential diagnosis of skin conditions using 16,114 de-identified cases (photographs and clinical data) from a teledermatology practice serving 17 sites. The DLS distinguishes between 26 common skin conditions, representing 80% of cases seen in primary care, while also providing a secondary prediction covering 419 skin conditions. On 963 validation cases, where a rotating panel of three board-certified dermatologists defined the reference standard, the DLS was non-inferior to six other dermatologists and superior to six primary care physicians (PCPs) and six nurse practitioners (NPs) (top-1 accuracy: 0.66 DLS, 0.63 dermatologists, 0.44 PCPs and 0.40 NPs). These results highlight the potential of the DLS to assist general practitioners in diagnosing skin conditions. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,"acne; actinic keratosis; adult; alopecia areata; Article; basal cell carcinoma; convolutional neural network; cyst; deep learning; dermatologist; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; differential diagnosis; eczema; ethnicity; female; folliculitis; general practitioner; hidradenitis; human; lentigo; major clinical study; male; male type alopecia; melanoma; nurse practitioner; pigmented nevus; postinflammatory hyperpigmentation; priority journal; psoriasis; race difference; seborrheic dermatitis; seborrheic keratosis; sex difference; skin allergy; skin disease; squamous cell skin carcinoma; teleconsultation; teledermatology; tinea; tinea versicolor; urticaria; verruca vulgaris; vitiligo; acne vulgaris; African American; Alaska Native; American Indian; Asian American; Caucasian; Hispanic; middle aged; Oceanic ancestry group; photography; skin disease; skin tumor; squamous cell carcinoma; telemedicine; Acne Vulgaris; Adult; African Americans; Alaska Natives; Asian Americans; Carcinoma, Basal Cell; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Deep Learning; Dermatitis, Seborrheic; Dermatologists; Diagnosis, Differential; Eczema; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Folliculitis; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Indians, North American; Keratosis, Seborrheic; Male; Melanoma; Middle Aged; Nurse Practitioners; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Photography; Physicians, Primary Care; Psoriasis; Skin Diseases; Skin Neoplasms; Telemedicine; Warts",,,,,"Google","K.K. and S.J.H. were consultants of Google LLC.

AD). We examined the symptoms related to asthma and AD and the plasma levels of 72 cytokines/chemokines obtained from a general population of 161 children at 6 years of age who participated in a pilot birth cohort study of the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS). The children whose signs and symptoms fulfilled the criteria of AD, which are mostly based on questionnaire including past symptoms, tended to have higher levels of the two chemokine ligands, CCL17 and CCL27, which are used for diagnosis of AD. On the other hand, another AD-related chemokine CCL22 level in plasma was higher only in children with visible flexural eczema, which is one of AD diagnostic criteria but was judged on the same day of blood examination unlike other criteria. Here, we also developed an innovative method of machine learning for elucidating the complex cytokine/chemokine milieu related to symptoms of allergic diseases by using clustering analysis based on the random forest dissimilarity measure that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) technique. To our surprise, the majority of children showing at least any asthma-related symptoms during the last month were divided by AI into the two clusters, either cluster-2 having elevated levels of IL-33 (related to eosinophil activation) or cluster-3 having elevated levels of CXCL7/NAP2 (related to neutrophil activation), among the total three clusters. Future studies will clarify better approach for allergic diseases by endotype classification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Asthma; Atopic dermatitis; Child; Cohort study; Machine learning","chemokine; cutaneous T cell attracting chemokine; cytokine; macrophage derived chemokine; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; Article; artificial intelligence; asthma; atopic dermatitis; blood examination; child; clinical feature; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; eczema; exploratory research; female; human; leukocyte activation; machine learning; major clinical study; male; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor",,"thymus and activation regulated chemokine, 181532-29-6",,,"National Institute for Environmental Studies, NIES","The Japan Environment and Children's Study Pilot Study was funded by the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan.

It acts as a shield to protect our internal body to get damaged. But this important part of the human body can be affected by so serious infections caused by some fungus or viruses or even dust too. Around the world, millions of people suffer from various skin diseases. From acne problems to eczema people suffer a lot. Sometimes a small boil on the skin can turn into a severe issue or even an infection that will cause a major health issue. Some skin issues are so contagious that one can be affected by another just with a handshake or using a handkerchief. A proper diagnosis can result in proper medication that can reduce the miseries of the people suffering create awareness. In this research, we have tried to develop a prototype to detect skin diseases using neural networks. In the choice of neural networks, we have chosen CNN which abbreviates as a convolutional neural network. Earlier detection works have been done using DNN which is a deep neural network. Right now have classes to identify a typical skin malady called dermatitis hand, eczema hand, eczema subcute, lichen simplex, statis dermatitis and ulcers. This paper is a sandwich between picture handling strategies and machine learning. Where picture preparation has produced the picture which is being utilized by CNN to arrange the classes. The preparation information comprises five classes of the skin gives that have been talked about above. We have 73% precision by actualizing our framework on the dermnet dataset of 500 pictures of various diseases. This will end up being an incredible achievement if the further enhancements are finished utilizing a bigger measure of the dataset. © 2020 IEEE.","CNN; DNN; image processing; Skin disease","Control systems; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Dermatology; Diagnosis; Intelligent computing; Man machine systems; Viruses; Health issues; Human bodies; Skin disease; Convolutional neural networks",,,,,,,,"Eczema:Symptoms,Treatment and Causes, , https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/14417, [Online; Paris, S., A gentle introduction to bilateral filtering and it s applications (2007) ACM SIGGRAPH 2007 Courses, p. 3; Zakaria, Z., Isa, N.A.M., Suandi, S.A., A study on neural network training algorithm for multiface detection in static images (2010) Interna Tional Journal of Computer and Information Engineering, 4 (2), pp. 345-348; Esteva, A., Kuprel, B., Novoa, R.A., Ko, J., Swetter, S.M., Blau, H.M., Thrun, S., Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks (2017) Nature, 542 (7639), pp. 115-118; Bindhu, V., Biomedical image analysis using semantic segmentation (2019) Journal of Innovative Image Processing (JIIP), 1 (2), pp. 91-101; Vijayakumar, T., Comparative study of capsule neural network in various applications (2019) Journal of Artificial Intelligence, 1 (1), pp. 19-27; Liao, H., (2016) A Deep Learning Approach to Universal Skin Disease Classification, , University of Rochester Department of Computer Science, CSC; Pal, A., Chaturvedi, A., Garain, U., Chandra, A., Chatterjee, R., Severity grading of psoriatic plaques using deep CNN based multi-task learning (2016) 2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recog Nition (ICPR, pp. 1478-1483. , IEEE; Balestrieri, E., Lamonaca, F., Lembo, S., Miele, G., Cusano, F., De Cristofaro, G.A., Automatic psoriasis assessment methods: Current sce-nario and perspectives from a metrologic point of view (2019) 2019 IEEE International Symposium on Medica L Measurements and Applications (MeMeA), pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Ge, Z., Demyanov, S., Chakravorty, R., Bowling, A., Garnavi, R., Skin disease recognition using deep saliency features and multimodal learning of dermoscopy and clinical images (2017) International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, pp. 250-258. , Springer; Qin, Z., Zhang, M., Detection of rice sheath blight for in-season disease management using multispectral remote sensing (2005) International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 7 (2), pp. 115-128; Meunkaewjinda, A., Kumsawat, P., Attakitmongcol, K., Srikaew, A., Grape leaf disease detection from color imagery using hybrid intelligent system (2008) 2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electro Nics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology, 1, pp. 513-516. , IEEE; Generating Ngrams (Unigrams,Bigrams Etc) from a Large Corpus Of.Txt Files and Their Frequency, , https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32441605/generating-ngrams-unigrams-bigrams-etc-from-A-large-corpus-of-txt-files-And-t, [Online; Kurniawati, N.N., Abdullah, S.N.H.S., Abdullah, S., Abdullah, S., Investigation on image processing techniques for diagnosing paddy diseases (2009) 2009 International Conference of Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition, pp. 272-277. , IEEE; Convolutional Neural Network, , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional-neural-network, [Online; Neural Networks, , https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks, [Online; Rathod, J., Wazhmode, V., Sodha, A., Bhavathankar, P., Diagnosis of skin diseases using convolutional neural networks (2018) 2018 Second International Confere Nce on Electronics, Communication and A Erospace Technology (ICECA, pp. 1048-1051. , IEEE; Wu, Z., Zhao, S., Peng, Y., He, X., Zhao, X., Huang, K., Wu, X., Chen, M., Studies on different CNN algorithms for face skin disease classification based on clinical images (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 66505-66511",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2020 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems, ICICCS 2020","13 May 2020 through 15 May 2020",,161336,,9781728148762,,,"English","Proc.

Using the cloud services and CNN, a real-time mobile-enabled skin lesions classification expert system “i-Rash” is proposed and developed. i-Rash aimed at early diagnosis of acne, eczema and psoriasis at remote locations. The classification model used in the “i-Rash” is developed using the CNN model “SqueezeNet”. The transfer learning approach is used for training the classification model and model is trained and tested on 1856 images. The benefit of using SqueezeNet results in a limited size of the trained model i.e. only 3 MB. For classifying new image, cloud-based architecture is used, and the trained model is deployed on a server. A new image is classified in fractions of seconds with overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 97.21%, 94.42% and 98.14% respectively. i-Rash can serve in initial classification of skin lesions, hence, can play a very important role early classification of skin lesions for people living in remote areas. © 2020 by the author(s).","Convolution neural network acne classification; Deep learning; Eczema classification; Mobile-enabled skin lesion classification; Psoriasis classification; Skin lesions classification; SqueezeNet",,,,,,,,,"Hameed, N., Hassan, K.

Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of our handheld CRS system and propose a novel quantitative index to measure skin barrier function. Methods: This prospective study included 30 atopic dermatitis (AD) patients and 14 healthy volunteers. All AD participants were assessed using the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) severity instrument, a vapometer for trans-epidermal water loss and a moisture meter for skin surface moisture. A handheld CRS operating at 785 nm laser was used to measure the biochemical constituents of the skin up to a depth of ∼100 μm. We trained a linear kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) model for eczema classification based on the water, ceramide and urocanic acid content. A novel Eczema Biochemical Index (EBI) was then formulated using the skin constituents measured from the AD participants to stage disease severity. Results: The SVM model used to classify healthy participants and AD patients obtained high cross-validated area under the curve of 0.857 and accuracy of 0.841, with high sensitivity and specificity values of 0.857 and 0.833 respectively. EBI can be used to stratify AD patients of varying severity, based on the biochemical constituents in the skin. Conclusion: As compared to the standard CRS system, the handheld CRS offers higher portability and provides Raman measurements at various body regions with similar sensitivity. This suggests that a handheld CRS device could be a valuable point-of-care resource in both research and clinical use. © 2020 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology","Atopic dermatitis; Eczema; Imaging; Raman spectroscopy","adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; clinical article; cohort analysis; confocal Raman spectrometry; controlled study; disease classification; disease severity; eczema; Eczema Biochemical Index; feasibility study; female; human; male; priority journal; prospective study; quantitative analysis; Raman spectrometry; Scoring Atopic Dermatitis; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; skin function; skin surface; support vector machine; water loss",,,,,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR","Authors would like to thank B iomedical Research Council (BMRC) , A*STAR, Singapore for the intramural funding support for this study.

Several skin abnormalities were not identified properly from statistics. The skin cancer detection is depended on texture variation of a specific location of skin. It is very difficult to recognize the malignant skin texture in the presence of common deformity viz., sunburns, eczema. So, in this paper, it has been proposed to detect melanoma from the dermoscopic patterns with skin cancer data set. The watershed segmentation technique is applied and segments are extracted that are subjected to features. The features extracted are classified using J48 and (RFC) Random forest classifiers and acquire best outcomes for skin lesions. © 2020 IEEE.","Classification; J48; Melanoma; Segmentation; Tree Random Forest","Decision trees; Diseases; Random forests; Textures; Malignant skin; Random forest classifier; Skin cancers; Skin lesion; Specific location; Texture variation; Watershed segmentation technique; Dermatology",,,,,,,,"Murugan, A., Anu, S., Nair, H., Sanal Kumar, K.P., Detection of skin cancer using svm, random forest and knn classifiers (2019) Journal of Medical Systems, , Springer, July; Thanh, H.D.N., Erkan, U., Surya Prasanth, V.B., Kumar, V., Ngoc Hien, N., A skin lesion segmentation method for dermoscopic images on adaptive thresholding with normalization of color models (2019) 6th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ICEEE); Do, T., Hoang, T., Pomponiu, V., Zhou, Y., Chen, Z., Cheung, N., Koh, D., Tan, S., Accessible melanoma detection using smartphones and mobile image analysis (2018) IEEE Transactional on Multimedia, 20 (10). , October; Yuan, Y., Chao, M., Lo, Y., Automatic skin lesion segmentation using deep fully convolutional networks with jaccard distance (2017) IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 36 (9). , September; Jafari, M.H., Karimi, N., Nasir-Esfahani, E., Sarnavi, S., Soroushmehr, S.M.R., Ward, K., Najarian, K., Skin lesion segmentation in clinical images using deep learning (2016) 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognitional (ICPR), , December; Ahn, E., Kim, J., Bi, L., Kumar, A., Li, C., Fulham, M., Dagan Feng, D., Saliency-based lesion segmentation via background detection in dermoscopic images (2017) IEEE Joural of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 21 (6). , November; Liao, H., A deep learning approach to universal skin disease classification (2016) CSC 400-Graduate Problem Seminar-project Report; Mahagaonkar, R.S., Soma, S., A novel texture based skin melanoma detection using color glcm and cs-lbp feature (2017) International Journal of Computer Applications (0975-8887), 171 (5). , August; Mishra, N.K., Celebi, E., (2016) An Overview of Melanoma Detection in Dermoscopy Images Using Image Processing and Machine Learning, , January; Ghanta, S., Jordan, M.I., Kose, K., Brooks, D.H., Rajadhyaksha, M., Dy, J.G., A marked poisson process driven latent shape model for 3d segmentation of reflectance confocal microscopy image stacks of human skin (2017) IEEE Transactional on Image Processing, 26 (1). , January; Fu, Y., Huang, Z., He, H., Ma, H., Wu, J., Flexible 3. 3 mueller matrix endoscope prototype for cancer detection (2018) IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 67 (7). , July; Madooei, A., Drew, M.S., Hajimirsadehi, H., Learning to detect blue-white structures in dermoscopy images with weak supervision (2019) IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 23 (2). , March; Murugaiyan Jaisakthi, S., Mirunalini, P., Aravindan, C., Automated skin lesion segmentation of dermoscopic images using grabcut and k-means algorithms (2018) IET Comput.

In the United Kingdom alone, 60% of the population suffer from skin diseases during their lifetime. In this paper, we propose an intelligent digital diagnosis scheme to improve the classification accuracy of multiple diseases. A Multi-Class Multi-Level (MCML) classification algorithm inspired by the “divide and conquer” rule is explored to address the research challenges. The MCML classification algorithm is implemented using traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning approaches. Improved techniques are proposed for noise removal in the traditional machine learning approach. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on 3672 classified images, collected from different sources and the diagnostic accuracy of 96.47% is achieved. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, its metrics are compared with the Multi-Class Single-Level classification algorithm which is the main algorithm used in most of the existing literature. The results also indicate that the MCML classification algorithm is capable of enhancing the classification performance of multiple skin lesions. © 2019","Computer-aided diagnosise; Deep learning; Eczema classification; Machine learning; Melanoma classification; Skin lesion classification; Texture & colour features","Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Deep learning; Dermatology; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Textures; Classification performance; Colour features; Computer aided; Disability adjusted life years; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Multi-level classifications; Skin lesion; Machine learning",,,,,"2013-32541/001001","This research work is funded by Erasmus Mundus Fusion (Featured Europe and South asIa Mobility Network) project Grant reference number: 2013-32541/001001 .

Insights into the diversity and frequency of transcripts in healthy and diseased conditions provide valuable information on the cellular status in the respective tissues. Growing with the technique, the bioinformatic analysis toolkit reveals biologically relevant pathways which assist in understanding basic pathophysiological mechanisms. Conventional classification systems of inflammatory skin diseases rely on descriptive assessments by pathologists. In contrast to this, molecular profiling may uncover previously unknown disease classifying features. Thereby, treatments and prognostics of patients may be improved. Furthermore, disease models in basic research in comparison to the human disease can be directly validated. The aim of this article is not only to provide the reader with information on the opportunities of these techniques, but to outline potential pitfalls and technical limitations as well. Major published findings are briefly discussed to provide a broad overview on the current findings in transcriptomics in inflammatory skin diseases. © 2020 by the authors.

Managing hand eczema is particularly challenging for primary care and occupational health physicians as the condition has varying causes and both disease progression and response to treatment are difficult to predict. Early diagnosis and appropriate protective measures are essential to prevent progression to chronic eczema, which is much more difficult to treat. Appropriate referral to a specialist and opportune evaluation of the need for sick leave are crucial to the good management of these patients. These guidelines cover the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of chronic hand eczema and highlight the role that primary care and occupational health physicians can play in the early management of this disease. © 2019 AEDV","Chronic eczema; Dermatitis; Diagnosis; Emollients; General practitioners; Hands; Referral criteria; Topical corticosteroids","Article; early intervention; general practitioner; hand eczema; human; occupational physician; practice guideline; algorithm; decision tree; eczema; hand disease; practice guideline; Algorithms; Decision Trees; Eczema; Hand Dermatoses; Humans",,,,,,"Los autores agradecen el apoyo de Francisco L?pez de Saro en la redacci?n y la edici?n de este manuscrito.",,"Thyssen, J.P., Johansen, J.D., Linneberg, A., Menne, T., The epidemiology of hand eczema in the general population — prevalence and main findings (2010) Contact Dermatitis., 62, pp. 75-87; Alfonso, J.H., Bauer, A., Bensefa-Colas, L., Boman, A., Bubas, M., Constandt, L., Minimum standards on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of occupational and work-related skin diseases in Europe — Position paper of the cost action standerm (TD 1206) (2017) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol., 31, pp. 31-43; Diepgen, T.L., Andersen, K.E., Chosidow, O., Coenraads, P.J., Elsner, P., English, J., Guidelines for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of hand eczema (2015) J Dtsch Dermatol Ges., 13, pp. e1-e22; Lynde, C., Guenther, L., Diepgen, T.L., Sasseville, D., Poulin, Y., Gulliver, W., Canadian hand dermatitis management guidelines (2010) J Cutan Med Surg., 14, pp. 267-284; Menne, T., Johansen, J.D., Sommerlund, M., Veien, N.K., Hand eczema guidelines based on the Danish guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hand eczema (2011) Contact Dermatitis., 65, pp. 3-12; Coenraads, P.J., Hand eczema (2012) N Engl J Med., 36719, pp. 1829-1837; Diepgen, T.L., Agner, T., Aberer, W., Berth-Jones, J., Cambazard, F., Elsner, P., Management of chronic hand eczema (2007) Contact Dermatitis., 57, pp. 203-210; Vindenes, H.K., Svanes, C., Lygre, S.H.L., Hollund, B.E., Langhammer, A., Bertelsen, R.J., Prevalence of, and work-related risk factors for, hand eczema in a Norwegian general population (the Hunt Study) (2017) Contact Dermatitis., 77, pp. 214-223; Gronhagen, C.M., Liden, C., Bergstrom, A., Kull, I., Wahlgren, C.F., Meding, B., Prevalence and incidence of hand eczema in adolescence: Report from BAMSE — a population-based birth cohort (2014) Br J Dermatol., 1713, pp. 609-614; Johannisson, A., Ponten, A., Svensson, A., Prevalence, incidence and predictive factors for hand eczema in young adults — a follow-up study (2013) BMC Dermatol., 13, p. 14; Mortz, C.G., Bindslev-Jensen, C., Andersen, K.E., Hand eczema in the odense adolescence cohort study on atopic diseases and dermatitis (TOACS): Prevalence, incidence and risk factors from adolescence to adulthood (2014) Br J Dermatol., 1712, pp. 313-323; Scalone, L., Cortesi, P.A., Mantovani, L.G., Belisari, A., Ayala, F., Fortina, A.B., Clinical epidemiology of hand eczema in patients accessing dermatological reference centres: Results from Italy (2015) Br J Dermatol., 1721, pp. 187-195; Apfelbacher, C., Molin, S., Weisshaar, E., Bauer, A., Elsner, P., Mahler, V., Characteristics and provision of care in patients with chronic hand eczema: Updated data from the carpe registry (2014) Acta Derm Venereol., 94, pp. 163-167; Minamoto, K., Watanabe, T., Diepgen, T.L., Self-reported hand eczema among dental workers in Japan — a cross-sectional study (2016) Contact Dermatitis., 75, pp. 230-239; Brans, R., Kolomanski, K., Mentzel, F., Vollmer, U., Kaup, O., John, S.M., Colonisation with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and associated factors among nurses with occupational skin diseases (2016) Occup Environ Med., 7310, pp. 670-675; Heede, N.G., Thyssen, J.P., Thuesen, B.H., Linneberg, A., Johansen, J.D., Predictive factors of self-reported hand eczema in adult danes: A population-based cohort study with 5-year follow-up (2016) Br J Dermatol., 1752, pp. 287-295; Gronhagen, C., Liden, C., Wahlgren, C.F., Ballardini, N., Bergstrom, A., Kull, I., Hand eczema and atopic dermatitis in adolescents: A prospective cohort study from the BAMSE project (2015) Br J Dermatol., 1735, pp. 1175-1182; Lee, S.W., Cheong, S.H., Byun, J.Y., Choi, Y.W., Choi, H.Y., Occupational hand eczema among nursing staffs in korea: Self-reported hand eczema and contact sensitization of hospital nursing staffs (2013) J Dermatol., 40, pp. 182-187; Ibler, K.S., Jemec, G.B., Flyvholm, M.A., Diepgen, T.L., Jensen, A., Agner, T., Hand eczema: Prevalence and risk factors of hand eczema in a population of 2274 healthcare workers (2012) Contact Dermatitis., 67, pp. 200-207; Ortiz-Salvador, J.M., Subiabre-Ferrer, D., Garcia Rabasco, A., Esteve-Martinez, A., Zaragoza-Ninet, V., Alegre de Miquel, V., [Hand eczema in children.

It uses artificial intelligence algorithms like convolutional neural networks and support vector machines algorithm for classifying the images, and back propagation algorithm for training a model based on the symptoms.

With these generic issues in mind, we explore the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to three different types of images showing full hands, skin lesions, and varying degrees of eczema. A first model generates realistic images of all three types with a focus on the technical application of data augmentation. A perceptual study conducted with laypeople confirms that generated skin images cannot be distinguished from real data. Next, we propose models to add eczema lesions to healthy skin, respectively to remove eczema from patient skin using segmentation masks in a supervised learning setting. Such models allow to leverage existing unrelated skin pictures and enable non-technical applications, e.g. in aesthetic dermatology. Finally, we combine both models for eczema addition and removal in an entirely unsupervised process based on CycleGAN without relying on ground truth annotations anymore.

Aims: The basic aim of our study is to develop an automated system for skin disease classification that can help a general physician to automatically detect the lesion and classify it to disease types. Method: The performance of the proposed approach is corroborated by extensive experiments performed on a dataset of 588 images containing 6907 lesion regions. Results: The results show that the proposed methodology can be effectively used to construct a skin disease classification system. Conclusion: Our proposed method is designed for a specific skin tone. Future investigation is needed to analyze the impact of different skin tones on the performance of lesions detection and classification system. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.","Artificial neural network; Classification; Lesion; Medical abnormalities; Skin disease; Ultraviolet (UV) rays","acne; Article; artificial neural network; classification algorithm; classifier; computer assisted diagnosis; cross validation; data base; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; eczema; false negative result; false positive result; feature extraction; feature selection; human; image processing; image segmentation; major clinical study; psoriasis; receiver operating characteristic; scabies; skin color; skin disease; tinea corporis; vitiligo",,,,,,"We would like to thank Mr. Adnan Feroz and his team for providing us the dataset.",,"Hay, R.J., Johns, N.E., Williams, H.C., The global burden of skin disease in 2010: An analysis of the prevalence and impact of skin conditions (2014) J Invest Dermatol, 134 (6), pp. 1527-1534. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jid.2013.446, PMID: 24166134; Ascierto, P.A., Palmieri, G., Celentano, E., Sensitivity and specificity of epiluminescence microscopy: Evaluation on a sample of 2731 excised cutaneous pigmented lesions.

It has been observed in a study that every year the percentage of global population suffering from skin diseases is 1.79%. These diseases have a potential to become extremely dangerous if they are not treated in the nascent stages. It is extremely important that skin diseases are detected and diagnosed at the starting stages so that serious risks to life are avoided. Often, exhaustive tests are required so as to arrive on a conclusion regarding skin condition, the patient may be affected with. Thus, an expert system is required that has the ability to identify diseases and propose the required diagnosis. Presently, only a few solutions are available for diagnosis of skin diseases using computerized system but this is an era which is under extensive research and can be developed further. As the existing system has certain loopholes, this system attempts to override the present problems by applying a different approach. As a result of comparison of results from numerous research papers, an expert system has been developed by choosing residual neural networks (ResNet) and this system can be used to aid skin specialists in identifying and diagnosing various major diseases of skin like (Eczema, Psoriasis & Lichen Planus, Benign Tumors, Fungal Infections and Viral Infections) in more effective and efficient manner. The causes for identified skin disease can be outlined through this system and treatment can be provided. We have used Python language for implementing the proposed expert system that uses a 50-layer ResNets for training a dataset that has been taken from DERMNET. We achieved an accuracy of 95% using ResNet for training of the model and prediction of results at an epoch value of 10. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","convolutional neural networks (ConvNets); Expert systems; Python; residual neural networks (ResNets); skin; skin diseases",,,,,,,,,"Kumar, M., Kumar, R., An intelligent system to diagnose skin disease (2016) ARPN J.

During skin disease identification, the dermatologist requires a high level of expertise and accuracy. This study proposes different kinds of skin image feature extraction and classification methods. In this work, we have chosen six kinds of skin diseases such as melanoma, seborrheic keratosis, eczema, actinic keratoses, nevus, and lupus erythematosus. In the preprocessing stage, the color standardization is performed by gray world color constancy (GWCC) algorithm. The thick and thin hairs from the disease images are removed in the preprocessing stage. The circular kernel with morphological operation clearly segments the skin lesion region. Moreover, the combination of novel cumulative-based level difference mean (NCLDM) and improved Asymmetry, Border Irregularity, Color Variation and Diameter (ABCD) features vector (ABCD-fv) methods is more helpful to extract the shape, texture, and color feature of skin lesion. However, the more features never offer an accurate classification result, so we go for the ranking and selection of features. Finally, the improved gray wolf-based multiple-layer perceptron (IGWO-MLP) technique is used to produce the relevant skin disease class. For the experimentation, there are six datasets such as DermNet, Xiangya, Medicine Net, PH2, Kaggle, and HAM-10000, which are chosen for effective skin disease identification. The proposed method demonstrates better segmentation, feature extraction, and classification result in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, Jaccard similarity index, and Dice similarity index. As a result, the skin disease identification of the proposed IGWO-MLP method yields 98% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 98% Jaccard Similarity Index, and 99% Dice similarity index when compared with state-of-the-art methods. This work will certainly help dermatologists to make their work more efficient and help them to provide the correct treatment for the skin disease detected. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","dataset and classification;

They are complex, multifactorial, and are caused by a variety of different mechanisms, which result in multiple heterogeneous clinical phenotypes. Atopic march is usually interpreted as the sequential development of symptoms from eczema in infancy, to asthma, and then allergic rhinitis. Areas covered: The authors reviewed the evidence on the multimorbidity of eczema, asthma, and rhinitis, and the implication of results of data-driven analyses on the concept framework of atopic march. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles published until July 2020. Application of Bayesian machine learning framework to rich phenotypic data from birth cohorts demonstrated that the postulated linear progression of symptoms (atopic march) does not capture the heterogeneity of allergic phenotypes. Expert opinion: Eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis co-exist more often than would be expected by chance, but their relationship can be best understood in a multimorbidity framework, rather than through atopic march sequence. The observation of their co-occurrence does not imply any specific relationship between them, and certainly not a progressive or causal one. It is unlikely that a sngle mechanism such as allergic sensitization underpins different multimorbidity manifestations. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","allergic rhinitis; allergic sensitization; asthma; atopic march; eczema; machine learning; personalized medicine",,,,,,,"This paper was not funded.",,"Johansson, S.G., Bieber, T., Dahl, R., Revised nomenclature for allergy for global use: Report of the Nomenclature Review Committee of the World Allergy Organization, October 2003 (2004) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 113, pp. 832-836; Oksel, C., Custovic, A., Development of allergic sensitization and its relevance to paediatric asthma (2018) Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol, 18, pp. 109-116; Dharmage, S.C., Perret, J.L., Custovic, A., Epidemiology of Asthma in Children and Adults (2019) Front Pediatr, 7, p. 246; Custovic, A., Henderson, J., Simpson, A., Does understanding endotypes translate to better asthma management options for all?

In order to increase the survival rate, one needs to provide the appropriate treatment early on. To this end, one crucial step for specialists is the evaluation of histopathological slides (glass slides), or Whole Slide Images (WSI), of the patients’ skin tissue. We introduce a deep learning aided diagnostics tool that brings a two-fold value to the decision process of pathologists. First, our algorithm accurately segments WSI into regions that are relevant for an accurate diagnosis, achieving a Mean-IoU of and a Matthews Correlation score of on a novel dataset. Additionally, we also show that our model is competitive with the state of the art on a reference dataset. Second, using the segmentation map and the original image, we are able to predict if a patient has MF or Eczema. We created two models that can be applied in different stages of the diagnostic pipeline, potentially eliminating life-threatening mistakes. The classification outcome is considerably more interpretable than using only the WSI as the input, since it is also based on the segmentation map. Our segmentation model, which we call EU-Net, extends a classical U-Net with an EfficientNet-B7 encoder which was pre-trained on the Imagenet dataset. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Classification; Cutaneous lymphoma; Eczema; EfficientNet; Histopathological slides; Semantic segmentation; Transfer learning; U-Net","Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image analysis; Image understanding; Medical imaging; Semantics; Cutaneous lymphoma; Decision process; Diagnostics tools; Different stages; Segmentation models; Semantic segmentation; State of the art; Whole slide images; Image segmentation",,,,,,"We would like to thank everybody at the Kempf und Pfaltz Histologische Diagnostik lab that provided crucial insights about the task, all the necessary data and for their time and commitment to this collaboration.

However, the lack of attention on engagement aspects of mobile healthcare applications often result in users choosing to uninstall the application after the first usage experience. This results in failure of effective prolonged personalised healthcare, especially for users with chronic disease related to weather conditions such as asthma and eczema which require long-term monitoring and self-care. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the pattern of application user engagement with a weather-based mobile healthcare application through cohort retention analysis. Enhancement features for improving the engagement of personalised healthcare can provide meaningful insight. The proposed application allows the patient to conduct disease control tests to check the severity of their condition on a daily basis. To measure the application engagement, we distribute the mobile application designed for primary testing over a period of ten days. Based on the primary testing, data related to retention rate and the number of control test reported were collected via Firebase Analytic to determine the application engagement. Subsequently, we apply cohort analysis using a machine learning clustering technique implemented in Python to identify the pattern of the engagement by application users. Finally, useful insights were analysed and implemented as enhancement features within the application for improving the personalised weather-based mobile healthcare. The findings in this paper can assist machine learning facilitators design effective use policies for weather-based mobile healthcare with fundamental knowledge enhanced with personalisation and user engagement. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Intelligent management information systems; Mobile devices; Mobile intelligence; Personalisation; Weather based healthcare","Disease control; Diseases; Machine learning; Turing machines; Chronic disease; Cohort analysis; Health care application; Health condition; Long term monitoring; Mobile applications; Personalisation; Usage experience; mHealth",,,,,"FRGS/1/2019/SS06/MMU/02/4","Acknowledgments.

AD severity is primarily evaluated based on visual inspections by clinicians, but is subjective and has large inter- and intra-observer variability in many clinical study settings. To aid the standardisation and automating the evaluation of AD severity, this paper introduces a CNN computer vision pipeline, EczemaNet, that first detects areas of AD from photographs and then makes probabilistic predictions on the severity of the disease. EczemaNet combines transfer and multitask learning, ordinal classification, and ensembling over crops to make its final predictions. We test EczemaNet using a set of images acquired in a published clinical trial, and demonstrate low RMSE with well-calibrated prediction intervals. We show the effectiveness of using CNNs for non-neoplastic dermatological diseases with a medium-size dataset, and their potential for more efficiently and objectively evaluating AD severity, which has greater clinical relevance than mere classification. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Eczema; Multitask; Uncertainty","Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; Dermatitis; Forecasting; Learning systems; Multi-task learning; Transfer learning; Atopic dermatitis; Calibrated prediction; Clinical trial; Dermatological disease; Intra-observer variability; Ordinal classification; Probabilistic prediction; Visual inspection; Medical imaging",,,,,,,,"Abadi, M., TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning (2016) USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, pp. 265-283; Alam, M.N., Munia, T.T.K., Tavakolian, K., Vasefi, F., Mackinnon, N., Fazel-Rezai, R., Automatic detection and severity measurement of eczema using image processing (2016) EMBC, pp. 1365-1368. , IEEE; Ashukha, A., Lyzhov, A., Molchanov, D., Vetrov, D., Pitfalls of in-domain uncertainty estimation and ensembling in deep learning (2020) International Conference on Learning Representations; Berth-Jones, J., Six area, six sign atopic dermatitis (SASSAD) severity score: A simple system for monitoring disease activity in atopic dermatitis (1996) Br.

Research to understand these phenotypes has previously been based on longitudinal wheeze patterns or hypothesis-driven observational criteria. The aim of this study was to use data-driven machine learning to identify asthma and wheeze phenotypes in children based on symptom and symptom history data, and, to further characterize these phenotypes. The study population included an asthma-rich population of twins in Sweden aged 9-15 years (n = 752). Latent class analysis using current and historical clinical symptom data generated asthma and wheeze phenotypes. Characterization was then performed with regression analyses using diagnostic data: lung function and immunological biomarkers, parent-reported medication use and risk-factors. The latent class analysis identified four asthma/wheeze phenotypes: early transient wheeze (15%); current wheeze/asthma (5%); mild asthma (9%), moderate asthma (10%) and a healthy phenotype (61%). All wheeze and asthma phenotypes were associated with reduced lung function and risk of hayfever compared to healthy. Children with mild and moderate asthma phenotypes were also more likely to have eczema, allergic sensitization and a family history of asthma. Furthermore, those with moderate asthma phenotype had a higher eosinophil concentration (β 0.21, 95%CI 0.12, 0.30) compared to healthy and used short-term relievers at a higher rate than children with mild asthma phenotype (RR 2.4, 95%CI 1.2-4.9). In conclusion, using a data driven approach we identified four wheeze/asthma phenotypes which were validated with further characterization as unique from one another and which can be adapted for use by the clinician or researcher. © 2019 Brew et al.

Objectives: Discussion of current diagnostic possibilities for hand eczema; presentation and critical evaluation of proposed biomarkers for molecular diagnostics and outlook how diagnostics in dermatology will change in the near future. Materials and methods: In this article, we discuss basic research and provide a review of the literature. Results: Molecular diagnostics has the potential to substantially improve diagnosis of hand eczema; prerequisites are prospective validation of proposed markers and availability of valid and cost-effective diagnostics. Conclusions: In the near future, the diagnosis of hand eczema will be complemented by software algorithms and artificial intelligence on the one hand and simple, precise, and economic molecular diagnostic devices on the other. © 2019, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Biomarkers; Classifier; Personalized medicine; Software algorithms","hand eczema; Review; algorithm; artificial intelligence; dermatology; eczema; hand disease; human; molecular pathology; personalized medicine; software; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Dermatology; Eczema; Hand Dermatoses; Humans; Pathology, Molecular; Precision Medicine; Software",,,,,,,,"Eyerich, K., Eyerich, S., Immune response patterns in non-communicable inflammatory skin diseases (2018) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 32 (5), pp. 692-703. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BC1M7ovFCiuw%3D%3D, PID: 29114938; Traidl, C., Sebastiani, S., Albanesi, C., Disparate cytotoxic activity of nickel-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets against keratinocytes (2000) J Immunol, 165 (6), pp. 3058-3064. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3cXmslynsb8%3D, PID: 10975816; Dhingra, N., Shemer, A., Correa da Rosa, J., Molecular profiling of contact dermatitis skin identifies allergen-dependent differences in immune response (2014) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 134 (2), pp. 362-372. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXnt1ehtbo%3D, PID: 24768652; Eyerich, K., Brown, S.J., Perez White, B.E., Human and computational models of atopic dermatitis: A review and perspectives by an expert panel of the International Eczema Council (2019) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 143 (1), pp. 36-45. , PID: 30414395; Blauvelt, A., de Bruin-Weller, M., Gooderham, M., Long-term management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis with dupilumab and concomitant topical corticosteroids (LIBERTY AD CHRONOS): A 1-year, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (2017) Lancet, 389 (10086), pp. 2287-2303. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2sXnt1Cku7s%3D, PID: 28478972; Eyerich, S., Metz, M., Bossios, A., Eyerich, K., New biological treatments for asthma and skin allergies (2019) Allergy, , PMID: 31444793 [Epub ahead of print; Oosterhaven, J.A.F., Voorberg, A.N., Romeijn, G.L.E., de Bruin-Weller, M.S., Schuttelaar, M.L.A., Effect of dupilumab on hand eczema in patients with atopic dermatitis: An observational study (2019) J Dermatol; Umezawa, Y., Ito, K., Nakagawa, H., Palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis in a rheumatoid arthritis patient after treatment with adalimumab (2013) Eur J Dermatol, 23 (6), pp. 910-911. , PID: 24201093; Sladden, M.J., Sladden, C.S., Gulliver, W.P.F., Secukinumab-induced psoriasiform eruption (2017) JAMA Dermatol, 153 (11), pp. 1194-1195. , PID: 28768308; Kolesnik, M., Franke, I., Lux, A., Quist, S.R., Gollnick, H.P., Eczema in psoriatico: An important differential diagnosis between chronic allergic contact dermatitis and psoriasis in palmoplantar localization (2018) Acta Derm Venereol, 98 (1), pp. 50-58. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC1MXkt1Wjtbs%3D, PID: 28853491; Cesinaro, A.M., Nannini, N., Migaldi, M., Pepe, P., Maiorana, A., Psoriasis vs allergic contact dermatitis in palms and soles: A quantitative histologic and immunohistochemical study (2009) APMIS, 117 (8), pp. 629-634. , PID: 19664135; Oosterhaven, J.A.F., Uter, W., Aberer, W., European Surveillance System on Contact Allergies (ESSCA): Contact allergies in relation to body sites in patients with allergic contact dermatitis (2019) Contact Dermatitis, 80 (5), pp. 263-272; Diepgen, T.L., Elsner, P., Schliemann, S., Guideline on the management of hand eczema ICD-10 Code: L20.

Skin diseases are among the top 5 leading cause of the worldwide disease burden. To reduce this burden, computer-aided diagnosis systems (CAD) are highly demanded. Single disease classification is the major shortcoming in the existing work. Due to the similar characteristics of skin diseases, classification of multiple skin lesions is very challenging. This research work is an extension of our existing work where a novel classification scheme is proposed for multi-class classification. The proposed classification framework can classify an input skin image into one of the six non-overlapping classes i.e., healthy, acne, eczema, psoriasis, benign and malignant melanoma. The proposed classification framework constitutes four steps, i.e., pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. Different image processing and machine learning techniques are used to accomplish each step. 10-fold cross-validation is utilized, and experiments are performed on 1800 images. An accuracy of 94.74% was achieved using Quadratic Support Vector Machine. The proposed classification scheme can help patients in the early classification of skin lesions. © 2019 by the authors.

Clinical features of AD vary by age, duration, and severity but can include papules, vesicles, erythema, exudate, xerosis, scaling, and lichenification. However, the most defining and universal symptom of AD is pruritus. Pruritus or itch, defined as an unpleasant urge to scratch, is problematic for many reasons, particularly its negative impact on quality of life. Despite the profoundly negative impact of pruritus on patients with AD, clinicians and researchers lack standardized and validated methods to objectively measure pruritus. The purpose of this review is to discuss emerging methods to assess pruritus in AD by describing objective patient-centered tools developed or enhanced over the last decade that can be utilized by clinicians and researchers alike. Methods: This review is based on a literature search in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The search was performed in February 2019. The keywords were used “pruritus,” “itch,” “atopic dermatitis,” “eczema,” “measurements,” “tools,” “instruments,” “accelerometer,” “wrist actigraphy,” “smartwatch,” “transducer,” “vibration,” “brain mapping,” “magnetic resonance imaging,” and “positron emission tomography.” Only articles written in English were included, and no restrictions were set on study type. To focus on emerging methods, prioritization was given to results from the last decade (2009–2019). Results: The search yielded 49 results in PubMed, 134 results in Embase, and 85 results in Web of Science. Each result was independently reviewed in a standardized manner by two of the authors (M.S., K.L.), and disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus. Relevant findings were categorized into the following sections: video surveillance, acoustic surveillance, wrist actigraphy, smart devices, vibration transducers, and neurological imaging. Examples are provided along with descriptions of how each technology works, instances of use in research or clinical practice, and as applicable, reports of validation studies and correlation with other methods. Conclusion: The variety of new and improved methods to evaluate pruritus in AD is welcomed by clinicians, researchers, and patients alike. Future directions include next-generation smart devices as well as exploring new territories, such as identifying biomarkers that correlate to itch and machine-learning programs to identify itch processing in the brain. As these efforts continue, it will be essential to remain patient-centered by developing techniques that minimize discomfort, respect privacy, and provide accurate data that can be used to better manage itch in AD. © 2019, The Author(s).","Atopic dermatitis; Diagnosis; Eczema; Itch; Pruritus","acoustics; actimetry; atopic dermatitis; brain mapping; clinical feature; clinical practice; disease severity; disease surveillance; eczema; erythema; exudate; human; lichenoid eruption; neuroimaging; papule; positron emission tomography; priority journal; pruritus; Review; skin disease assessment; systematic review; vibration; videorecording; wrist actigraphy; xerosis",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: U01AI119125

In this research work, one such effort is made by proposing a mobile-enabled expert system named 'i-Rash' for the classification of inflammatory skin lesions. i-Rash can classify the skin image into one of the four non-overlapping classes, i.e. healthy, acne, eczema, and psoriasis. The classification model for i-Rash is trained using deep learning model SqueezeNet. The pre-trained SqueezeNet is re-trained on the skin image dataset using transfer learning approach. The i-Rash classification model is trained and tested on 1856 images. The trained model is only of 3MB size and is capable of classifying an unseen image in a fraction of seconds with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97.21%, 94.42% and 98.14% respectively. i-Rash is based on a client-server architecture and can serve in initial classification of skin lesions, hence, can play a very important role in minimising the global burden caused by skin diseases. © 2019 IEEE.","Acne classification; Deep learning; Eczema classification; Psoriasis classification; Skin lesions classification; SqueezeNet","Client server computer systems; Deep learning; Dermatology; Engineering research; Expert systems; Classification models; Classification scheme; Client-server architectures; Human disease; Learning models; Skin lesion; SqueezeNet; Transfer learning; Image classification",,,,,,,,"Hameed, N., Hassan, K.A., Hossain, M.A., A comprehensive survey on image-based computer aided diagnosis systems for skin cancer (2016) 2016 10th International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management & Applications (SKIMA, pp. 205-214; Jackson, C., (2017), https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms/special-issues/inflammatory-skin-conditions-2017.[Accessed:28-May-2019, Inflammatory Skin Conditions 2017, [Online]; Hameed, N., Shabut, A., Hossain, M.A., A Computer-aided diagnosis system for classifying prominent skin lesions using machine learning (2018) 10th Computer Science and Electronic Engineering Conference; (2018) The Rise of MHealth Apps: a Market Snapshot, , https://liquid-state.com/mhealth-apps-market-snapshot/, Liquid State, [Online].

Lower relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was shown to be associated with childhood eczema. Considering that developmental and environmental factors could modify the state of children's gut microbiome, we divided the samples into four age groups: 0-0.5 years, 0.5-1 years, 1-2 years and 2-3 years for farther analyses. Data revealed significant inter-group differences between healthy and eczema samples in all age groups, and decreased microbial diversity was most significantly found in children with eczema of age 2-3 years old. Decreased abundance of Bifidobacterium was a major finding in eczema groups from 0.5-3 years compared to the age matched healthy controls, but not significant in children younger than 6 month old. Of note, Bifidobacterium operational taxonomic units were identified by Random Forest with highly predictive power of 0.83 (AUC = 0.83) in ROC analysis, which also confirmed its role as a key genus that is associated with eczema. To verify the sequencing results, we performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides in the same cohort, and in a new eczema cohort (N = 57) for validation. Significantly, lower Bifidobacterium quantities were found in both eczema groups with an age range of 0.5-3 years. These results suggest variations in early gut microbiome are associated with childhood eczema. © FEMS 2019.","16S rRNA gene sequencing; Bifidobacterium; childhood eczema; diversity; gut microbiome; qPCR","RNA 16S;

Computer-Aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to lessen this burden and to help the patients to conduct the early assessment of the skin lesion. Mostly CAD systems available in the literature only provide skin cancer classification. Classification of the skin lesion is a challenging research area due to similar characteristics of skin lesions. A novel CAD system is presented in this research work for the diagnosis of the most common skin lesions (acne, eczema, psoriasis, benign and malignant melanoma). The proposed approach is based on the pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification phase. Experiments were performed on 1800 images and 83% accuracy is achieved for six-class classification using support vector machine with the quadratic kernel. © 2018 IEEE.","automated classification; Computer-Aided classification (CAD);

In this research work, an intelligent diagnosis scheme is proposed for multi-class skin lesion classification. The proposed scheme is implemented using a hybrid approach i.e. using deep convolution neural network and error-correcting output codes (ECOC) support vector machine (SVM). The proposed scheme is designed, implemented and tested to classify skin lesion image into one of five categories, i.e. healthy, acne, eczema, benign, or malignant melanoma. Experiments were performed on 9,144 images obtained from different sources. AlexNET, a pre-trained CNN model was used to extract the features. For classification, the ECOC SVM classifier was used. Using ECOC SVM, the overall accuracy achieved is 86.21%. 10-fold cross validation technique was used to avoid overfitting. The results indicate that features obtained from the convolutional neural network are capable of enhancing the classification performance of multiple skin lesions. © 2018 IEEE.","Acne classification; Convolutional neural network; Eczema classification; Error-correcting output codes model; Melanoma classification; Skin lesion classification; Skin lesion detection; Support vector machine","Application programs; Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Dermatology; Information management; Neural networks; Oncology; Support vector machines; 10-fold cross-validation; Classification performance; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Error correcting output code; Intelligent diagnosis; Low income countries; Skin lesion; Classification (of information)",,,,,,,,"Hollestein, L.M., Nijsten, T., An insight into the global burden of skin diseases (2014) Journal of Investigative Dermatology, 134 (6), pp. 1499-1501. , June; Jaworek-Korjakowska, J., Kleczek, P., ESkin : Study on the smartphone application for early detection of malignant melanoma (2018) Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2018, , https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/5767360; Salem, C., Azar, D., Tokajian, S., An image processing and genetic algorithm-based approach for the detection of melanoma in patients (2018) Methods of Information in Medicine, 57 (1), pp. 74-80. , https://doi.org/10.3412/ME17-01-0061; Picardi, A., Suicide risk in skin disorders (2013) Clinics in Dermatology, 31, pp. 47-56. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clindermatol.2011.11.006; (2018) British Skin Foundation, , http://www.britishskinfoundation.org.uk/Home.aspx, Retrieved May 20, 2018; Editorial, B., The global challenge for skin health (2015) British Journal of Dermatology, pp. 1469-1472. , https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.13854; (2017) 5 Most Common Skin Disorders, , http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/12/15/5-most-common-skin-disorders.html; Hameed, N., Shabut, A., Hossain, M.A., A computer-aided diagnosis system for classifying prominent skin lesions using machine learning 10th Computer Science and Electronic Engineering Conference, , manuscript accepted; Dietterich, T.G., Bakiri, G., Solving multiclass learning problems via error-correcting output codes (1995) Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, pp. 263-286; Hameed, N., Hassan, K.A., Hossain, M.A., A comprehensive survey on image-based computer aided diagnosis systems for skin cancer (2016) 2016 10th International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management &Applications (SKIMA), pp. 205-214. , https://doi.org/10.1109/SKIMA.2016.7916221, IEEE; Taufiq, M.A., Hameed, N., Anjum, A., Hameed, F., M-skin doctor : A mobile enabled system for early melanoma skin cancer detection using support vector machine (2017) EHealth 360, pp. 468-475. , http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-49655-9_57, In K.

The system successfully detects different types of dermatological skin diseases such as keratosis, furuncle, warts, allergic eczema, acrochordon and acne. It consists of phases like disease image processing, training and neural network detection. In image processing, algorithms including Pre-processing, Digital filters, Transformation and feature extraction are employed followed by detection of LSB and HSV values. Disease corresponding to the respective input images gets detected by recurrent neural network algorithm. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

Therapeutic options for AD remain limited, in part because of a lack of well-characterized animal models. There has been increasing interest in developing experimental approaches to study the pathogenesis of human AD in vivo, in vitro, and in silico to better define pathophysiologic mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers that predict therapeutic response. This review critically appraises a range of models, including genetic mutations relevant to AD, experimental challenge of human skin in vivo, tissue culture models, integration of “omics” data sets, and development of predictive computational models. Although no one individual model recapitulates the complex AD pathophysiology, our review highlights insights gained into key elements of cutaneous biology, molecular pathways, and therapeutic target identification through each approach. Recent developments in computational analysis, including application of machine learning and a systems approach to data integration and predictive modeling, highlight the applicability of these methods to AD subclassification (endotyping), therapy development, and precision medicine. Such predictive modeling will highlight knowledge gaps, further inform refinement of biological models, and support new experimental and systems approaches to AD. © 2018 The Authors","Atopic dermatitis; atopic eczema; endotype; human models; machine learning; mechanistic models; precision medicine; skin equivalents; systems biology; tissue culture models","Article; atopic dermatitis; computer model; gene mutation; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; mathematical model; nonhuman; priority journal; tissue culture; atopic dermatitis; biological model; computer simulation; genetics; immunology; pathology; personalized medicine; skin; biological marker; Biomarkers; Computer Simulation; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Models, Immunological; Precision Medicine; Skin",,"Biomarkers",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

Correspondingly, commercial interest has risen for applications where microbial communities make important contributions. These include food production, probiotics, cosmetics, and enzyme discovery. Other commercial applications include software that takes the user's gut microbiome data as one of its inputs and outputs evidence-based, automated, and personalized diet recommendations for balanced blood sugar levels. These applications pose several bioinformatic and data science challenges that range from requiring strain-level resolution in community profiles to the integration of large datasets for predictive machine learning purposes. In this perspective, we provide our insights on such challenges by touching upon several industrial areas, and briefly discuss advances and future directions of bioinformatics and data science in microbiome research. © 2019 van den Bogert, Boekhorst, Pirovano and May.

These algorithms use features derived from images as input to make a decision. So, choosing proper feature extraction methods combined with suitable machine learning (ML) algorithms is very important to achieve good classification accuracy. During the literature survey, we found that there is a lack of information about machine learning algorithms for skin disease classification. To address this problem, we have collected Chronic Eczema, Lichen planus and Plaque psoriasis images using a digital camera and extracted Red, Green and Blue (RGB) color features and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture features. Different combinations of features with four popular ML algorithms were considered to compare classifier performances. Out of the four algorithms tested, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) showed highest classification accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.","Image processing; Linear Discriminant Analysis; Machine learning; Skin diseases; Support Vector Machine","Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Data mining; Dermatology; Diagnosis; Discriminant analysis; Image processing; Learning systems; Support vector machines; Classification accuracy; Classifier performance; Color and texture features; Feature extraction methods; Gray level co occurrence matrix(GLCM); Linear discriminant analyses (LDA); Linear discriminant analysis; Skin disease; Learning algorithms",,,,,,,,"Yadav, N., Yadav, N., Narang, V.K., Skin diseases detection models using image processing: A survey (2016) International Journal of Computer Applications (0975-8887), 137; Ahonen, T., Hadid, A., Pietikainen, M., Face description with local binary patterns: Application to face recognition (2006) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, (12), pp. 2037-2041; Bhattacharyya, D., Ranjan, R., Das, P., Kim, H., Bandyopadhyay, S.K., Biometric authentication techniques and its future possibilities (2009) Computer and Electrical Engineering, 2009.

We propose that the discrepancies arise in part because allergic sensitisation may not be a single entity (as considered conventionally) but a collection of several different classes of sensitisation. We hypothesise that pairings between immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to individual allergenic molecules (components), rather than IgE responses to ‘informative’ molecules, are associated with increased risk of asthma. Methods and findings: In a cross-sectional analysis among 461 children aged 11 years participating in a population-based birth cohort, we measured serum-specific IgE responses to 112 allergen components using a multiplex array (ImmunoCAP Immuno‑Solid phase Allergy Chip [ISAC]). We characterised sensitivity to 44 active components (specific immunoglobulin E [sIgE] > 0.30 units in at least 5% of children) among the 213 (46.2%) participants sensitised to at least one of these 44 components. We adopted several machine learning methodologies that offer a powerful framework to investigate the highly complex sIgE–asthma relationship. Firstly, we applied network analysis and hierarchical clustering (HC) to explore the connectivity structure of component-specific IgEs and identify clusters of component-specific sensitisation (‘component clusters’). Of the 44 components included in the model, 33 grouped in seven clusters (C.sIgE-1–7), and the remaining 11 formed singleton clusters. Cluster membership mapped closely to the structural homology of proteins and/or their biological source. Components in the pathogenesis-related (PR)-10 proteins cluster (C.sIgE-5) were central to the network and mediated connections between components from grass (C.sIgE-4), trees (C.sIgE-6), and profilin clusters (C.sIgE-7) with those in mite (C.sIgE-1), lipocalins (C.sIgE-3), and peanut clusters (C.sIgE-2). We then used HC to identify four common ‘sensitisation clusters’ among study participants: (1) multiple sensitisation (sIgE to multiple components across all seven component clusters and singleton components), (2) predominantly dust mite sensitisation (IgE responses mainly to components from C.sIgE-1), (3) predominantly grass and tree sensitisation (sIgE to multiple components across C.sIgE-4–7), and (4) lower-grade sensitisation. We used a bipartite network to explore the relationship between component clusters, sensitisation clusters, and asthma, and the joint density-based nonparametric differential interaction network analysis and classification (JDINAC) to test whether pairwise interactions of component-specific IgEs are associated with asthma. JDINAC with pairwise interactions provided a good balance between sensitivity (0.84) and specificity (0.87), and outperformed penalised logistic regression with individual sIgE components in predicting asthma, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94, compared with 0.73. We then inferred the differential network of pairwise component-specific IgE interactions, which demonstrated that 18 pairs of components predicted asthma. These findings were confirmed in an independent sample of children aged 8 years who participated in the same birth cohort but did not have component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) data at age 11 years. The main limitation of our study was the exclusion of potentially important allergens caused by both the ISAC chip resolution as well as the filtering step. Clustering and the network analyses might have provided different solutions if additional components had been available. Conclusions: Interactions between pairs of sIgE components are associated with increased risk of asthma and may provide the basis for designing diagnostic tools for asthma. © 2018 Fontanella et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",,"allergen; house dust allergen; immunoglobulin 7S; immunoglobulin E antibody; lipocalin; napin; profilin; allergen; biological marker; immunoglobulin E; algorithm; allergic reaction; antibody response; antigen antibody reaction; area under the curve; Article; asthma; child; clinical outcome; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; comparative study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; demography; Dermatophagoides; differential diagnosis; disease classification; eczema; follow up; grass; human; machine learning; major clinical study; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; mite; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; pairwise interaction; pathogenesis; peanut allergy; protein expression; protein interaction; protein microarray; questionnaire; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; school child; sensitivity and specificity; sensitization; tree; validation process; wheezing; asthma; blood; data mining; England; female; hypersensitivity; immunology; male; procedures; risk assessment; Allergens; Asthma; Biomarkers; Child; Cluster Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Mining; England; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunoglobulin E; Machine Learning; Male; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors",,"napin, 89147-51-3; profilin, 131383-86-3; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Allergens; Biomarkers; Immunoglobulin E","ImmunoCAP ISAC, Thermo, Sweden","Thermo, Sweden","Medical Research Council, MRC: MR/K002449/1, MR/L012693/1","The authors AC and AS received from the Medical Research Council (https://mrc.ukri.org/) with grants MR/L012693/1 and MR/K002449/1.",,"Custovic, A., Lazic, N., Simpson, A., Pediatric asthma and development of atopy (2013) Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology, 13 (2), pp. 173-180. , pmid:23385287; Oksel, C., Custovic, A., Development of allergic sensitization and its relevance to paediatric asthma (2018) Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 18 (2), pp. 109-116. , pmid:29389732; Pearce, N., Pekkanen, J., Beasley, R., How much asthma is really attributable to atopy?

Here we introduce a powerful new method, ASMC, that can estimate coalescence times using only SNP array data, and is orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches. We applied ASMC to detect recent positive selection in 113,851 phased British samples from the UK Biobank, and detected 12 genome-wide significant signals, including 6 novel loci. We also applied ASMC to sequencing data from 498 Dutch individuals to detect background selection at deeper time scales. We detected strong heritability enrichment in regions of high background selection in an analysis of 20 independent diseases and complex traits using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression, conditioned on a broad set of functional annotations (including other background selection annotations). These results underscore the widespread effects of background selection on the genetic architecture of complex traits. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"HLA antigen; low density lipoprotein; mucin; STAT4 protein; toll like receptor; age; algorithm; anorexia; anxa3 gene; Article; ascertained sequentially markovian coalescent; autism; background selection; biobank; body height; body mass; coalescence time; coronary artery disease; Crohn disease; diastolic blood pressure; diseases; Dutchman; eczema; education; fam19a5 gene; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; gene; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; gene structure; genetic trait; genome-wide association study; grm5 gene; heritability; high throughput sequencing; human; human genome; igh gene; immune response; immunity; intermethod comparison; lct gene; lupus vulgaris; machine learning; mc1r gene; measurement accuracy; menarche; menopause; meta analysis (topic); myl4 gene; natural selection; neurosis; nutrition; pigmentation; pkd1l3 gene; positive selection; priority journal; putamen; rheumatoid arthritis; schizophrenia; signal processing; simulation; single nucleotide polymorphism; smoking; taste; time; United Kingdom; whole genome sequencing; biological model; diseases; genetics; high throughput screening; molecular genetics; multifactorial inheritance; procedures; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Multifactorial Inheritance; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci",,"toll like receptor, 409141-78-2",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

The aim of this study was to reassess histopathology and immunophenotyping properties to distinguish between ACD, ICD, and AD. Charts of patients with eczema, who had undergone complete routine diagnostic workup (skin biopsies, patch tests, skin prick tests, and respectively or serum IgE levels), were reviewed. Thirty-five skin biopsy specimens of 28 patients (mean age 64 6 15 years; = 13 = 15) with clear diagnosis of ACD (n = 15), ICD (n = 6), or AD (n = 14) were analyzed. Histomorphological and immunohistochemical (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11c, CD34, CD123, S100, and IL-17) parameters were evaluated using Kruskal–Wallis test, Wilcoxon test, Fisher exact test, and decision tree analysis. Eosinophils were statistically significant (P = 0.0184), more often observed in AD than in ACD or ICD. No other statistically significant differences were found with regard to epidermal patterns, patterns of dermal infiltrates, or immunophenotyping. Using predictive modeling approaches, dermal eosinophils were found to be associated with AD, necrotic epidermal keratinocytes with ICD, and a focal type of parakeratosis with ACD. As an additional finding, pseudo-Pautrier microabscesses, which were present in the skin of 2 AD and 2 ACD patients, contained myeloid dendritic cells (CD11c+). Differentiation of ACD, ICD, and AD should be based on clinical features and results of allergy tests. Histopathology does not reliably differentiate between ACD, ICD, and AD, but helps to exclude psoriasis, tinea, or T-cell lymphoma. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Our objective is to develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to identify patients that meet API criteria. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study nested in a birth cohort study in Olmsted County, MN. Asthma status ascertained by manual chart review based on API criteria served as gold standard. NLP-API was developed on a training cohort (n=87) and validated on a test cohort (n=427). Criterion validity was measured by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the NLP algorithm against manual chart review for asthma status. Construct validity was determined by associations of asthma status defined by NLP-API with known risk factors for asthma. Results: Among the eligible 427 subjects of the test cohort, 48% were males and 74% were White. Median age was 5.3years (interquartile range 3.6-6.8). 35 (8%) had a history of asthma by NLP-API vs. 36 (8%) by abstractor with 31 by both approaches. NLP-API predicted asthma status with sensitivity 86%, specificity 98%, positive predictive value 88%, negative predictive value 98%. Asthma status by both NLP and manual chart review were significantly associated with the known asthma risk factors, such as history of allergic rhinitis, eczema, family history of asthma, and maternal history of smoking during pregnancy (p value <0.05). Maternal smoking [odds ratio: 4.4, 95% confidence interval 1.8-10.7] was associated with asthma status determined by NLP-API and abstractor, and the effect sizes were similar between the reviews with 4.4 vs 4.2 respectively. Conclusion: NLP-API was able to ascertain asthma status in children mining from EHR and has a potential to enhance asthma care and research through population management and large-scale studies when identifying children who meet API criteria. © 2018 The Author(s).","API; Asthma; Epidemiology; Informatics; NLP","algorithm; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; automation; Caucasian; construct validity; cross-sectional study; eczema; ethnicity; family history; female; gestational age; gold standard; human; major clinical study; male; maternal smoking; natural language processing algorithm; passive smoking; predictive value; risk assessment; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; algorithm; child; data mining; electronic health record; natural language processing; preschool child; procedures; reproducibility; Algorithms; Asthma; Automation; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Mining; Electronic Health Records; Female; Humans; Male; Natural Language Processing; Reproducibility of Results",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

Psoriasis and eczema are two conditions that are usually misdiagnosed, and were selected after an investigation. The reason for this high rate of misdiagnosis is due to the margin of error present in the method doctors use to perform a diagnosis. This method consists of using the visual aspects of the disease along with non-visual patient history questions. This method is not as effective when certain diseases do not have definitive answers to these history questions and the doctors have to base the diagnosis almost entirely on the visual aspects displayed on this skin. The proposed solution addresses this problem by combining both the visual as well as nonvisual feature vectors into a single classifier, a support vector machine, which once trained, enables diagnosing to a reliable level of accuracy at 84%. © 2017 IEEE.","image processing; machine leaning; statistical processing","Data handling; Dermatology; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Categorical data; Dermatological disease; Differential diagnosis; Feature vectors; Machine leaning; Margin of error; Patient history; Statistical processing; Image processing",,,,,,,,"Amarathunga, A.A.L.C., Ellawala, E.P.W.C., Abeysekara, G.N., Amalraj, C.R.J., (2015) Expert System for Diagnosis of Skin Diseases; Arifin, M.S., Kibria, M.G., Firoze, A., Amin, M.A., Yan, H., (2013) Dermatological Disease Diagnosis Using Color Skin Images; (2013) The Psychological and Social Impact of Skin Diseases on People's Lives; (2006) Should the Binary, Categorical Variables Be Standardized?, , http://compgroups.net/comp.soft-sys.sas/should-thebinary-categorical-variables-be/678227, Nov. 21, [Feb. 22 2017]; Okuboyejo, D.A., Olugbara, O.O., Odunaike, S.A., (2013) Automating Skin Disease Diagnosis Using Image Classification; Support Vector Machines (SVM), , http://www.statsoft.com/Textbook/Support-Vector-Machines, [Feb. 22 2017]; Warrell, D.A., Cox, T.M., (2010) Oxford Textbook of Medicine (5th Edition); Wolff, K., Johnson, R., Saavedra, A., (2013) Fitzpatrick's Color Atlas and Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology (7th Edition); Yasir, R., Rahman, A., Ahmed, N., (2015) A Skin Disease Detection System for Financially Unstable People in Developing Countries",,,"Cambio - Software Engineering;IFS;Millennium Information Technologies (MIT);National Science Foundation","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","17th International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions, ICTer 2017","7 September 2017 through 8 September 2017",,134274,,9781538624432,,,"English","Int.

Despite recent advances in immunophenotypic and genetic discovery, clinical care of CVID remains limited by our inability to accurately model risk for non-infectious disease development. Herein, we demonstrate the utility of unbiased network clustering as a novel method to analyze inter-relationships between non-infectious disease outcomes in CVID using databases at the United States Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET), the centralized immunodeficiency registry of the United States, and Partners, a tertiary care network in Boston, MA, USA, with a shared electronic medical record amenable to natural language processing. Immunophenotypes were comparable in terms of native antibody deficiencies, low titer response to pneumococcus, and B cell maturation arrest. However, recorded non-infectious disease outcomes were more substantial in the Partners cohort across the spectrum of lymphoproliferation, cytopenias, autoimmunity, atopy, and malignancy. Using unbiased network clustering to analyze 34 non-infectious disease outcomes in the Partners cohort, we further identified unique patterns of lymphoproliferative (two clusters), autoimmune (two clusters), and atopic (one cluster) disease that were defined as CVID non-infectious endotypes according to discrete and non-overlapping immunophenotypes. Markers were both previously described [high serum IgE in the atopic cluster [odds ratio (OR) 6.5] and low class-switched memory B cells in the total lymphoproliferative cluster (OR 9.2)] and novel [low serum C3 in the total lymphoproliferative cluster (OR 5.1)]. Mortality risk in the Partners cohort was significantly associated with individual non-infectious disease outcomes as well as lymphoproliferative cluster 2, specifically (OR 5.9). In contrast, unbiased network clustering failed to associate known comorbidities in the adult USIDNET cohort. Together, these data suggest that unbiased network clustering can be used in CVID to redefine non-infectious disease inter-relationships; however, applicability may be limited to datasets well annotated through mechanisms such as natural language processing. The lymphoproliferative, autoimmune, and atopic Partners CVID endotypes herein described can be used moving forward to streamline genetic and biomarker discovery and to facilitate early screening and intervention in CVID patients at highest risk for autoimmune and inflammatory progression. © 2018 Farmer, Ong, Barmettler, Yonker, Fuleihan, Sullivan, Cunningham-Rundles, The USIDNET Consortium and Walter.","Atopy; Autoimmunity; Common variable immunodeficiency; Endotypes; Lymphoproliferation; Non-infectious complications; Unbiased network clustering","CD16 antigen; CD19 antigen; CD27 antigen; CD3 antigen; CD4 antigen; CD56 antigen; CD8 antigen; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; adult; aged; allergic rhinitis; alopecia; anemia; Article; asthma; autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome; B lymphocyte; cell infiltration; cell maturation; common variable immunodeficiency; computer assisted tomography; computer model; Crohn disease; eczema; follow up; human; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; immunophenotyping; inflammatory bowel disease; information processing; leukemia; lymphocyte proliferation; lymphocytopenia; lymphoma; major clinical study; medical record review; multiple myeloma; myelodysplastic syndrome; natural language processing; neutropenia; psoriasis; pulmonary hypertension; rheumatoid arthritis; Streptococcus pneumoniae; unbiased network clustering; urticaria; vitiligo",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; immunoglobulin M, 9007-85-6",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: T32-HL116275

Methods: A systematic search of the following online databases was performed: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, EconLit, Scopus, Health Technology Assessment, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and Web of Science. Papers were eligible for inclusion if they described a decision–analytic model evaluating both the costs and benefits associated with an intervention or prevention for atopic eczema. Data were extracted using a standardised form by two independent reviewers, whilst quality was assessed using the model-specific Philips criteria. Results: Twenty-four models were identified, evaluating either preventions (n = 12) or interventions (n = 12): 14 reported using a Markov modelling approach, four utilised decision trees and one a discrete event simulation, whilst five did not specify the approach. The majority, 22 studies, reported that the intervention was dominant or cost effective, given the assumptions and analytical perspective taken. Notably, the models tended to be short-term (16 used a time horizon of ≤1 year), often providing little justification for the limited time horizon chosen. The methodological and reporting quality of the studies was generally weak, with only seven studies fulfilling more than 50% of their applicable Philips criteria. Conclusions: This is the first systematic review of decision models in eczema. Whilst the majority of models reported favourable outcomes in terms of the cost effectiveness of the new intervention, the usefulness of these findings for decision-making is questionable. In particular, there is considerable scope for increasing the range of interventions evaluated, for improving modelling structures and reporting quality. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"atopic dermatitis; Cinahl; Cochrane Library; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; decision tree; economic evaluation; Embase; human; Markov chain; Medline; practice guideline; priority journal; quality control; Review; Scopus; systematic review; Web of Science; atopic dermatitis; cost benefit analysis; decision support system; economic model; economics; time factor; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Support Techniques; Decision Trees; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Markov Chains; Models, Economic; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Time Factors",,,,,"National Institute for Health Research, NIHR","Funding This work was funded as part of Professor Tracey Sach’s Career Development Fellowship (CDF award-2014-07-006) supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).

Itch, like pain, is a subjective symptom. Characterizing itchy skin and skin prone to itch will lead to better understanding of these symptoms and ultimately better diagnosis and treatment of the underlining disease. The goal of our study is to determine whether the itchy skin region can be detected by hyperspectral imaging. We used an imaging system equipped with liquid crystal tunable filter for collecting hyperspectral images. A halogen lamp was used to illuminate the region of interest. Images were taken from 650 nm to 1100 nm wavelength with 10 nm interval. The hyperspectral images were collected from the forearms of two male and two female subjects. An approximate 50 mm × 50 mm region of interest was marked on the forearms before imaging. The itch was mechanically induced. Imaging was performed for three conditions with a 99% Spectralon white diffuse reflectance target on the side: before inducing itch (normal region), after inducing itch (test region), and after removing itch (control region). Two methods were used to detect the itchy and nonitchy regions from the normalized hyperspectral data. The first method used a spectral distribution exploration method. The second method used a supervised classification method, more specifically, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The spectral distribution exploration method did not detect any different spectral signature for itchy region. On the other hand, the SVM classifier detected the itchy region with the surrounding non-itchy region. These results demonstrated the feasibility of using hyperspectral imaging combined with classification algorithms for detecting itchy skin region. © 2018 SPIE.","Dermatology; Hyperspectral Imaging; Inflammatory Skin; Itchy Skin; Supervised Classification; Support Vector Machine","Dermatology; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Liquid crystals; Spectroscopy; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Chronic renal failure; Classification algorithm; Exploration methods; Liquid crystal tunable filter; Spectral distribution; Subjective symptoms; Supervised classification; Support vector machine algorithm; Hyperspectral imaging",,,,,,,,"Yosipovitch, G., Greaves, M.W., Schmelz, M., (2003) Itch the Lancet, 361 (9358), pp. 690-694; Garibyan, L., Rheingold, C.G., Lerner, E.A., Understanding the Pathophysiology of Itch (2013) Dermatologic Therapy, 26 (2), pp. 84-91; Kini, S., DeLong, L., Veledar, E., McKenzie-Brown, A., Schaufele, M., Chen, S., The impact of pruritus on quality of life: The skin equivalent of pain (2011) Archives of Dermatology, 147 (10), pp. 1153-1156; Hamblin, M., Avci, P., Gupta, G., (2016) Imaging in Dermatology, , Elsevier Science; Hsieh, C., Hagermark, O., Stahle-Backdahl, M., Ericson, K., Eriksson, L., Stone-Elander, S., Ingvar, M., Urge to scratch represented in the human cerebral cortex during itch (1994) Journal of Neurophysiology, 72 (6), pp. 3004-3008; Yosipovitch, G., Mochizuki, H., (2015) Neuroimaging of Itch As A Tool of Assessment of Chronic Itch and Its Management, , Springer Berlin Heidelberg Berlin, Heidelberg; Akbari, H., Kosugi, Y., Kojima, K., Tanaka, N., Detection and analysis of the intestinal ischemia using visible and invisible hyperspectral imaging (2010) IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 57 (8), pp. 2011-2017; Joseph, A., (2012) Hyperspectral Optical Imaging for Detection, Diagnosis, and Staging of Cancer, , PhD Thesis University of Southern California; Lu, G., Fei, B., Medical hyperspectral imaging: A review (2014) Journal of Biomedical Optics, 19 (1), pp. 1-24; Qu, Y., Ren, W., Liu, S., Liu, P., Xie, L., Zhang, X., Zhang, S., Xu, R., Polarized hyperspectral imaging system for in vivo detection of vulvar lichen sclerosis (2016) Proc.

The basic idea is to assemble multiple residual neural networks (ResNets), in which the training data has been pretreated with different methods. For different situations with practical applications, we put forward two training methods. Our method performs better than a single ResNet or a simple ensemble of ResNets. The validity of the framework is verified on two data sets: dermoscopic images and skin surface photos. For dermoscopic images, we completed the third part of a public competition, called “ISIC 2017: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection”. The metric is the mean value of the area under the curve (AUC) for the melanoma and seborrheic keratosis classifications. Our framework achieves a result of 0.917 on the test set, which is 0.046 higher than a single ResNet. For skin surface photos, we collected images of four diseases, including eczema, heatrash, subitum, and varicella. The framework achieves 82.4% accuracy on the test set, which is 3% higher than the baseline. This implies that the proposed framework is applicable in practice and achieves excellent performance. © 2018","Deep convolutional neural network; Medical image classification; Model ensemble; Multi-Channel-ResNet; Skin diseases",,,,,,,"We would like to thank the International Skin Imaging Collaboration for their effort in collecting the data used in our paper.

The illness caused by bacteria or infections will be known as skin disease like yeast infection, allergy, eczema, brown spot. These skin diseases have dangerous effect on skin and they keep on spreading over time. To control them from spreading it is necessary to identify these diseases at their starting stages. We adopted many technologies to identify these diseases like image processing, artificial neural network, data mining etc. Now a day's image processing is most effective for detection of these kinds of skin diseases. It uses different techniques to identify the part affected by disease like feature extraction, filtering, image pre-processing, image segmentation etc. It also identifies the affected areas color as well as the form of affected area. The paper conducts the review of various image processing techniques which are used for diagnosis of skin diseases in recent time. Analysis of the different methodologies and their performances that are utilized in these techniques of skin diseases diagnosis also be done. © 2017 IEEE.","Filtering; Image pre-processing; Image processing; Segmentation; Skin diseases","Data mining; Dermatology; Disease control; Filtration; Image processing; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Affected area; Brown spots; Image preprocessing; Image processing technique; Skin disease; Skin lesion; Diagnosis",,,,,,,,"Jain, S., Pise, N., Computer aided melanoma skin cancer detection using image processing (2015) Procedia-Procedia Comput.

Due to the similar appearance of skin diseases, automatic classification through lesion images is quite a challenging task. In this paper, a novel multi-classification method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for dermoscopy images. A CNN network with nested residual structure is designed first, which can learn more information than the original residual structure. Then, the designed network are trained through transfer learning. With the trained network, 6 kinds of lesion diseases are classified, including nevus, seborrheic keratosis, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, eczema and basal cell carcinoma. The experiments are conducted on six-classification and two-classification tasks, and with the accuracies of 65.8% and 90% respectively, our method greatly outperforms other 4 state-of-The-Art networks and the average of 149 professional dermatologists. © 2017 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; dermoscopy image; lesion classification","Convolution; Deep learning; Dermatitis; Dermatology; Diagnosis; Imaging systems; Neural networks; Automatic classification; Basal cell carcinoma; Classification tasks; Convolutional neural network; Dermoscopy images; Lesion classification; Multi-classification; Residual structure; Image classification",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61371134, 61471016","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 61471016 and 61371134).",,"Cascinelli, N., Ferrario, M., Tonelli, T., A possible new tool for clinical diagnosis of melanoma: The computer (1987) Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 16 (2), pp. 361-367; Sober, A.J., Burstein, J.M., Computerized digital image analysis: An aid for melanoma diagnosis-preliminary investigations and brief review (1994) Journal of Dermatology, 21 (11), pp. 885-890; Ganster, H., Pinz, A., Rohrer, R., Automated melanoma recognition (2001) IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 20 (3), pp. 233-239; Celebi, M.E., Kingravi, H.A., Uddin, B., A methodological approach to the classification of dermoscopy images (2007) Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, 31 (6), pp. 362-373; Xie, F.Y., Fan, H., Yang, L., Melanoma classification on dermoscopy images using a neural Network Ensemble Model (2016) IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, (99), p. 1; Esteva, A., Kuprel, B., Novoa, R.A., Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks (2017) Nature, 542 (7639), p. 115; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (2016) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 770-778; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., (2014) Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-scale Image Recognition, , arXiv preprint arXiv 1409.1556; Szegedy, C., Liu, W., Jia, Y., Going deeper with convolutions (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1-9; Xie, S., Girshick, R., Dollr, P., Aggregated residual transformations for deep neural networks Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016; Lecun, Y., Boser, B., Denker, J.S., Backpropagation applied to handwritten zip code recognition (2014) Neural Computation, 1 (4), pp. 541-551; Lecun, Y., Bengio, Y., Hinton, G., Deep learning (2015) Nature, 521 (7553), pp. 436-444; Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge (2015) International Journal of Computer Vision, 115 (3), pp. 211-252; Bengio, Y., Simard, P., Frasconi, P., (1994) Learning Long-Term Dependencies with Gradient Descent Is Difficult, p. 157. , IEEE Press; Rumelhart, D.E., Hinton, G.E., Williams, R.J., Learning Internal Representation by Error Propagation (1988) Neurocomputing: Foundations of Research, 1, pp. 318-362. , MIT Press; Jia, Y., Shelhamer, E., Donahue, J., Caffe: Convolutional architecture for fast feature embedding (2014) Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 675-678. , ACM",,,"IEEE;IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques, IST 2017","18 October 2017 through 20 October 2017",,134295,,9781538616208,,,"English","IST - IEEE Int.

Using a matched case control design with 3911 ASD cases and 38,609 controls, we found that 38 out of 79 medical conditions were associated with increased ASD risk. Developmental delay, mental health, and neurology conditions had the strongest associations (ORs 2.0–23.3). Moderately strong associations were observed for nutrition, genetic, ear nose and throat, and sleep conditions (ORs 2.1–3.2). Using machine learning methods, we clustered children based on their medical conditions prior to ASD diagnosis and demonstrated ASD risk stratification. Our findings provide new evidence indicating that children with ASD have a disproportionate burden of certain medical conditions preceding ASD diagnosis. © 2017, The Author(s).","Autism spectrum disorder; Comorbidity; Medical conditions","accidental injury; adjustment disorder; allergic rhinitis; anemia; anxiety disorder; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; attention deficit disorder; autism; autoimmune disease; bacterial infection; cardiovascular disease; case control study; central nervous system disease; cerebral palsy; child; childhood disease; childhood injury; childhood obesity; cognitive defect; conjunctivitis; constipation; contact dermatitis; controlled study; degenerative disease; depression; developmental delay; diarrhea; disease association; disorders of acid base balance; drug hypersensitivity; ear infection; ear nose throat disease; eczema; electrolyte disturbance; endocrine disease; epilepsy; esophagus disease; eye infection; face malformation; female; female genital tract infection; food allergy; fracture; functional disease; gastroesophageal reflux; gastrointestinal infection; gastrointestinal motility disorder; genetic disorder; head and neck injury; headache; hematologic malignancy; human; hyperalimentation; impulse control disorder; inflammatory bowel disease; intoxication; kidney disease; language delay; learning disorder; lower respiratory tract infection; lung disease; major clinical study; male; motor dysfunction; musculoskeletal disease; mycosis; nervous system malformation; neurologic disease; nutritional disorder; peripheral neuropathy; preschool child; priority journal; school child; skin infection; skull malformation; sleep disorder; sleep disordered breathing; Stevens Johnson syndrome; tic; upper respiratory tract infection; urogenital tract infection; urticaria; virus infection; autism; child health; developmental disorder; mental health; risk; statistics and numerical data; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Developmental Disabilities; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Risk",,,,,,,,"Agresti, A., Kateri, M., (2011) Categorical data analysis, , Springer, Berlin Heidelberg; (2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5), , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Atladottir, H.O., Thorsen, P., Schendel, D.E., Ostergaard, L., Lemcke, S., Parner, E.T., Association of hospitalization for infection in childhood with diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders: A Danish cohort study (2010) Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, 164 (5), pp. 470-477; Bauman, M.L., Medical comorbidities in autism: challenges to diagnosis and treatment (2010) Neurotherapeutics: The Journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, 7 (3), pp. 320-327; Black, C., Kaye, J.A., Jick, H., Relation of childhood gastrointestinal disorders to autism: Nested case-control study using data from the UK general practice research database (2002) Bmj, 325 (7361), pp. 419-421. , PID: 12193358; Blumberg, S.J., Bramlett, M.D., Kogan, M.D., Schieve, L.A., Jones, J.R., Lu, M.C., Changes in prevalence of parent-reported autism spectrum disorder in school-aged U.S. children: 2007 to 2011–2012 (2013) National Health Statistics Reports, 65, pp. 1-11; Brennan, L., Barton, M., Chen, C.M., Green, J., Fein, D., Detecting subgroups in children diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (2015) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 45 (5), pp. 1329-1344. , PID: 25374133; Buie, T., Campbell, D.B., Fuchs, G.J., 3rd, Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders in individuals with ASDs: A consensus report (2010) Pediatrics, 125, pp. S1-S18. , PID: 20048083; Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders—autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network, United States, 2006.

These adjacent regions show one of the most contrasting socio-economical differences in the world. Objective: We explored changes in allergy from school age to young adulthood from 2003 to 2010/2012 in these two areas. The skin and nasal microbiota were also compared. Methods: Randomly selected children from Finnish (n = 98) and Russian Karelia (n = 82) were examined in 2003, when the children were 7–11 years of age, and again in 2010 (Finnish Karelia) and 2012 (Russian Karelia). We analysed self-reported allergy symptoms and sensitization to common allergens by serum sIgE values. The skin (volar forearm) and nasal mucosa microbiota, collected in 2012 (aged 15–20 years), identified from DNA samples, were compared with multivariate methods. Results: Asthma, hay fever, atopic eczema, self-reported rhinitis, as well as atopic sensitization, were threefold to 10-fold more common in Finland, as compared to Russian Karelia. Hay fever and peanut sensitization were almost non-existent in Russia. These patterns remained throughout the 10-year follow-up. Skin microbiota, as well as bacterial and fungal communities in nasal mucosa, was contrastingly different between the populations, best characterized by the diversity and abundance of genus Acinetobacter; more abundant and diverse in Russia. Overall, diversity was significantly higher among Russian subjects (Pskin &lt; 0.0001, Pnasal-bacteria &lt; 0.0001 and Pnasal-fungi &lt; 0.01). Allergic diseases were not associated with microbial diversity in Finnish subjects. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Differences in allergic phenotype, developed in early life, remain between populations. A parallel difference in the composition of skin and nasal microbiota suggests a potential underlying mechanism. Our results also suggest that high abundance and diversity of Acinetobacter might contribute to the low allergy prevalence in Russia. Implications of early-life exposure to Acinetobacter should be further investigated. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","allergy; Finland; microbiota; Russia; specific IgE","DNA; egg white; food allergen; immunoglobulin E; Acinetobacter; Acinetobacter johnsonii; Acinetobacter lwoffii; adolescent; adult; Aerococcus; Artemisia vulgaris; Article; Aspergillus; asthma; atopic dermatitis; bacterium; birch; cat; child; Cladosporium herbarum; controlled study; Corynebacterium; Dermatophagoides; dog; female; Finland; fish; follow up; forearm; fungal community; fungal flora; health disparity; horse; human; Jeotgalicoccus; major clinical study; male; microbial community; microbial diversity; Micrococcus; Micrococcus flavus; Micrococcus luteus; milk; nose epithelium; nose mucosa; peanut; Phleum pratense; Phoma; pollen allergy; prevalence; priority journal; random forest; Republic of Karelia; rhinitis; school child; sensitization; skin flora; soybean; wheat; Acinetobacter; clinical trial; hypersensitivity; microbiology; microflora; multicenter study; nose cavity; randomized controlled trial; Russian Federation; skin; Acinetobacter; Child; Female; Finland; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Male; Microbiota; Nasal Cavity; Prevalence; Russia; Skin",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; egg white, 9006-50-2; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,"Academy of Finland

Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy (MeDALL; EU FP7-CP-IP; project no: 261357; 2010-2015) studied the complex links of allergic diseases at the clinical and mechanistic levels by linking epidemiologic, clinical, and mechanistic research, including in vivo and in vitro models. MeDALL integrated 14 European birth cohorts, including 44,010 participants and 160 cohort follow-ups between pregnancy and age 20 years. Thirteen thousand children were prospectively followed after puberty by using a newly standardized MeDALL Core Questionnaire. A microarray developed for allergen molecules with increased IgE sensitivity was obtained for 3,292 children. Estimates of air pollution exposure from previous studies were available for 10,000 children. Omics data included those from historical genome-wide association studies (23,000 children) and DNA methylation (2,173), targeted multiplex biomarker (1,427), and transcriptomic (723) studies. Using classical epidemiology and machine-learning methods in 16,147 children aged 4 years and 11,080 children aged 8 years, MeDALL showed the multimorbidity of eczema, rhinitis, and asthma and estimated that only 38% of multimorbidity was attributable to IgE sensitization. MeDALL has proposed a new vision of multimorbidity independent of IgE sensitization, and has shown that monosensitization and polysensitization represent 2 distinct phenotypes. The translational component of MeDALL is shown by the identification of a novel allergic phenotype characterized by polysensitization and multimorbidity, which is associated with the frequency, persistence, and severity of allergic symptoms. The results of MeDALL will help integrate personalized, predictive, preventative, and participatory approaches in allergic diseases. © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","allergy; Asthma; atopic dermatitis; rhinitis","allergen; biological marker; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E; air pollution; allergic disease; asthma; data base; DNA methylation; eczema; follow up; genome-wide association study; human; machine learning; medicine; microarray analysis; morbidity; outcome assessment; phenotype; pregnancy; priority journal; puberty; questionnaire; Review; rhinitis; sensitization; transcriptomics; adolescent; animal; child; clinical trial; cohort analysis; comorbidity; Europe; female; gene expression profiling; genetics; hypersensitivity; immunization; immunology; metabolism; multicenter study; phenotype; translational research; young adult; Adolescent; Allergens; Animals; Child; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Europe; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunization; Immunoglobulin E; Phenotype; Translational Medical Research; Young Adult",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Allergens; Immunoglobulin E",,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x00F6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF: 159870",,,"Bousquet, J., Anto, J., Auffray, C., Akdis, M., Cambon-Thomsen, A., Keil, T., MeDALL (Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy): an integrated approach from phenotypes to systems medicine (2011) Allergy, 66, pp. 596-604; Martinez, F.D., Genes, environments, development and asthma: a reappraisal (2007) Eur Respir J, 29, pp. 179-184; Bousquet, J., Anto, J.M., Wickman, M., Keil, T., Valenta, R., Haahtela, T., Are allergic multimorbidities and IgE polysensitization associated with the persistence or re-occurrence of foetal type 2 signalling?

Early detection and continuous observation of eczemas allows for efficient treatment and can therefore relieve symptoms. However, purely manual skin control is tedious and often error prone. Thus, an automatic approach that can assist the dermatologist with his work is desirable. Together with our industry partner swiss4ward, we devised an image processing method for hand eczema segmentation based on support vector machines and conducted several experiments with different feature sets. Our implementation is planned to be integrated into a clinical information system for operational use at the University Hospital Zurich. Instead of focusing on a high accuracy like most existing state-of-the-art approaches, we selected F1 score as our primary measure. This decision had several implications regarding the design of our segmentation method, since all popular implementations of support vector machines aim for optimizing accuracy. Finally, we evaluated our system and achieved an F1 score of 58.6% for front sides of hands and 43.8% for back sides, which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods that were tested on our gold standard data set as well. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Classification; Eczema Detection and Quantification; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machines","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Image segmentation; Information use; Learning systems; Medical information systems; Vectors; Automatic approaches; Clinical information system; Continuous observation; Detection and quantifications; Image processing - methods; Segmentation methods; State-of-the-art approach; State-of-the-art methods; Support vector machines",,,,,,"We would like to thank CTI2 for funding this research and swiss4ward3 and the University Hospital of Zurich 4 for the productive collaboration.",,"Abdul-Rahman, S., Norhan, A.K., Yusoff, M., Mohamed, A., Mutalib, S., Dermatology diagnosis with feature selection methods and artificial neural network (2012) Proceedings of the IEEE EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences (IECBES), pp. 371-376. , IEEE; Amarathunga, A., Ellawala, E., Abeysekara, G., Amalraj, C., Expert system for diagnosis of skin diseases (2015) International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 4 (1); Batista, G.E.A.P.A., Prati, R.C., Monard, M.C., A study of the behavior of several methods for balancing machine learning training data (2004) ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 6 (1), pp. 20-29; Batuwita, R., Palade, V., Class imbalance learning methods for support vector machines (2013) Imbalanced Learning, pp. 83-99. , In He, H. and Ma, Y., editors, John Wiley & Sons, Inc, Hoboken, New Jersey; Ben-Hur, A., Weston, J., A user's guide to support vector machines (2010) Methods in Molecular Biology (Clifton, N.J.), 609, pp. 223-239; Chang, C.-C., Lin, C.-J., LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines (2011) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2, pp. 271-2727. , http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/cjlin/libsvm; Chawla, N.V., Bowyer, K.W., Hall, L.O., Kegelmeyer, W.P., Smote: Synthetic minority oversampling technique (2002) Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 16 (1), pp. 321-357; Cula, O.G., Dana, K.J., Murphy, F.P., Rao, B.K., Bidirectional imaging and modeling of skin texture (2004) IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 51 (12), pp. 2148-2159; Diepgen, T.L., Occupational skin-disease data in Europe (2003) International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, 76 (5), pp. 331-338; English, J., Current concepts of irritant contact dermatitis (2016) Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 61, p. 722726; Gebejes, A., Huertas, R., Texture characterization based on grey-level co-occurrence matrix (2013) Proceedings of the Conference of Informatics and Management Sciences, 2, pp. 375-378. , EDIS -Publishing Institution of the University of Zilina; Hald, M., Berg, N., Elberling, J., Johansen, J., Medical consultations in relation to severity of hand eczema in the general population (2008) The British Journal of Dermatology, 158, pp. 773-777; Haralick, R.M., Shanmugam, K., Dinstein, I., Textural features for image classification (1973) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, SMC, 3 (6), pp. 610-621; Joachims, T., A support vector method for multivariate performance measures (2005) Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), , Bonn, Germany; Johansen, J., Classification of hand eczema: Clinical and aetiological types (2011) Based on the Guideline of the Danish Contact Dermatitis Group.

These systems extract the features from pre-processed images and use them for identifying the skin lesions through machine learning as the core. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a system that implements a multi-model, multi-level system using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture for eczema detection. In this work, multi-model system is defined as architecture with different models depending on the input characteristic. The outputs of these models are integrated by a decision layer, thus multi-level, which computes the probability of an eczema case. The resulting system has 68.37% average confidence level as opposed to the 63.01% of the single level, i.e. Single model, system in the actual testing of eczema versus non-eczema cases. Furthermore, the multi-model, multi-level design produces more stable models in the training phase wherein over fitting was reduced. © 2015 IEEE.","Artificial Neural Network; Computer-assisted diagnosis; multi-model multi-level systems; pattern recognition; skin lesion detection","Artificial intelligence; Computer aided diagnosis; Dermatology; Feature extraction; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Computer assisted diagnosis; Confidence levels; Design and evaluations; Feature extraction techniques; Multi-level designs; Multi-level systems; Multimodel systems; Skin lesion; Computer architecture",,,,,,,,"Arifin, S., Kibria, G., Firoze, A., Amin, A., Yan, H., Dermatological disease diagnosis using color-skin images (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, pp. 15-17; Chang, C., Liao, H., Automatic facial skin defects detection and recognition system (2011) Paper Presented at Fifth International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computing; Fujii, H., Yanagisawa, T., Mitsui, M., Murakami, Y., Yamaguchi, M., Ohyama, N., Abe, T., Kubota, Y., Extraction of acne lesion in acne patients from multispectral Images (2008) Paper Presented at 30th Annual International IEEE EMBS Conference, , Vancouver, August 20-24 2008; Gershenson, C., Artificial Neural Networks for Beginners, , http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0308/0308031.pdf, arvix.org.

Objective We performed a longitudinal analysis of the relevance of the atopic endotype from birth to age 13 years. Methods Allergic sensitization against 28 inhalant and food allergens was assessed at, 1, 4, 6, and 13 years of age in 399 children from the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood2000 birth cohort by using both skin prick test responses and specific IgE levels. Asthma and eczema were diagnosed longitudinally by strictly adhering to predefined algorithms. Associations between allergic sensitization, asthma, and eczema were estimated by means of logistic regression, and a machine learning approach was used to identify temporal phenotype clusters of these traits. Results Allergic sensitization showed no association with asthma through early childhood (0-6 years) when analyzed as any sensitization (odds ratio [OR] range, 0.78-1.29; P ≥.48). However, at 13 years of age, any sensitization was associated with asthma (OR range, 4.02-5.94; all P &lt;.001). In contrast, any sensitization was associated with eczema at , 1, and 6 years of age (OR range, 2.06-6.02; P ≤.01) and borderline associated at 4 years of age (OR, 1.61 [95% CI, 0.96-2.69]; P =.07) but not at 13 years of age (OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 0.78-3.16]; P =.21). We identified 4 latent patterns of disease development that were either dominated by sensitization (37%), eczema (26%), asthma (14%), or healthy status (24%). Conclusion We found very little interdependency between asthma, eczema, and allergic sensitization through childhood. The associations between those entities were strongly dependent on age, type of allergens, and method of testing for sensitization. Therefore, atopy in children is unlikely to represent a true endotype. © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","asthma; children; eczema; Endotype; sensitization; skin prick test; specific IgE","immunoglobulin E; allergen; immunoglobulin E; adolescent; age; allergy; Article; asthma; child; childhood disease; controlled study; disease association; disease course; eczema; female; human; immunoglobulin blood level; infant; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; preschool child; prick test; priority journal; skin test; asthma; eczema; Hypersensitivity, Immediate; immunization; immunology; prevalence; prospective study; socioeconomics; Adolescent; Age Factors; Allergens; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Eczema; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity, Immediate; Immunization; Immunoglobulin E; Infant; Male; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Skin Tests; Socioeconomic Factors",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Allergens; Immunoglobulin E",,,"Lundbeckfonden: R16-A1694

Our data come from patients who underwent Phadiatop test examinations in the University Hospital of Ostrava, the Department of Work and preventive medicine. As predictive variables for discriminant analysis, personal and family anamnesis, sex and age of the patient were selected and appropriately rated. These data were obtained on the spot assessment of the manifestations of atopy. Both of these anamneses were divided into four categories according to severity ranked by doctors (asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, and others). Evaluation was based on the test results. One of two possible values is involved there: 0 for Phadiatop test result 0 and I, or 1 for values II to VI. Both methods provide very similar results with the success rate 64% for correct classification of patients. Model was tested using a database of 274 clients. Both methods used statistically significant diseases which influence the Phadiatop test results - asthma and allergic rhinitis - in personal anamnesis. © 2015 IEEE.","CHAID algortihm; decission tree; logistic regression; Phadiatop test","Algorithms; Data mining; Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Diseases; Regression analysis; Testing; Allergic rhinitis; CHAID algortihm; decission tree; Logistic regressions; On the spots; Ostrava; Predictive variables; Preventive medicines; Trees (mathematics)",,,,,,,,"Hajduková, Z., Vantuchová, Y., Klimková, P., Makhoul, M., Hromádka, R., Atopy in patiens with allergic contact dermatitis (2009) Jurnal of Czech Physicians Occupational Therapy, (2), pp. 69-73. , http://www.prolek/.cz/caSopiS-lekaru-ceskych-clanek?id=5780, In Czech; Hajduková, Z., Pólová, J., Kosek, V., The importance of Atopy Investigation in the Department of Travel Medicine (2005) Allergies: Magazine for Continuous Education in Allergy and Ctimcal Immunology, (2), pp. 106-109. , http://www.tigis.cz/alergie/alergie_2_2005/obsah_f.htm, In Czech; Brock, W.P., Siegel, C., Portnoy, J., Efficacy of a single diagnostic test for sensitization to common inhalant allergens (2001) Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, pp. 196-202. , 86.2; Sigurs, N., Asthma and allergy patterns over 18 years after severe RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of life (2010) Thorax, pp. 1045-1052. , 65.12; Wuthrich, B., Prevalence of atopy and pollinosis in the adult population of Switzerland (SAPALDIA study) (2010) International Archives of Allergy and Immunology, pp. 149-156. , 106.2; Wuthrich, B., IgE levels, atopy markers and hay fever in relation to age, sex and smoking status in a normal adult Swiss population (2009) International Archives of Allergy and Immunology, pp. 396-402. , 111.4; Hosmer, D.W., Lemeshow, S., (2000) Applied Logistic Regression, , NewYork: Wiley -Interscience; Menard, S., (2009) Logisti Regression from Introductorz to Advanced Concepts and Applications, , SAGE Publications Inc; Kuráñová, P., Hajduková, Z., The Use of Logistic and Ordinal Regression for the Prediction of the Phadiatop Test Results (2013) Sborník Konference the Ninth International Conference on Digital Technologies Žihna, pp. 111-115; Nisbet, R., Elder, J.F., Miner, G., (2009) Handbook of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Applications, , Boston.

Limited evidence has shown the association of DNA methylation (DNA-M) with eczema. We explored this association at the epigenome-scale to better understand the role of DNA-M. Data from the first generation (F<inf>1</inf>) of the Isle of Wight (IoW) birth cohort participants and the second generation (F<inf>2</inf>) were examined in our study. Epigenome-scale DNA methylation of F<inf>1</inf> at age 18 years and F<inf>2</inf> in cord blood was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip. A total of 307,357 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) in the F<inf>1</inf> generation were screened via recursive random forest (RF) for their potential association with eczema at age 18. Functional enrichment and pathway analysis of resulting genes were carried out using DAVID gene functional classification tool. Log-linear models were performed in F<inf>1</inf> to corroborate the identified CpGs. Findings in F<inf>1</inf> were further replicated in F<inf>2</inf>. Results: The recursive RF yielded 140 CpGs, 88 of which showed statistically significant associations with eczema at age 18, corroborated by log-linear models after controlling for false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. These CpGs were enriched among many biological pathways, including pathways related to creating transcriptional variety and pathways mechanistically linked to eczema such as cadherins, cell adhesion, gap junctions, tight junctions, melanogenesis, and apoptosis. In the F<inf>2</inf> generation, about half of the 83 CpGs identified in F<inf>1</inf> showed the same direction of association with eczema risk as in F<inf>1</inf>, of which two CpGs were significantly associated with eczema risk, cg04850479 of the PROZ gene (risk ratio (RR) = 15.1 in F<inf>1</inf>, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.71, 79.5; RR = 6.82 in F<inf>2</inf>, 95 % CI 1.52, 30.62) and cg01427769 of the NEU1 gene (RR = 0.13 in F<inf>1</inf>, 95 % CI 0.03, 0.46; RR = 0.09 in F<inf>2</inf>, 95 % CI 0.03, 0.36). Conclusions: Via epigenome-scaled analyses using recursive RF followed by log-linear models, we identified 88 CpGs associated with eczema in F<inf>1</inf>, of which 41 were replicated in F<inf>2</inf>. Several identified CpGs are located within genes in biological pathways relating to skin barrier integrity, which is central to the pathogenesis of eczema. Novel genes associated with eczema risk were identified (e.g., the PROZ and NEU1 genes). © 2015, Quraishi et al.","Allergic disease; CpG; DNA methylation; Eczema; Epigenetics; Epigenome-scale; F<inf>1</inf> and F<inf>2</inf> generations; Random forest","cadherin; adult; analytical parameters; apoptosis; Article; cell adhesion; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; CpG island; DNA methylation; eczema; epigenetics; epigenome scale DNA methylation; false discovery rate; female; gap junction; gene; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic screening; genetic transcription; genetic variability; human; male; melanogenesis; NEU1 gene; onset age; pathogenesis; phenotype; prevalence; priority journal; PROZ gene; random forest; sex difference; tight junction; umbilical cord blood; United Kingdom",,,,,"R01 HL082925-01",,,"Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis (2010) Ann Dermatol, 22 (2), pp. 125-137. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXpvVKrtbc%3D, PID: 20548901; Leung, D.Y.M., Boguniewicz, M., Howell, M.D., Nomura, I., Hamid, Q.A., New insights into atopic dermatitis (2004) J Clin Invest, 113 (5), pp. 651-657. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2cXhvFOksrY%3D, PID: 14991059; Gupta, R., Sheikh, A., Strachan, D., Anderson, H., Burden of allergic disease in the UK: secondary analyses of national databases (2004) Clin Exp Allergy, 34 (4), pp. 520-526. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD2c7osFCrug%3D%3D, PID: 15080802; Arshad, S.H., Hide, D.W., Effect of environmental factors on the development of allergic disorders in infancy (1992) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 90 (2), pp. 235-241. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK38zmsVWrtQ%3D%3D, PID: 1500628; Hanifin, J., Rajka, G., Diagnostic features of atopic eczema (1980) Acta Dermatol Venereol (Stockh), 92, pp. 44-47; Orteu, C., Rustin, M., O’toole, E., Sabin, C., Salmon, M., Poulter, L., The inhibition of cutaneous T cell apoptosis may prevent resolution of inflammation in atopic eczema (2000) Clin Exp Immunol, 122 (2), pp. 150-156. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD3M%2FltVWgtg%3D%3D, PID: 11091268; Bibikova, M., Fan J-B.

Clinical efficacy and adverse events (AE) data were included in the model based on a thorough literature review. All localized direct treatment costs, including drug cost, AE costs, and medical treatment costs for underlining diseases were included from a Chinese third party payer perspective. A Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) survey was conducted with 20 senior physicians specialized in respiratory, ENT, allergy, and immunology fields from tertiary hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shenyang, and Wuhan to validate the local treatment costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated based on the above efficacy and cost information.Results: OM-85 is a cost-effective therapy when compared with placebo (standard care). OM-85 can treat/prevent one additional full episode exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and one additional full episode exacerbation of rhinosinusitis with only additional costs of RMB 653 and RMB 1182.84, respectively. In comparison, each acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis will cost RMB 4510.10, and each acute exacerbation of rhinosinuisitis will cost RMB 1807.21 in a Chinese clinical management setting. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed and the ICER result was demonstrated to be consistent.Conclusions: OM 85 reduces acute exacerbations among patients with chronic bronchitis and chronic rhinosinusitis when compared with Placebo (standard care). From a Chinese payer perspective, OM 85 is a cost-effective therapy in the clinical management of both chronic bronchitis and rhinosinusitis in the adult population. © 2014 All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.","China; Chronic bronchitis; Cost-effectiveness; Respiratory tract infections","bacterium lysate; placebo; Broncho-Vaxom; cell extract; immunological adjuvant; Article; asthma; bronchitis; China; chronic bronchitis; chronic obstructive lung disease; cost effectiveness analysis; coughing; decision tree; diarrhea; disease exacerbation; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug tolerability; eczema; fever; health care cost; human; immune response; laryngitis; model; nausea; physician; rhinopharyngitis; rhinosinusitis; side effect; sinusitis; swelling; tertiary care center; upper abdominal pain; urticaria; vomiting; bronchitis; chronic disease; cost benefit analysis; economics; health care cost; Respiratory Tract Infections; rhinitis; sinusitis; statistical model; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Bronchitis; Cell Extracts; China; Chronic Disease; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Health Expenditures; Humans; Models, Econometric; Respiratory Tract Infections; Rhinitis; Sinusitis",,"bacterium lysate, 88402-38-4; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Broncho-Vaxom; Cell Extracts","om 85",,,"This study was sponsored by Vifor Pharmaceuticals.",,"Steurer-Stey, C., Bachmann, L.M., Steurer, J., Oral purified bacterial extracts in chronic bronchitis and COPD: Systematic review (2004) Chest, 126, pp. 1645-1655; Adriana Rozy, J.C.-W., Bacterial immunostimulants-mechanism of action and clinical application in respiratory diseases (2008) Pneumonologiai Alergologia Polska, 76, pp. 353-359; Benedetto, F.D., Sevieri, G., Prevention of respiratory tract infections with bacterial lysate OM-85 bronchomunal in children and adults: A state of the art (2013) Multidiscip Resp Med, 8, p. 33; Cao, P.P., Li, H.B., Wang, B.F., Distinct immunopathologic characteristics of various types of chronicrhinosinusitis in adult Chinese (2009) J Allergy ClinImmunol, 124, pp. 478-484. , 484.e1-2; Heintz, B., Schlenter, W.W., Kirsten, R., Clinical efficacy of Broncho-Vaxom in adult patients with chronic purulent sinusitis-A multi-centric, placebo-controlled, double-blind study (1989) Int J Clin Pharm Therapy Toxicol, 27, pp. 530-534; Zagar, S., Löfler-Badzek, D., Broncho-Vaxom in children with rhinosinusitis: A double-blind clinical trial (1988) ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec, 50, pp. 397-404; Huber, M., Mossmann, H., Bessler, W.G., Th1-orientated immunological properties of the bacterial extract OM-85-BV (2005) Eur J Med Res, 10, pp. 209-217; Emmerich, B., Emslander, H.P., Milatovic, D., Effects of a bacterial extract on local immunity of the lung in patients with chronic bronchitis (1990) Lung, 168, pp. 726-731; Parola, C., Salogni, L., Vaira, X., Selective activation of human dendritic cells by OM-85 through a NF-kB and MAPK dependent pathway (2013) PLoS One, 8, p. e82867; Gomez Barreto, D., De La Torre, O., Alvarez, A., Safety and efficacy of OM-85-BV plus amoxicillin/clavulanate in the treatment of subacute sinusitis and the prevention of recurrent infections in children (1998) Allergol Immunopathol (Madrid), 26, pp. 17-22; Soler, M., Mutterlein, R., Cozma, G., Doubleblind study of OM-85 in patients with chronic bronchitis or mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2007) Respiration, 74, pp. 26-32; Bergemann, R., Brandt, A., Zoellner, U., Preventive treatment of chronic bronchitis: A meta-analysis of clinical trials with a bacterial extract (OM-85 BV) and a cost-effectiveness analysis (1994) Monaldi Arch Chest Dis, 49, pp. 302-307; Collet, J.P., Ducruet, T., Haider, S., Economic impact of using an immunostimulating agent to prevent severe acute exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2001) Can Resp J, 8, pp. 27-33; Zhong, N., Wang, C., Yao, W., Prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in China: A large, population-based survey (2007) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 176, pp. 753-760; Fang, X., Wang, X., Bai, C., COPD in China: The burden and importance of proper management (2011) Chest, 139, pp. 920-929; Pessey, J.J., Megas, F., Arnould, B., Prevention of recurrent rhinopharyngitis in at-risk children in France: A cost-effectiveness model for a nonspecific immunostimulating bacterial extract (OM-85 BV) (2003) Pharmacoeconomics, 21, pp. 1053-1068","Xuan, J.; University of Florida at Gainesville, 1225 Center Drive, United States",,,"Informa Healthcare",,,,,13696998,,JMECF,"25275426","English","J.

High serum IgE level, eosinophilia, eczema, recurrent skin and lung infections constitute the immunologic profile of HIES, whereas characteristic facial appearance, scoliosis, retained primary teeth, joint hyperextensibility, bone fractures following minimal trauma and craniosynostosis are the main non- immunologic manifestations. The diagnosis of HIES cannot be made by routine immunologic tests. As the main characteristic laboratory abnormalities of this syndrome are highly elevated serum IgE levels and eosinophilia; both features have a broad spectrum of differential diagnosis. The purpose of this essay was presenting the best way for diagnosis management of HIES. Based on the genetic reports of patients of the Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI) as a single center experience, and applying project management (PM) in health care research projects, we sought the best way for a rapid diagnosis of HIES. The combination of project management principles with immunologic and genetic knowledge to better define the laboratory and clinical diagnosis lead to an improvement of the management of patients with HIES. These results are shown in one ""Decision Tree"" which is based on 342 genetic reports of the CCI during the past ten years. It is necessary to facilitate the diagnostic analysis of suspected HIES patients; applying project management in health care research projects provides a better and more accurate diagnosis eventually leading to a better patients' care.

However, recent works have highlighted the occurrence of AR in toddlers although the causes of AR in this young population remain unknown. The objective of this study was to identify determinants of AR in young children with asthma. Methods: We carried out a case-control study of 227 children with active asthma and enrolled in the Trousseau Asthma Program. AR and other allergic diseases (asthma, food allergy and eczema) were diagnosed by medical doctors using standardized questionnaires. Parental history of AR and asthma, biological markers of atopy (total IgE, blood eosinophilia, allergic sensitization towards food and aeroallergens) and environmental parameters were also collected. Results: Forty one of the children (18.1%) had AR. By univariate logistic regression analysis, AR was mainly associated with peanut sensitization (OR = 6.75; p = 0.002); food allergy (OR = 4.31; p = 0.026); mold exposure (OR = 3.81 p<0.01) and parental history of AR (OR = 1.42; p = 0.046). Due to the strong link between food allergy and peanut sensitization three models of multivariate logistic regression were performed and confirmed that AR is associated with peanut sensitization but also food allergy and mold exposure. A random forest analysis was also performed to explain AR. The results reinforced the logistic analysis that peanut sensitization and mold exposure were the principal determinants of AR. Conclusions & Clinical Relevance: These results stress the importance of investigating AR in young children with asthma to potentially diagnose a particularly severe allergic asthmatic phenotype. Moreover, these data evoke the hypothesis that peanut could be an aeroallergen. © 2014 Moussu et al.",,"allergen; biological marker; immunoglobulin E; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; Alternaria; article; asthma; atopy; case control study; cat; child; controlled study; dog; eczema; egg allergy; environmental parameters; eosinophilia; food allergy; grass pollen; house dust allergy; human; major clinical study; milk allergy; mould; peanut allergy; phenotype; questionnaire; sensitization; asthma; complication; environment; female; immediate type hypersensitivity; immunology; infant; male; multivariate analysis; preschool child; Rhinitis, Allergic; risk factor; Allergens; Asthma; Case-Control Studies; Child, Preschool; Eczema; Environment; Female; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Hypersensitivity, Immediate; Infant; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Questionnaires; Rhinitis, Allergic; Risk Factors",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Allergens",,,,,,"Strachan, D., Sibbald, B., Weiland, S., Ait-Khaled, N., Anabwani, G., Anderson, H.R., Asher, M.I., Williams, H., Worldwide variations in prevalence of symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in children: The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) (1997) Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, 8 (4), pp. 161-176; Annesi-Maesano, I., Didier, A., Klossek, M., Chanal, I., Moreau, D., Bousquet, J., The score for allergic rhinitis (SFAR): A simple and valid assessment method in population studies (2002) Allergy: European Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 57 (2), pp. 107-114. , DOI 10.1034/j.1398-9995.2002.1o3170.x; Braun-Fahrlander, C., Wuthrich, B., Gassner, M., Grize, L., Sennhauser, F.H., Varonier, H.S., Vuille, J.-C., Validation of a rhinitis symptom questionnaire (ISAAC core questions) in a population of Swiss school children visiting the school health services (1997) Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, 8 (2), pp. 75-82; Bousquet, J., Van Cauwenberge, P., Khaltaev, N., Allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma (2001) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 108, pp. S147-S334; Hellings, P.W., Fokkens, W.J., Allergic rhinitis and its impact on otorhinolaryngology (2006) Allergy: European Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 61 (6), pp. 656-664. , DOI 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2006.01109.x; Da Silva, C.H.M., Da Silva, T.E., Morales, N.M.O., Fernandes, K.P., Pinto, R.M.C., Quality of life in children and adolescents with allergic rhinitis Braz J Otorhinolaryngol, 75, pp. 642-649. , n.d; Wright, A.L., Holberg, C.J., Martinez, F.D., Halonen, M., Morgan, W., Taussig, L.M., Epidemiology of physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis in childhood (1994) Pediatrics, 94 (6 I), pp. 895-901; Rochat, M.K., Illi, S., Ege, M.J., Lau, S., Keil, T., Allergic rhinitis as a predictor for wheezing onset in school-aged children (2010) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 126, pp. 1170-1175.e2; De Groot, E.P., Nijkamp, A., Duiverman, E.J., Brand, P.L.P., Allergic rhinitis is associated with poor asthma control in children with asthma (2012) Thorax, 67, pp. 582-587; Peroni, D.G., Piacentini, G.L., Alfonsi, L., Zerman, L., Di, B.P., Visona', G., Nottegar, F., Boner, A.L., Rhinitis in pre-school children: Prevalence, association with allergic diseases and risk factors (2003) Clinical and Experimental Allergy, 33 (10), pp. 1349-1354. , DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2222.2003.01766.x; Wang, W.C., Lue, K.H., Sheu, J.N., Allergic diseases in preschool children in Taichung City Zhonghua Min Guo Xiao Er Ke Yi Xue Hui Za Zhi, 39, pp. 314-318. , n.d; Kulig, M., Klettke, U., Wahn, V., Forster, J., Bauer, C.P., Development of seasonal allergic rhinitis during the first 7 years of life (2000) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 106, pp. 832-839; Herr, M., Clarisse, B., Nikasinovic, L., Foucault, C., Le Marec, A.-M., Does allergic rhinitis exist in infancy?

We investigated the predictive ability of a spectrum of machine learning methods to disambiguate clinical sub-groups of asthma, wheeze and eczema, using a large heterogeneous set of attributes in an unselected population. The aim was to identify to what extent such heterogeneous information can be combined to reveal specific clinical manifestations. Methods. The study population comprised a cross-sectional sample of adults, and included representatives of the general population enriched by subjects with asthma. Linear and non-linear machine learning methods, from logistic regression to random forests, were fit on a large attribute set including demographic, clinical and laboratory features, genetic profiles and environmental exposures. Outcome of interest were asthma, wheeze and eczema encoded by different operational definitions. Model validation was performed via bootstrapping. Results: The study population included 554 adults, 42% male, 38% previous or current smokers. Proportion of asthma, wheeze, and eczema diagnoses was 16.7%, 12.3%, and 21.7%, respectively. Models were fit on 223 non-genetic variables plus 215 single nucleotide polymorphisms. In general, non-linear models achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than other methods, especially for asthma and wheeze, less for eczema, with areas under receiver operating characteristic curve of 84%, 76% and 64%, respectively. Our findings confirm that allergen sensitisation and lung function characterise asthma better in combination than separately. The predictive ability of genetic markers alone is limited. For eczema, new predictors such as bio-impedance were discovered. Conclusions: More usefully-complex modelling is the key to a better understanding of disease mechanisms and personalised healthcare: further advances are likely with the incorporation of more factors/attributes and longitudinal measures. © 2014 Prosperi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","allergen; Asthma; diagnostics; eczema; lung function; machine learning; model selection; single nucleotide polymorphisms; wheeze","allergen; adult; article; asthma; clinical classification; clinical feature; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; differential diagnosis; disease classification; eczema; female; genetic marker; human; lung function; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; phenotypic variation; priority journal; prognosis; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; sensitization; single nucleotide polymorphism; smoking; wheezing; artificial intelligence; asthma; biology; eczema; environment; genetics; nonlinear system; personalized medicine; phenotype; procedures; statistical model; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Asthma; Computational Biology; Eczema; Environment; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Nonlinear Dynamics; Phenotype; Precision Medicine",,,,,"G0601361

Methods: Allergen-IgE screening using ImmunoCAP ISAC® assay was performed at age 11 yrs in children participating a population-based birth cohort. Logistic regression (LR) and nonlinear statistical learning models, including random forests (RF) and Bayesian networks (BN), coupled with feature selection approaches, were used to identify patterns of allergen responses associated with asthma, rhino-conjunctivitis, wheeze, eczema and airway hyper-reactivity (AHR, positive methacholine challenge). Sensitivity/specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) were used to assess model performance via repeated validation. Results: Serum sample for IgE measurement was obtained from 461 of 822 (56.1%) participants. Two hundred and thirty-eight of 461 (51.6%) children had at least one of 112 allergen components IgE &gt; 0 ISU. The binary threshold &gt;0.3 ISU performed less well than using continuous IgE values, discretizing data or using other data transformations, but not significantly (p = 0.1). With the exception of eczema (AUROC~0.5), LR, RF and BN achieved comparable AUROC, ranging from 0.76 to 0.82. Dust mite, pollens and pet allergens were highly associated with asthma, whilst pollens and dust mite with rhino-conjunctivitis. Egg/bovine allergens were associated with eczema. Conclusions: After validation, LR, RF and BN demonstrated reasonable discrimination ability for asthma, rhino-conjunctivitis, wheeze and AHR, but not for eczema. However, further improvements in threshold ascertainment and/or value transformation for different components, and better interpretation algorithms are needed to fully capitalize on the potential of the technology. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

It follows a chronic course and persists up to 15 years after onset. Early detection of an exacerbation followed by the application of specific drugs for a few days can considerably reduce disease activity and avoid temporary disability. However, dermatitis patients usually rely on their own perception in assessing their skin condition and therefore often miss the time point for effective treatment.

We hypothesize that this expression does not adequately describe the natural history of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis during childhood. We propose that this paradigm arose from cross-sectional analyses of longitudinal studies, and may reflect a population pattern that may not predominate at the individual level.Data from 9,801 children in two population-based birth cohorts were used to determine individual profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis and whether the manifestations of these symptoms followed an atopic march pattern. Children were assessed at ages 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 y. We used Bayesian machine learning methods to identify distinct latent classes based on individual profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis. This approach allowed us to identify groups of children with similar patterns of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis over time.Using a latent disease profile model, the data were best described by eight latent classes: no disease (51.3%), atopic march (3.1%), persistent eczema and wheeze (2.7%), persistent eczema with later-onset rhinitis (4.7%), persistent wheeze with later-onset rhinitis (5.7%), transient wheeze (7.7%), eczema only (15.3%), and rhinitis only (9.6%). When latent variable modelling was carried out separately for the two cohorts, similar results were obtained. Highly concordant patterns of sensitisation were associated with different profiles of eczema, rhinitis, and wheeze. The main limitation of this study was the difference in wording of the questions used to ascertain the presence of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis in the two cohorts.The developmental profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis are heterogeneous; only a small proportion of children (∼7% of those with symptoms) follow trajectory profiles resembling the atopic march.Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary. © 2014 Belgrave et al.",,"allergy; Article; Bayesian learning; child; cohort analysis; disease severity; eczema; female; follow up; human; longitudinal study; population research; preschool child; prevalence; probability; questionnaire; rhinitis; school child; sensitization; skin test; symptom assessment; wheezing; Bayes theorem; cross-sectional study; eczema; male; pathology; Respiratory Sounds; rhinitis; Bayes Theorem; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Eczema; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Respiratory Sounds; Rhinitis",,,,,"0401540

We set out to define distinct allergic phenotypes by unsupervised cluster analysis. Study design A total of 18 variables were analyzed: sex and age, eczema and food allergy, asthma duration, asthma severity and control, severe exacerbations, total IgE level, allergic sensitization, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and functional parameters. Clusters obtained were cross-tabulated with environmental parameters. Results Four clusters were identified in 125 children (average age 8.9 years): (1) 57 children constituted the ""House dust mite Sensitization and Mild Asthma"" cluster, 98% of these were monosensitized and had mild asthma (74%); (2) 12 children had ""Pollen Sensitization with Severe Exacerbations,"" 92 % with severe exacerbations and pollen sensitization; (3) 20 children had ""Multiple Allergies and Severe Asthma,"" with 95% having moderate to severe asthma, and a significantly decreased forced expiratory flow rate at 25%-75% of forced vital capacity, 100% had eczema and higher values of IgE (1123 kU/L) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (67 ppb) (this cluster was associated with molds at home [P =.004]); and (4) 36 children had ""Multiple Allergic Sensitizations and Mild Asthma,"" 97% of these with multiple sensitizations and 100% mild asthma. Conclusions The identification of 2 novel severe allergic asthma phenotypes ""Pollen Sensitization with Severe Exacerbations""and ""Multiple Allergies and Severe Asthma"" could lead to specific targeted treatment. © 2014 Mosby Inc.

Infants were followed from the age of 5 weeks until 3 years of age. During this time, the number of children with AD who were treated with verum or placebo was observed at eight visits. Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed at different time points. Methods: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial performed in Germany included 606 newborns. After randomization, n = 303 patients were classified in the placebo group and n = 303 in the verum group. A total of 119 participants left the study, so data from n = 250 patients of the placebo group and n = 237 patients of the verum group were available for analysis. At the beginning of the study, newborns were treated prophylactically with bacterial lysate or placebo for 26 weeks. After this, children were observed until the age of 3 years. A systematic literature research was done to evaluate treatment costs of atopic eczema in newborn/small children. Finally, 17 publications were included and checked for searched treatment costs of AD. A study was then initiated to evaluate the direct costs to statutory health insurance. Based on the described clinical trial, a decision tree model was developed. Using the evaluated direct costs and prevalence according to the clinical trial, the developed model can be used in cost-effectiveness analyses. Results: The focus of the analyses was on the subgroup ""single heredity for atopy"" in clinical trials. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed an advantage for bacterial lysate after 3 years. To further support this result a model extension was executed; the model was expanded from 3 to 6 years. Cost-effectiveness of bacterial lysate was also proven after 6 years. Conclusion: Prophylactic treatment with bacterial lysate of infants with single heredity for atopy for 26 weeks in the 1st year of life is cost-effective at the age of 3 and 6 years, i.e. prophylactic use of bacterial lysate generated lower costs by leading to lower prevalence compared to placebo. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Atopic dermatitis; Cost-effectiveness; Decision tree; Enterococus faecalis; Escherichia coli; Model; Newborns; Prophylactic treatment; Small children; Sterile bacterial lysate","bacterium lysate; placebo; article; atopic dermatitis; child; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; decision tree; double blind procedure; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; female; health insurance; human; infant; major clinical study; male; newborn; preschool child; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; sensitivity analysis; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Cell Extracts; Child; Child, Preschool; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Double-Blind Method; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Models, Economic",,"bacterium lysate, 88402-38-4",,,,,,"Benedetto, A.D., Agnihothri, R., Mc Grit, L., Bankova, L.G., Beck, L.A., Atopic dermatitis: A disease caused by innate immune defects?

Some of the inconsistency is caused by the variable selection and demographic and clinical differences among study populations. Objectives: To investigate the effects of the choice of statistical method and different preparations of data on the clustering results; and to relate these to disease severity. Methods: Several variants of EFA and HC were applied and compared using various sets of variables and different encodings and transformations within a dataset of 383 children with asthma. Variables included lung function, inflammatory and allergy markers, family history, environmental exposures, and medications. Clusters and original variables were related to asthma severity (logistic regression and Bayesian network analysis). Measurements and Main Results: EFA identified five components (eigenvalues≥1) explaining 35% of the overall variance. Variations of the HC (as linkage-distance functions) did not affect the cluster inference; however, using different variable encodings and transformations did. The derived clusters predicted asthma severity less than the original variables. Prognostic factors of severity were medication usage, current symptoms, lung function, paternal asthma, bodymass index, and age of asthma onset. Bayesian networks indicated conditional dependence among variables. Conclusions: The use of different unsupervised statistical learning methods and different variable sets and encodings can lead to multiple and inconsistent subgroupings of asthma, not necessarily correlated with severity. The search for asthma phenotypes needs more careful selection of markers, consistent across different study populations, and more cautious interpretation of results from unsupervised learning.

However, a detailed understanding of how such factors act together is lacking. To elucidate the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in allergic diseases, we used a novel bioinformatics approach that combines feature selection and machine learning. In two materials, PARSIFAL (a European cross-sectional study of 3113 children) and BAMSE (a Swedish birth-cohort including 2033 children), genetic variants as well as environmental and lifestyle factors were evaluated for their contribution to allergic phenotypes. Monte Carlo feature selection and rule based models were used to identify and rank rules describing how combinations of genetic and environmental factors affect the risk of allergic diseases. Novel interactions between genes were suggested and replicated, such as between ORMDL3 and RORA, where certain genotype combinations gave odds ratios for current asthma of 2.1 (95% CI 1.2-3.6) and 3.2 (95% CI 2.0-5.0) in the BAMSE and PARSIFAL children, respectively. Several combinations of environmental factors appeared to be important for the development of allergic disease in children. For example, use of baby formula and antibiotics early in life was associated with an odds ratio of 7.4 (95% CI 4.5-12.0) of developing asthma. Furthermore, genetic variants together with environmental factors seemed to play a role for allergic diseases, such as the use of antibiotics early in life and COL29A1 variants for asthma, and farm living and NPSR1 variants for allergic eczema. Overall, combinations of environmental and life style factors appeared more frequently in the models than combinations solely involving genes. In conclusion, a new bioinformatics approach is described for analyzing complex data, including extensive genetic and environmental information. Interactions identified with this approach could provide useful hints for further in-depth studies of etiological mechanisms and may also strengthen the basis for risk assessment and prevention. © 2013 Bornelöv et al.",,"antibiotic agent; agricultural land; allergic asthma; allergic disease; allergic eczema; article; artificial milk; asthma; bioinformatics; child; childhood allergy; childhood disease; eczema; environmental factor; genetic variability; genotype; heredity; human; lifestyle; machine learning; Monte Carlo method; non allergic eczema; pathogenesis; phenotype; rhinoconjunctivitis; single nucleotide polymorphism; wheezing; Adolescent; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Computational Biology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environment; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Life Style; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk",,,,,,,,"Asher, M.I., Montefort, S., Bjorksten, B., Lai, C.K., Strachan, D.P., Weiland, S.K., Williams, H., Worldwide time trends in the prevalence of symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema in childhood: ISAAC Phases One and Three repeat multicountry cross-sectional surveys (2006) Lancet, 368 (9537), pp. 733-743. , DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69283-0, PII S0140673606692830; Von Hertzen, L.C., Haahtela, T., Asthma and atopy - The price of affluence?

We retrospectively analyzed 439 consecutive HCT procedures for malignant hematologic disorders performed at our institution between January 2005 and December 2012; 192 patients underwent 430 cutaneous biopsies. The clinical and dermatopathologic diagnosis differed in 240 cases (56%). Biopsy results led to a change in therapy in 69 (16%) episodes. Seventeen of 69 management changes occurred in response to a clinical diagnosis of graft-versus-host disease and resulted in augmentation of systemic immunosuppression. The management was modified with similar frequencies with respect to concordance or discordance between the clinical and histopathologic diagnosis (P=51). We used classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, a decision-modeling technique, to predict the biopsy yield as expressed by impact on clinical management in the allogeneic and autologous setting. The models were cross-validated and then tested against a validation subset, and they maintained a high negative predictive value and high specificity. Although skin biopsies may not be mandatory for either diagnostic or therapeutic reasons, in carefully chosen circumstances, this procedure can yield extremely important data. We believe a prospective study should be undertaken to evaluate current practice data and to validate our decision tree models. © 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.","Classification and regression tree analysis; Decision modeling; Graft-versus-host disease; Hematopoietic cell transplantation; Skin biopsy","antifungal agent; antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; antivirus agent; immunosuppressive agent; acantholysis; acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis; acute granulocytic leukemia; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adenoma; adult; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; aplastic anemia; arthropod disease; article; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; bleeding; cancer chemotherapy; chronic lymphatic leukemia; chronic myeloid leukemia; controlled study; debridement; decision tree; drug eruption; eczema; electronic medical record; female; graft recipient; graft versus host reaction; hemangiokeratoma; hematopoietic cell; histopathology; Hodgkin disease; human; human cell; hyperpigmentation; immunosuppressive treatment; leukemia; lichenoid; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; medical record review; multiple myeloma; myeloablative conditioning; myelodysplastic syndrome; myelofibrosis; necrosis; nevus; nonhodgkin lymphoma; nonmyeloablative conditioning; predictive value; purpura; reduced intensity conditioning; retrospective study; scar; scleromyxedema; seborrheic keratosis; skin biopsy; skin cancer; skin infection; ulcer; umbilical cord blood; urticaria; whole body radiation; Classification and regression tree analysis; Decision modeling; Graft-versus-host disease; Hematopoietic cell transplantation; Skin biopsy; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Biopsy; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Skin; Skin Diseases; Young Adult",,,,,,,,"Copelan, E.A., Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (2006) NEngland J Med, 354, pp. 1813-1826; Filipovich, A.H., Weisdorf, D., Pavletic, S., National Institutes of Health consensus development project on criteria for clinical trials in chronic graft-versus-host disease: I.

For example, most dermatologists prescribe the biopsy to diagnose them. This is a simple method to identify the type of skin disease, but that is an invasive method, and in prolonged time leads to pain and discomfort for patients. Another method that can be used to diagnose is based on non-ionizing radiation such as acoustic or ultrasound waves, which is being investigated in this study. It should be noted that ultrasound imaging is one of the best and useful medical diagnostic tool to scan soft tissue. Therefore, the aim of this study is to diagnose the diseases by studying and analyzing sonography images using intelligent artificial neural network, in order to eliminate any need for radiography and pathobiology process in dermatology. Our main diagnostic tool in this study is a sonography image acquisition system that uses non-ionizing ultrasound waves for skin imaging. Intelligent artificial neural network has been used to study and intelligently classify the skin sonograms. The results of this study show the high capability of this method in diagnosis and classification of the skin diseases. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","Classification; Image processing; Neural network; Skin disease; Ultrasound","Classification (of information); Computer aided network analysis; Dermatology; Diagnostic products; Diseases; Image processing; Ionizing radiation; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Ultrasonic waves; Ultrasonics; Ultrasonography; Basal cell carcinoma; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Image acquisition systems; Intelligent classification; Medical diagnostic tools; Nonionizing radiation; Skin disease; Squamous cell carcinoma; Computer aided diagnosis",,,,,,,,"Jovanović, D., Paravina, M., Spalević, L., Stanojević, M., Characteristics of malignant melanoma examined by 20-MHz ultrasound (1998) Sci J FACTA Univ Med Biol, 5 (1), pp. 58-60; Dawid, M., Czerny, C., Dudczak, R., Kletter, K., Becherer, A., Diagnostic imaging in Merkel cell carcinoma: lessons to learn from 16 cases with correlation of sonography, CT, MRI and PET (2010) Eur J Radiol, 73, pp. 317-323; Wright, C.I., Kroner, C.I., Draijer, R., Appraisal of state-of-the-art non-invasive methods and stimuli for evaluating the skin's micro circulation (2006) J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods, 54, pp. 1-25; Wortsman, X., Wortsman, J., Clinical usefulness of variable-frequency ultrasound in localized lesions of the skin (2010) JAM ACAD Dermatol, 62 (2), pp. 247-256; Gambichler, T., Regeniter, P., Bechara, F.G., Orlikov, A., Vasa, R., Moussa, G., Cker, M.S., Hoffmann, K., Characterization of benign and malignant melanocytic skin lesions using optical coherence tomography in vivo (2007) JAM ACAD Dermatol, 57 (4), pp. 629-637; Kong, L., Caspall, J., Duckworth, M., Sprigle, S., Assessment of an ultrasonic dermal scanner for skin thickness measurements (2008) Med Eng Phys, 30, pp. 804-807; Liu, H., Li, S., Pan, W., Wang, Y., Han, F., Yao, H., Investigation into the potential of low-frequency ultrasound facilitated topical delivery of Cyclosporin A (2006) Int J Pharm, 326, pp. 32-38; http://www.Episcan.com, Accessed 26 June 2010; Alam, A., White, L.E., Martin, N., Witherspoon, J., Yoo, J., West, D.P., Ultrasound tightening of facial and neck skin: a rater-blinded prospective cohort study (2010) JAM ACAD Dermatol, 62 (2), pp. 262-269; Schmid, M., Wendtner, D.-M., Ultrasound technology in dermatology (2008) Technol Dermatol Dermatol Surg, 27 (1), pp. 44-51; Saniee, E., (2006) Personal Identification Based on Infrared Hand Vein Pattern Using Wavelet Transform and Neural Network, , Dissertation: Amirkabir University of Technology; (1984) Matlab R2010b documentation, , The MathWorks, Inc USA.

Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to all patients presenting to St. John Eye Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. Questionnaire included data on demographic characteristics and potential risk factors. Patients were divided into two groups: cases with KC, in at least one eye, who were diagnosed by the attending ophthalmologist on the basis of abnormal corneal topography and at least one of the common signs of the disease; and controls presenting for problems other than KC and free of systemic and ocular conditions associated with KC. Multivariate logistic analyses were performed to identify risk factors for KC. Results: Seventy cases and 140 controls participated in the study. Groups were similar with respect to sex and age. Univariate analyses found a significant association between KC and parental first-cousin consanguinity, eye rubbing, allergy, positive family history, education (>12 years), and sunglass wear, whereas asthma, eczema, smoking, and second-cousin consanguinity were not. Multivariate analyses showed that total consanguinity (first-cousin and second-cousin) (adjusted odds ratio, 3.96; p = 0.001), eye rubbing and absence of sunglass wear were significant risk factors. Education was also associated with KC, but family history was not so in the multivariate analysis. Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis that consanguinity is a significant risk factor for KC and provides strong support for a genetic contribution to the disease. Wearing sunglasses in this environment is beneficial, and the study confirmed that eye rubbing, allergy, and education are also significantly associated with KC after adjusting for other predictors. © 2013 American Academy of Optometry.","allergy; consanguinity; eye rubbing; keratoconus; sunglasses","consanguinity; Corneal topography; Demographic characteristics; eye rubbing; keratoconus; Multi variate analysis; sunglasses; Univariate analysis; Fault tolerant computer systems; Multivariant analysis; Natural language processing systems; Surveys; Allergies; adolescent; adult; comparative study; consanguinity; female; follow up; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; incidence; Israel; keratoconus; male; procedures; questionnaire; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; young adult; article; Israel; keratoconus; methodology; risk assessment; Adolescent; Adult; Consanguinity; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Incidence; Israel; Keratoconus; Male; Questionnaires; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Consanguinity; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Incidence; Israel; Keratoconus; Male; Questionnaires; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Young Adult",,,,,,,,"Krachmer, J.H., Feder, R.S., Belin, M.W., Keratoconus and related noninflammatory corneal thinning disorders (1984) Surv Ophthalmol, 28, pp. 293-322; Rabinowitz, Y.S., The genetics of keratoconus (2003) Ophthalmol Clin North Am, 16, pp. 607-620; Edwards, M., McGhee, C.N., Dean, S., The genetics of keratoconus (2001) Clin Experiment Ophthalmol, 29, pp. 345-351; Sugar, J., Macsai, M.S., (2012) What Causes Keratoconus?

In this study a new method for asthma outcome prediction, which is based on Principal Component Analysis and Least Square Support Vector Machine Classifier, is presented. Most of the asthma cases appear during the first years of life. Thus, the early identification of young children being at high risk of developing persistent symptoms of the disease throughout childhood is an important public health priority. Methods. The proposed intelligent system consists of three stages. At the first stage, Principal Component Analysis is used for feature extraction and dimension reduction. At the second stage, the pattern classification is achieved by using Least Square Support Vector Machine Classifier. Finally, at the third stage the performance evaluation of the system is estimated by using classification accuracy and 10-fold cross-validation. Results. The proposed prediction system can be used in asthma outcome prediction with 95.54 % success as shown in the experimental results. Conclusions. This study indicates that the proposed system is a potentially useful decision support tool for predicting asthma outcome and that some risk factors enhance its predictive ability. © 2013 E.

Prediction and evaluation of the potential allergenicity is of importance for safety evaluation of foods and other environment factors. Although several computational approaches for assessing the potential allergenicity of proteins have been developed, their performance and relative merits and shortcomings have not been compared systematically.Results: To evaluate and improve the existing methods for allergen prediction, we collected an up-to-date definitive dataset consisting of 989 known allergens and massive putative non-allergens. The three most widely used allergen computational prediction approaches including sequence-, motif- and SVM-based (Support Vector Machine) methods were systematically compared using the defined parameters and we found that SVM-based method outperformed the other two methods with higher accuracy and specificity. The sequence-based method with the criteria defined by FAO/WHO (FAO: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; WHO: World Health Organization) has higher sensitivity of over 98%, but having a low specificity. The advantage of motif-based method is the ability to visualize the key motif within the allergen. Notably, the performances of the sequence-based method defined by FAO/WHO and motif eliciting strategy could be improved by the optimization of parameters. To facilitate the allergen prediction, we integrated these three methods in a web-based application proAP, which provides the global search of the known allergens and a powerful tool for allergen predication. Flexible parameter setting and batch prediction were also implemented. The proAP can be accessed at http://gmobl.sjtu.edu.cn/proAP/main.html.Conclusions: This study comprehensively evaluated sequence-, motif- and SVM-based computational prediction approaches for allergens and optimized their parameters to obtain better performance. These findings may provide helpful guidance for the researchers in allergen-prediction. Furthermore, we integrated these methods into a web application proAP, greatly facilitating users to do customizable allergen search and prediction. © 2013 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Better performance;

Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Setting: Tertiary care hospitals in Boston, including Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. Participants: We identified 3568 individuals with AA seen in the Partners health care system in Boston between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2011. We performed comprehensive searches of the Research Patient Data Repository using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 704.01. We randomly selected 350 patients and manually reviewed their medical records to train and validate a novel artificial intelligence program. This program then used natural language processing to review free-text medical records and confirm a diagnosis of AA. To confirm the algorithm, we manually reviewed a subset of records and found 93.9%validity. Main outcomes and measures: The prevalence of comorbid conditionswas assessed. Results: Common comorbid conditions included autoimmune diagnoses (thyroid disease in 14.6%, diabetes mellitus in 11.1%, inflammatory bowel disease in 6.3%, systemic lupus erythematosus in 4.3%, rheumatoid arthritis in 3.9%, and psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in 2.0%), atopy (allergic rhinitis, asthma, and/or eczema in 38.2%and contact dermatitis and other eczema in 35.9%), and mental health problems (depression or anxiety in 25.5%). We also found high prevalences of hyperlipidemia (24.5%), hypertension (21.9%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (17.3%). This profile was different from that seen in a comparison psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis group. Conclusions and relevance: We found a high prevalence of comorbid conditions among individuals with AA presenting to academic medical centers in Boston. Physicians caring for patients with AA should consider screening for comorbid conditions. © 2013 American Medical Association.",,"adult; allergic rhinitis; alopecia areata; American Indian; anemia; anxiety disorder; article; Asian; asthma; atopy; autoimmune disease; Caucasian; clinical evaluation; comorbidity; contact dermatitis; cross-sectional study; depression; diabetes mellitus; eczema; enteritis; female; gastroesophageal reflux; Hispanic; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; major clinical study; male; mental disease; Negro; prevalence; priority journal; psoriasis; psoriatic arthritis; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; systemic lupus erythematosus; tertiary health care; thyroid disease; United States; vitiligo",,,,,,,,"Alkhalifah, A., Alsantali, A., Wang, E., McElwee, K.J., Shapiro, J., Alopecia areata update, part I: Clinical picture, histopathology, and pathogenesis (2010) J Am Acad Dermatol., 62 (2), pp. 177-190; Gilhar, A., Etzioni, A., Paus, R., Alopecia areata (2012) N Engl J Med., 366 (16), pp. 1515-1525; Barahmani, N., Schabath, M.B., Duvic, M., History of atopy or autoimmunity increases risk of alopecia areata (2009) J Am Acad Dermatol., 61 (4), pp. 581-591. , National Alopecia Areata Registry; Cunliffe, W.J., Hall, R., Stevenson, C.J., Weightman, D., Alopecia areata, thyroid disease and autoimmunity (1969) Br J Dermatol., 81 (12), pp. 877-881; Du Vivier, A., Munro, D.D., Alopecia areata, autoimmunity, and Down's syndrome (1975) Br Med J., 1 (5951), pp. 191-192; Grandolfo, M., Biscazzi, A.M., Pipoli, M., Alopecia areata and autoimmunity (2008) G Ital Dermatol Venereol., 143 (5), pp. 277-281; Gu, S.Q., Ros, A.M., Von Stedingk, L.V., Thyresson, N., Wasserman, J., T cell subpopulations and their functions in vitro: A study in patients with alopecia areata and alopecia universalis (1981) Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol., 66 (2), pp. 208-217; Hann, S.K., Koo, S.W., Kim, J.B., Park, Y.K., Detection of antibodies to human melanoma cells in vitiligo and alopecia areata by Western blot analysis (1996) J Dermatol., 23 (2), pp. 100-103; Hordinsky, M., Ericson, M., Autoimmunity: Alopecia areata (2004) J Investig Dermatol Symp Proc., 9 (1), pp. 73-78; Kalish, R.S., Clues from alopecia areata on the role of neuropeptides in the initiation of autoimmunity (2007) J Invest Dermatol., 127 (6), pp. 1289-1291; Kalish, R.S., Gilhar, A., Alopecia areata: Autoimmunity-The evidence is compelling (2003) J Investig Dermatol Symp Proc., 8 (2), pp. 164-167; Katsinelos, P., Kountouras, J., Paroutoglou, G., Zavos, C., Alopecia areata, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and ulcerative colitis: Autoimmunity and apoptosis as common links?

When fed with certain hydrolyzed formulas for the first 4months of life, the risk was reduced by 26-45% in PP and 8-29% in intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses compared with children fed with regular cow's milk at age 6. The objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of feeding hydrolyzed formulas. Patients and Methods: Cost-effectiveness was assessed with a decision tree model programmed in TreeAge. Costs and effects over a 6-yr period were analyzed from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance (SHI) and a societal perspective at a 3% effective discount rate followed by sensitivity analyses. Results: The extensively hydrolyzed casein formula would be the most cost-saving strategy with savings of 478€ per child treated in the ITT analysis (CI95%: 12€; 852€) and 979€ in the PP analysis (95%CI: 355€; 1455€) from a societal perspective. If prevented cases are considered, the partially whey hydrolyzed formula is cost-saving (ITT -5404€, PP -6358€). From an SHI perspective, the partially whey hydrolyzed formula is cost-effective, but may also be cost-saving depending on the scenario. An extensively hydrolyzed whey formula also included into the analysis was dominated in all analyses. Conclusions: For the prevention of AE, two formulas can be cost-effective or even cost-saving. We recommend that SHI should reimburse formula feeding or at least the difference between costs for cow's milk formula and the most cost-effective formula. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Atopic dermatitis; Atopic eczema; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Hydrolyzed formula; Nutrition; Prevention","casein hydrolysate; article; artificial milk; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; economic evaluation; feeding; Germany; health insurance; human; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; milk; newborn; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; sensitivity analysis; Absenteeism; Animals; Caseins; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Double-Blind Method; Female; Germany; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant Formula; Infant, Newborn; Male; Milk; Milk Proteins; Prevalence; Protein Hydrolysates; Risk",,"casein hydrolysate, 65072-00-6; Caseins; Milk Proteins; Protein Hydrolysates; whey protein",,,,,,"Cookson, W.O., Moffatt, M.F., The genetics of atopic dermatitis (2002) Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol, 2, pp. 383-387; Fröschl, B., Arts, D., Leopold, C., (2008) [Health Technology Assessment-Topical Anti-Inflammatory Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis in Children], , Cologne: Deutsches Institut für Medizinische Dokumentation und Information; Schlaud, M., Atzpodien, K., Thierfelder, W., [Allergic diseases Results from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS)] (2007) Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz, 50, pp. 701-710; Olesen, A.B., Juul, S., Thestrup-Pedersen, K., Atopic dermatitis is increased following vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella or measles infection (2003) Acta Derm Venereol, 83, pp. 445-450; Krauth, C., Dintsios, C., Brandes, I., Wasem, J., (2005) Zeitschrift für die gesamte Versicherungswissenschaft, 94, pp. 215-216; Ring, J., Brockow, K., Abeck, D., The therapeutic concept of ""patient management"" in atopic eczema (1996) Allergy, 51, pp. 206-215; Gdalevich, M., Mimouni, D., David, M., Mimouni, M., Breast-feeding and the onset of atopic dermatitis in childhood: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies (2001) J Am Acad Dermatol, 45, pp. 520-527; Yang, Y.W., Tsai, C.L., Lu, C.Y., Exclusive breastfeeding and incident atopic dermatitis in childhood: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies (2009) Br J Dermatol, 161, pp. 373-383; Osborn, D.A., Sinn, J., Formulas containing hydrolysed protein for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants (2006) Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, , issue 3 pp. CD003664; von Berg, A., von Koletzko, S., Grübl, A., The effect of hydrolyzed cow's milk formula for allergy prevention in the first year of life: The German Infant Nutritional Intervention Study, a randomized double-blind trial (2003) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 111, pp. 533-540; von Berg, A., Filipiak-Pittroff, B., Krämer, U., Preventive effect of hydrolyzed infant formulas persist until age 6years: long-term results from the German Infant Nutritional Intervention Study (GINI) (2008) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 121, pp. 1442-1447; von Berg, A., von Koletzko, S., Grübl, A., Certain hydrolyzed formulas reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis but not that of asthma: three-year results of the German Infant Nutritional Intervention Study (2007) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 119, pp. 718-725; (2008), Statistisches Bundesamt Health: Diagnosis data of patients in hospitals (inclusive mortality and per hour cases); special series 12, series 6.2.1, 2007; Wiesbaden:; http://www.g-drg.de/cms/inek_site_de/layout/set/standard/Archiv/Systemjahr_2011_bzw._Datenjahr_2009, Institut für das Entgeldsystem im Krankenhaus: Diagnosis related groups calculation 2009, Siegburg 2011; Ehlken, B., Mohrenschlager, M., Kugland, B., Berger, K., Quednau, K., Ring, J., [Cost-of-illness study in patients suffering from atopic eczema in Germany] (2005) Hautarzt, 56, pp. 1144-1151; Krauth, C., Hessel, F., Hansmeier, T., Wasem, J., Seitz, R., Schweikert, B., [Empirical standard costs for health economic evaluation in Germany - a proposal by the working group methods in health economic evaluation] (2005) Gesundheitswesen, 67, pp. 736-746; (2010), Oral communication from Children's Rehabilitation Center Waldburg-Zeil Kliniken; Zutavern, A., Schaaf, B., von Berg, A., [Use of homeopathy and consultation by medical practitioners.

Objective: To identify phenotypes of severe recurrent wheezing and therapeutic approaches. Methods: We performed cluster analysis with 20 variables of 551 children with active asthma, younger than 36 months old, and enrolled in the Trousseau Asthma Program. Results: We identified 3 independent clusters of children with wheezing. Cluster 1, mild episodic viral wheeze (n = 327), consisted of children with wheezing related only to colds (71%), mild disease (76%), and mainly normal chest x-ray results. Cluster 2, nonatopic uncontrolled wheeze (n = 157), was characterized by moderate to severe disease (91%), uncontrolled wheezing despite high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (55%), parents with asthma, and increased levels of ferritine. Cluster 3, atopic multiple-trigger wheeze (n = 67), included more children with multiple-trigger wheeze (68%) than did clusters 1 or 2; eczema (75%); a positive result from the Phadiatop Infant test (90%); increased levels of IgE, IgA, and IgG; and abnormal results from chest x-rays. In separate analysis, 1 parameter for boys (increased total level of IgE) and 2 parameters for girls (wheezing severity and increased total level of IgE) properly classified 90% of boys and 83% of girls in the appropriate cluster. Significant associations were found between overcrowding, molds and cockroaches at home, and atopic multiple-trigger wheeze and between day-care attendance and nonatopic uncontrolled wheeze in other parts. Conclusion: We identified different phenotypes of recurrent wheezing in young children by using cluster analysis with usual variables. These phenotypes require confirmation in longer, follow-up studies. © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","allergy; ICS; preschool children; Risk factors","alpha 1 antitrypsin; ferritin; fluticasone; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin G; abnormal laboratory result; allergic rhinitis; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; classification; cluster analysis; cockroach; common cold; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; disease severity; drug megadose; female; follow up; food allergy; groups by age; home environment; human; immunoassay; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; mould; neutrophil; parent; patient compliance; Phadiatop Infant test; phenotype; preschool child; priority journal; random forest; recurrent disease; risk factor; sex difference; thorax radiography; treatment outcome; virus infection; wheezing",,"alpha 1 antitrypsin, 9041-92-3; ferritin, 9007-73-2; fluticasone, 90566-53-3; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9",,,,,,"Illi, S., Von Mutius, E., Lau, S., Niggemann, B., Gruber, C., Wahn, U., Perennial allergen sensitisation early in life and chronic asthma in children: A birth cohort study (2006) Lancet, 368 (9537), pp. 763-770. , DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69286-6, PII S0140673606692866; Martinez, F.D., Wright, A.L., Taussig, L.M., Holberg, C.J., Halonen, M., Morgan, W.J., Asthma and wheezing in the first six years of life.

Methods: We developed a microarray immunoassay containing 103 allergens to study the IgE reactivity profiles of 485 asthmatic and 342 non-asthmatic individuals belonging to families whose members have a documented history of asthma and atopy. We employed k-means clustering, to investigate whether a particular IgE reactivity profile correlated with asthma and other atopic conditions such as rhinitis, conjunctivitis and eczema. Results: Both case-control and parent-to-siblings analyses demonstrated that while the presence of specific IgE against individual allergens correlated poorly with pathological conditions, particular reactivity profiles were significantly associated with asthma (p<10E-09). An artificial neural network (ANN)-based algorithm, calibrated with the profile reactivity data, correctly classified as asthmatic or non-asthmatic 78% of the individual examined. Multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated that the familiar relationships of the study population did not affect the observed correlations. Conclusions: These findings indicate that asthma is a higher-order phenomenon related to patterns of IgE reactivity rather than to single antibody reactions. This notion sheds new light on the pathogenesis of the disease and can be readily employed to distinguish asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals on the basis of their serum reactivity profile. © 2011 Dottorini et al.",,"allergen; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E; adolescent; adult; aged; article; artificial neural network; asthma; atopy; case control study; child; cohort analysis; conjunctivitis; controlled study; eczema; female; gene sequence; human; immunoglobulin blood level; immunoreactivity; major clinical study; male; nucleotide sequence; preschool child; rhinitis; school child; algorithm; blood; immunoassay; immunology; middle aged; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Allergens; Asthma; Child; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Immunoassay; Immunoglobulin E; Male; Middle Aged","GENBANK: GSE20020","immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Allergens; Immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,"Fanta, C.H., Asthma (2009) N Engl J Med, 360, pp. 1002-1014; Jansson, S.A., Ronmark, E., Forsberg, B., Lofgren, C., Lindberg, A., The economic consequences of asthma among adults in Sweden (2007) Respir Med, 101, pp. 2263-2270; Seaton, A., Godden, D.J., Brown, K., Increase in asthma: A more toxic environment or a more susceptible population?

The disease conditions are recognized by analyzing skin texture images using a set of normalized symmetrical Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM). Directional GLCMs are computed along four directions viz. horizontal, vertical, right diagonal, left diagonal, and a set of features viz. Contrast, Homogeneity, Mean, Variance and Energy computed from each, are averaged to provide an estimation of the texture class. The system is tested on a set of medical images displaying three dermatological skin conditions viz. Acne, Eczema, and Urticaria.

Methods: All reports of alopecia with marketed SSRIs until the end of 2004 were identified in SWEDIS, the national Swedish database for spontaneously reported ADRs, and in Vigibase, the international ADR database of the World Health Organization. Total SSRI sales volumes in Sweden until the end of 2004 were obtained from the National Corporation of Swedish Pharmacies. The Bayes' Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) method was used to estimate associations between alopecia and each of the SSRIs within the two databases. Results: A total of 27 reports of alopecia were identified in SWEDIS. As two reports concerned the use of two SSRIs, there was a total of 29 drug-ADR combinations. All except dime reports concerned women (88.9%). The reporting rate of alopecia in Sweden was significantly higher with sertraline compared with citalopram; 20.1 (95%CI 10.7-34.4) reports per million patient-years versus 4.5 (95%CI 1.8-9.3) reports per million patient-years. No significant differences in reporting rates were noted for the remaining SSRIs. Sertraline also showed a statistically significant association with alopecia in both SWEDIS and Vigibase. Citalopram was significantly associated with alopecia in Vigibase, but not in SWEDIS. No statistically significant associations were found for any of the other SSRIs. Conclusions: Alopecia appears to be a rare ADR to SSRIs. The risk of alopecia seems to vary between the different SSRIs, and might be higher in women than in men.

Therefore, we established special prevention and skin protection courses for HCW. Medical aims are to optimize diagnostic procedures and individual therapy, educational aims are to improve individual skin protection/skin care habits of the patient and also to influence the participants' attitudes towards health. Participants are patients that have been suspected to suffer from an OSD and are insured with the German Accident Prevention Insurance Association for Health Care Workers (BGW). Teaching units mainly focus on the texture and functioning of the skin, general aspects of OSDs, general information concerning skin protection, instructions about the correct use of skin cleansing and skin protection products. Besides, every participant is clinically examined by a dermatologist and a precise patient's history is obtained. Individually adapted skin protection strategies are developed. Patients can ask the dermatologist questions in confidence. 504 patients (mean age: 36.9 years, SD = 11.7) participated in the skin protection courses. 94.6% (n = 477) suffered from hand eczema frequently caused by a mixture of atopic, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis, but irritant contact dermatitis was the most frequent diagnosis (55.4%, n = 279). The participants rated the course as good to excellent. Health education and advisory services in occupational dermatology are still fragmentary. Prevention of OSD and maintenance of health through education are important complementary measures for dermatological care. In the future, similar educational programmes should be offered for employees of other professions with an increased risk for OSD. © 2006 Blackwell Munksgaard.","Atopy; Contact dermatitis; Health education; Occupational skin disease; Secondary prevention","adult; article; atopy; attitude to health; contact dermatitis; education program; female; hand eczema; health care personnel; health education; health insurance; high risk population; human; major clinical study; male; occupational skin disease; risk factor; secondary prevention; skin allergy; skin care; skin function; skin protection; Adult; Decision Trees; Dermatitis, Allergic Contact; Dermatitis, Occupational; Female; Hand Dermatoses; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Education; Questionnaires",,,,,,,,"Diepgen, T.L., Coenraads, P.J., The epidemiology of occupational contact dermatitis (1999) Int Arch Occup Environ Health, 72, pp. 496-506; Dickel, H., Bruckner, T., Bernhard-Klimt, C., Koch, T., Scheidt, R., Diepgen, T.L., Surveillance scheme for occupational skin disease in the Saarland, FRG.

A thorough history, review of systems, and physical examination are critical to determining its cause. Examination of the skin may be misleading. There are frequently only secondary lesions, eczematous changes, lichenification, and excoriation, which may be misdiagnosed as a primary dermatitis. Xerosis may be the cause, but it is sometimes merely coincidental. If primary lesions are present, a skin biopsy can enable a diagnosis to be made. Systemic causes of itch, such as cholestasis, uremia, hyperthyroidism, medications, or lymphoma, must be considered. If cause remains elusive, idiopathic itching of the elderly or so-called ""senile pruritus"" may be considered. However, we propose to discard the term ""senile pruritus"", which can be offensive and frightening. We propose to replace it with ""Willan's itch"". Robert Willan (1757-1812) is honored as one of the founders of modern dermatology thanks to his book, On Cutaneous Diseases, and its morphological approach to skin disease. He was probably the first to give a good clinical description of itching in the elderly. The diagnosis of Willan's itch should be reserved for generalized pruritus in the absence of xerosis or other recognizable cause. The pathophysiology of this form of pruritus is poorly understood, but it is likely that age-related changes of the skin, cutaneous nerves, and other parts of the nervous system play a role. Anecdotal and limited data suggest that gabapentin, cutaneous field stimulation, serotonin antagonists, and ultraviolet B phototherapy may attenuate itch in some of these patients. © 2004 The International Society of Dermatology.",,"acetylsalicylic acid; amiodarone; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antivirus agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; bleomycin; calcium channel blocking agent; capsaicin; cephalosporin derivative; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; doxepin; gabapentin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; isotretinoin; loop diuretic agent; methoxsalen; mirtazapine; nicotinic acid derivative; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; penicillamine; penicillin G; quinidine; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; sulfonylurea derivative; tacrolimus; tamoxifen; thalidomide; thiazide diuretic agent; unindexed drug; vancomycin; aged; cholestasis; dermatitis; diagnostic error; differential diagnosis; dry skin; eczema; human; hyperthyroidism; laboratory diagnosis; lichenoid eruption; pathophysiology; phototherapy; pruritus; review; skin biopsy; skin disease; skin stimulation; ultraviolet B radiation; uremia; Aged; Decision Trees; Humans; Pruritus",,"acetylsalicylic acid, 493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1; amiodarone, 1951-25-3, 19774-82-4, 62067-87-2; bleomycin, 11056-06-7; capsaicin, 404-86-4; doxepin, 1229-29-4, 1668-19-5; gabapentin, 60142-96-3; isotretinoin, 4759-48-2; methoxsalen, 298-81-7, 8004-26-0; mirtazapine, 61337-67-5; penicillamine, 2219-30-9, 52-67-5; penicillin G, 1406-05-9, 61-33-6; quinidine, 56-54-2; tacrolimus, 104987-11-3; tamoxifen, 10540-29-1; thalidomide, 50-35-1; vancomycin, 1404-90-6, 1404-93-9","aspirin",,,,,"Norman, R.A., Xerosis and pruritus in the elderly: Recognition and management (2003) Dermatol.

Clin./Allergol., CHU de Nancy, Hôpital Central, 54035 Nancy Cedex, France","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the first manifestations of the atopic march. The natural history of food allergies (FA) is closely related to AD. Sensitivity to food is demonstrated with cutaneous tests (prick-tests and atopy patch-tests) or the presence of IgE specific to food. A true allergy to a foodstuff is revealed by oral provocation tests (OPT) or by improvement during an avoidance diet. Ingestion of the food allergen during OPT can provoke an onset of eczema, an immediate reaction (urticaria, oedema) or involve other target organs (digestive disorders, rhinitis, asthma or anaphylactic shock). Seven allergens are responsible for around 90 p. 100 of FA: milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts, nuts, soy and fish. The fundamental knowledge acquired demonstrates the implication of food allergens in the physiopathogenesis of AD. The assessment of the efficacy of avoidance diets is difficult to demonstrate in standardised double-blind studies. Their efficacy is demonstrated compared with the natural history of AD. A diagnostic algorythm of FA during AD is proposed. An avoidance diet can be prescribed on 3 levels: primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. Diagnostic dietetics are aimed at initiating a hypoallergenic diet over a short period of 15 to 21 days when AD is severe and does not permit an allergy assessment. This diet is followed by an allergy assessment and OPT to determine the foodstuff responsible. Therapeutic dietetics consists in initiating an avoidance diet based on the results of the allergy assessment: positive predictive value of specific IgE, positivity of oral provocation tests or the re-introduction of the foodstuff for one week. Preventive dietetics is aimed at preventing the onset of AD: a consensus has been established by the American and European Academies of Paediatrics. In conclusion, present knowledge demonstrates that FA is a triggering factor for AD and that the avoidance diets based on allergy assessments are an essential tool in the treatment of AD. Understanding the triggering mechanisms of oral tolerance will permit the development of strategies for the prevention and cure of food allergies.",,"food allergen; immunoglobulin E; algorithm; allergy test; anaphylactic shock; antibody specificity; antibody titer; asthma; atopic dermatitis; clinical feature; conference paper; consensus; diet restriction; dietetics; disease association; eczema; edema; egg; fish; food allergy; gastrointestinal disease; human; milk; nut; outcomes research; patch test; pathophysiology; peanut; prick test; primary prevention; provocation test; secondary prevention; soybean; urticaria; wheat; Child; Decision Trees; Dermatitis, Atopic; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,"Sampson, H.A., The evaluation and management of food allergy in atopic dermatitis (2003) Clinic in Dermatology, 21, pp. 183-192; Johansson, S.G.O., Hourihane, J.O.B., Bousquet, J., Brujinzeel-Koomen, C., Dreborg, S., Haahtela, T., A revised nomenclature for allergy (2001) Allergy, 56, pp. 813-824; Burks, A.W., James, J.M., Hiegel, A., Wilson, G., Wheeler, J.G., Jones, S.M., Atopic dermatitis and food hypersensitivity reactions (1988) J Pediatr, 132, pp. 132-136; Hill, D.J., Sporik, R., Thorburn, J., Hosking, C.S., The association of atopic dermatitis in infancy with immunoglobulin E food sensitization (2000) J Pediatr, 137, pp. 475-479; Böhme, M., Svensson, A., Kull, I., Nordvall, S.L., Wahlgren, C.F., Clinical features of atopic dermatitis at two years of age: A prospective, population-based case-control study (2001) Acta Derm Venereol, 81, pp. 193-197; Custafsson, D., Sjöberg, O., Foucard, T., Sensitization to food and airborne allergens in children with atopic dermatitis followed up to 7 years of age (2003) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 14, pp. 448-452; Cantani, A., Micera, M., Epidemiology of atopy in 220 children: Diagnostic reliability of skin prick-tests and total and specific IgE levels (2003) Minerva Pediatr, 55, pp. 129-142; Wolkerstorfer, A., Wahn, U., Kjellman, N.I.M., Diepgens, T., De Longueville, M., Oranje, A., Natural course of sensitization to cow's milk and hen's egg in childhood atopic dermatitis: ETAC study group (2002) Clin Exp Allergy, 32, pp. 70-73; Schoetzau, A., Filipiak-Pittroff, B., Franke, K., Koletzko, S., Von Berg, A., Gruebl, A., Effect of exclusive breast-feeding and early solid food avoidance on the incidence of atopic dermatitis in high-risk infants at 1 year of age (2002) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 13, pp. 234-242; Moneret-Vautrin, D.A., Kanny, G., Guérin, L., Flabbee, J., Lemerdy, P., Le syndrome des allergies alimentaires multiples (2000) Allergie Immunol, 32, pp. 12-15; Illi, S., Von Mutius, E., Lau, S., Nickel, R., Grüber, C., Niggemann, B., The natural course of atopic dermatitis from birth to age of 7 years and the association with asthma (2004) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 113, pp. 925-931; De Maat-Bleeker, F., Bruinzeel-Koomen, C.A., Food allergy indults with atopic dermatitis (1996) Monogr Allergy Highlights in Food Allergy, 32, pp. 157-164. , Wüthrich B, Ortolani C (eds).

METHODS: A final diagnosis of asthma can be made only after full clinical assessment but limited resources make it impossible to offer this to complete populations as part of a screening programme. Prioritisation is required so that review can be offered most promptly to those most in need. A stratified random sample of 180 from 6825 respondents to a community survey underwent clinical review. They were categorised according to likelihood of asthma by three independent experts whose opinions were combined into a single probability label for each patient. A neural network was trained to relate questionnaire responses to probability labels. The trained network was applied to the whole community to produce a ranking order based on likelihood of asthma. A screening threshold could then be set to correspond to available resources, and patients above this level with no recorded evidence of asthma diagnosis could be assessed clinically. Using the known probability labels from the training set, it was possible to derive the expected proportion of true asthmatics in any set of patients. RESULTS: If the screening threshold had been set to capture the top 10% of the ranked population (n = 683), then 239 patients above this threshold had no evidence of diagnosis and would need assessment. Of these, it would be expected that 74% would have the diagnosis confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: This approach allows prioritisation of a population where resources for diagnostic examination are limited.
