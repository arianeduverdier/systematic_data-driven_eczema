Objectives: To investigate risk factors for AD burden in the first 3 years of life. Methods: The Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2010 included 700 children. AD burden was assessed by daily diary entries with information on AD and steroid days measuring 18 possible heritable, prenatal, and postnatal environmental exposures. Results: The children with AD had a median (interquartile range) of 136 symptom days (61-294 days) and 72 steroid days (27-145 days) during the first 3 years of life, with the highest disease burden in the second year of life. The multivariable risk factor analysis showed that maternal AD and childhood allergic sensitization were associated with a higher number of AD days and maternal AD, filaggrin mutation, and allergic sensitization were associated with a higher number of steroid days. Limitations: Participants with a personal interest in atopic diseases could be more likely to participate. Conclusion: Children's burden of AD, assessed quantitatively as AD and steroid days, demonstrated positive associations with maternal AD, filaggrin mutation, and early-life allergic sensitization, with the highest disease burden in the second year of life. © 2020 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.","atopic dermatitis; burden of disease; corticosteroids; eczema severity; filaggrin; pediatrics","filaggrin; hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone butyrate; steroid; adult; allergic rhinitis; allergy; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; childhood; cohort analysis; data analysis software; disease burden; disease severity; eczema; environmental exposure; environmental factor; family history; female; gene mutation; heritability; human; infant; major clinical study; male; maternal disease; newborn; perinatal period; prenatal exposure; priority journal; risk factor; sensitization; steroid therapy; symptom; topical treatment",,"hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; hydrocortisone butyrate, 13609-67-1",,,"Natur og Univers, Det Frie Forskningsråd, FNU, DFF

It is characterized into acute phase, which is dominated by T helper 2-type immune responses, and chronic phase, which is dominated by T helper 1-type immune responses. Studies have shown that 3,3′-diindolylmethane not only has antitumor effects but also can relieve symptoms of inflammatory diseases by inhibiting the nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway and regulating T cell differentiation. To study the effect of 3,3′-diindolylmethane on atopic dermatitis and the underlying mechanism, a mouse model of acute atopic dermatitis was established using 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene. After intraperitoneal injection of 3,3′-diindolylmethane, skin erythema and edema in mice were significantly alleviated. Furthermore, 3,3′-diindolylmethane reduced immune activation, probably by inhibiting the secretion of thymic stromal lymphopoietin by keratinocytes. 3,3′-Diindolylmethane also promoted the differentiation of regulatory T cells and inhibited the activation of T helper 2 and T helper 17 cells to reduce atopic dermatitis-related immune responses. However, it showed no significant effect on the differentiation of T helper 1 cells. These results indicate that 3,3′-diindolylmethane has a significant inhibitory effect on T helper 2 cells in the acute phase of atopic dermatitis. Our findings may provide not only more insights into the pathological mechanism of AD, but also a new candidate medicine for it. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","3,3'-Diindolylmethane; Atopic dermatitis; Regulatory T cell; T-helper cell; Thymic stromal lymphopoietin","1 fluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene; 3,3' diindolylmethane; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; atopic dermatitis; controlled study; drug effect; erythema; female; human; human cell; immune response; keratinocyte; lymphocyte differentiation; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; skin edema; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; Th2 cell",,"1 fluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene, 25376-51-6, 70-34-8; 3,3' diindolylmethane, 1968-05-4",,"TCI, Japan","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 81673380, 81973273

We aimed to use high-throughput sequencing to characterize the differences in the composition of the gut microbiota between healthy controls and patients with AD. Fecal samples from 93 volunteers were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing, including 44 patients with AD and 49 healthy control subjects, aged 6–22 years. Our data show that the operational taxonomic unit composition in patients with AD had greater component similarity than the healthy controls. Patients with AD had a lower alpha diversity than healthy control subjects. The relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae, Blautia, Parabacteroides, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides uniformis and Prevotella stercorea was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in patients with AD than healthy control subjects. Clostridium and P. stercorea were higher (P < 0.05) in healthy control subjects compared with patients with AD. The results of linear discriminant analysis effect size show that Bacteroidaceae and Porphyromonadaceae can act as possible biomarkers associated with diagnosis of AD. However, this needs further experimental verification. Taken together, these results demonstrate the changes in microbiota composition in AD compared with a healthy control group, opening the way to future diagnosis or intervention studies. © 2020 Japanese Dermatological Association","16S rRNA; atopic dermatitis; dominant bacteria; gut microbiota; species composition","RNA 16S; adolescent; adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; Bacteroidaceae; Bacteroides ovatus; Bacteroides uniformis; Blautia; child; Chinese; clinical article; Clostridium; controlled study; discriminant analysis; disease marker; effect size; feces analysis; female; high throughput sequencing; human; intestine flora; male; microbial community; Parabacteroides; population abundance; Porphyromonadaceae; preschool child; Prevotella; Prevotella stercorea; RNA sequencing; school child; species diversity; taxonomy; volunteer; young adult",,,,,"2018B030322012, MB2020KF04

However, population-level disease incidence patterns do not necessarily reflect the development of allergic disease in individuals. A better understanding of the factors that predispose to different allergic trajectories is needed. Objective: Our aim was to determine the demographic and genetic features that are associated with the major allergic march trajectories. Methods: Presence or absence of common allergic conditions (atopic dermatitis [AD], IgE-mediated food allergy [IgE-FA], asthma, and allergic rhinitis [AR]) was ascertained in a pediatric primary care birth cohort of 158,510 subjects. Hierarchic clustering and decision tree modeling were used to associate demographic features with allergic outcomes. Genome-wide association study was used to test for risk loci associated with specific allergic trajectories. Results: We found an association between self-identified black race and progression from AD to asthma. Conversely, Asian or Pacific Islander race was associated with progression from AD to IgE-mediated food allergy, and white race was associated with progression from AD to AR. Genome-wide association study of trajectory groups identified risk loci associated with progression from AD to asthma (rs60242841) and from AD to AR (rs9565267, rs151041509, and rs78171803). Consistent with our epidemiologic associations, rs60242841 was more common in individuals of African ancestry than in individuals of European ancestry, whereas rs9565267 and rs151041509 were more common in individuals of European ancestry than in individuals of African ancestry. Conclusion: We have identified novel associations between race and progression along distinct allergic trajectories. Ancestral genetic differences may contribute to these associations. These results uncover important health disparities, refine the concept of the allergic march, and represent a step toward developing individualized medical approaches for these conditions. © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","allergic march; allergic rhinitis; allergic trajectory; asthma; atopic dermatitis; Atopic march; epidemiology; genome-wide association study; IgE-mediated food allergy",,,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: AI116794, DK116668, LM010098, LM012601

Stratification of patients into biomarker-based endotypes is important for future development of personalized therapies. Objective: Our aim was to confirm previously defined serum biomarker-based patient clusters in a new cohort of patients with AD. Methods: A panel of 143 biomarkers was measured by using Luminex technology in serum samples from 146 patients with severe AD (median Eczema Area and Severity Index = 28.3; interquartile range = 25.2-35.3). Principal components analysis followed by unsupervised k-means cluster analysis of the biomarker data was used to identify patient clusters. A prediction model was built on the basis of a previous cohort to predict the 1 of the 4 previously identified clusters to which the patients of our new cohort would belong. Results: Cluster analysis identified 4 serum biomarker–based clusters, 3 of which (clusters B, C, and D) were comparable to the previously identified clusters. Cluster A (33.6%) could be distinguished from the other clusters as being a “skin-homing chemokines/IL-1R1–dominant” cluster, whereas cluster B (18.5%) was a “TH1/TH2/TH17-dominant” cluster, cluster C (18.5%) was a “TH2/TH22/PARC-dominant” cluster, and cluster D (29.5%) was a “TH2/eosinophil-inferior” cluster. Additionally, by using a prediction model based on our previous cohort we accurately assigned the new cohort to the 4 previously identified clusters by including only 10 selected serum biomarkers. Conclusion: We confirmed that AD is heterogeneous at the immunopathologic level and identified 4 distinct biomarker-based clusters, 3 of which were comparable with previously identified clusters. Cluster membership could be predicted with a model including 10 serum biomarkers. © 2020 The Authors","Atopic dermatitis; biomarkers; clusters; endotypes; personalized medicine; prediction; principal components analysis","azathioprine; biological marker; C-C motif chemokine 18; corticosteroid; cutaneous T cell attracting chemokine; cyclosporine; eotaxin; epidermal growth factor; gamma interferon; interleukin 1; interleukin 1 receptor type I; interleukin 13; interleukin 17; interleukin 21; interleukin 22; interleukin 25; interleukin 26; interleukin 33; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; lymphotoxin; macrophage derived chemokine; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; mycophenolic acid; RANTES; tacrolimus; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; tumor necrosis factor; adult; allergic asthma; allergic rhinitis; Article; atopic dermatitis; atopy; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; Eczema Area and Severity Index; electronic medical record; female; food allergy; human; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal",,"azathioprine, 446-86-6; cyclosporine, 59865-13-3, 63798-73-2, 79217-60-0; epidermal growth factor, 59459-45-9, 62229-50-9; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; interleukin 21, 251100-02-4, 510787-82-3, 542817-56-1; interleukin 22, 457106-70-6, 478219-35-1, 554460-75-2; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5, 7532-09-4, 6745-93-3; mycophenolate mofetil, 116680-01-4, 128794-94-5; mycophenolic acid, 23047-11-2, 24280-93-1; tacrolimus, 104987-11-3; thymus and activation regulated chemokine, 181532-29-6",,,,"Research was funded by Regeneron and Sanofi Genzyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,,,"Werfel, T., Allam, J.P., Biedermann, T., Eyerich, K., Gilles, S., Guttman-Yassky, E., Cellular and molecular immunologic mechanisms in patients with atopic dermatitis (2016) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 138, pp. 336-349; Bieber, T., D'Erme, A.M., Akdis, C.A., Traidl-Hoffmann, C., Lauener, R., Schappi, G., Clinical phenotypes and endophenotypes of atopic dermatitis: where are we, and where should we go?

A clear differentiation of the clinical phenotypes can provide better asthma management and prediction of asthma prognosis. Little is currently known about asthma phenotypes in Korean children. This study was designed to identify asthma phenotypes in school-aged Korean children. Methods: This study enrolled 674 children with physician-diagnosed asthma from the Korean childhood Asthma Study (KAS) cohort. The physicians verified the relevant histories of asthma and comorbid diseases, as well as airway lability and hyper-responsiveness from the results of pulmonary function tests and bronchial provocation tests. Questionnaires regarding the participants' baseline characteristics, their environment and self-rating of asthma control were collected at the time of enrollment. Laboratory tests were performed to assess allergy and airway inflammation. Children with asthma were classified by hierarchical cluster analysis. Results: Of the 674 patients enrolled from the KAS cohort, 447 were included in the cluster analysis. Cluster analysis of these 447 children revealed 4 asthma phenotypes: cluster 1 (n = 216, 48.3%) which was characterized by male-dominant atopic asthma; cluster 2 (n = 79, 17.7%) which was characterized by early-onset atopic asthma with atopic dermatitis; cluster 3 (n = 47, 10.5%) which was characterized by puberty-onset, female-dominant atopic asthma with the low lung function; and cluster 4 (n = 105, 23.5%) which was characterized by early-onset, non-atopic dominant asthma. Conclusions: The asthma phenotypes among Korean children can be classified into 4 distinct clusters. Long-term follow-up with these phenotypes will be needed to define their prognosis and response to treatment.

However, its biological diversity has not been well-characterized in Chinese psoriasis population. Objectives: To characterize psoriasis biological heterogenicity using gene expression profiles of lesional skin biopsy specimens in a Chinese psoriasis population. Methods: Lesional tissues and blood samples from Chinese psoriasis patients (n = 40), atopic dermatitis (AD) patients (n = 25) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 19) were investigated by using real-time PCR array, histological evaluation and flow cytometry. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using gene expression profiles of patients with psoriasis. Results: Two distinct psoriasis clusters were identified. Both clusters indicated high TH17 activation. One cluster (n = 6 of 40 consecutive psoriasis patients) indicated a strong TH2 component in skin lesions, with early onset and low peripheral blood eosinophil level. Significantly higher IL-4, IL-13, IL-25, IL-31 and TSLP gene induction typified this cluster of psoriasis patients, even compared with AD patients. Both psoriasis clusters were characterized by neutrophilic microabscess formation. Histologically, the TH2 high psoriasis cluster indicated a low percentage of perivascular eosinophils. Conclusions: Two distinct psoriasis clusters were identified. One presented early onset and a low eosinophil level, indicating TH17 polarization and a strong TH2 component. These results laid the foundation for further demonstrating the pathogenesis of psoriasis in Chinese population. © 2020 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",,"alpha1 interferon; chemokine receptor CCR7;

This article covers the basic concepts of cost-utility analyses and reviews the available literature on cost utility of biologic drugs in atopic disorders. When used within their limits as part of a multi-dimensional assessment, economic analyses can be extremely useful to guide decision-making and prioritization of care. Despite the good quality of most cost-utility analyses conducted for the use of biologics in asthma and other atopic diseases, their conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness are extremely variable. This is mainly due to the use of inconsistent estimates of health utility benefit with therapy. Development of reliable and validated instruments to measure disutility in atopic disorders and measure of indirect costs in atopic disease are identified as a priority for future research. © 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

We studied whether familial clustering of BPS, other autoimmune diseases or fibromyalgia exist among BPS patients’ genetically close relatives; possibly reflecting some common predisposing genetic background of these diseases. Materials and methods: Altogether 420 first- or second-degree relatives of 94 BPS patients fulfilling the NIDDK criteria were asked to fill in a survey on the self-reported diagnosis of urinary tract diseases, fibromyalgia and 23 autoimmune diseases, together with filling the O’Leary–Sant symptom score. The ones with high symptom scores were interviewed and, if necessary, referred to a further clinical consultation. The prevalence of other diseases was compared to previously published prevalence percentages. Results: 334 (80%) of 420 family members returned the questionnaire. Only one of the relatives fulfilled the NIDDK criteria, and one sibling pair among the original BPS patients was found. Asthma, ulcerative colitis, fibromyalgia, iritis and rheumatoid arthritis were more common in the study population than in the reference populations. The reported prevalence of atopic dermatitis and rhinoconjunctivitis causing allergies were lower. In addition, the results show that the O’Leary–Sant symptom score is not reliable in screening for new BPS cases. Conclusions: Our study suggests that in BPS patients’ families, fibromyalgia and autoimmune diseases including asthma, and especially the non-allergic form of asthma, may be over-represented. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, there is paucity of data on the use of live lactobacilli to control axillary malodor. The objective of this study was to determine whether application of topical oil-based cream containing live Lactobacilli could decrease malodor-producing bacteria in the axilla of healthy subjects. Aims: To determine the effects of topical cream with live lactobacilli on malodor-producing bacteria in the axilla of healthy subjects. Patients/Methods: Twenty-five adult volunteers comprising 12 males and 13 females provided informed consent. Axillary skin swabs were collected before and after 14 days application of topical cream containing live Lactobacillus pentosus KCA1. Bacterial DNA was extracted, and V4 region of the 16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced in a pair-end configuration on the Illumina MiSeq platform rendering 2 × 150 bp sequences. Microbial taxonomy to species level was generated using the Greengenes database. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) was used to identify biologically and statistically significant differences in relative abundance. Results: Actinobacteria decreased from 70% to 24%, and Firmicutes increased from 26.6% to 73.9% among the female participants. In males, Actinobacteria decreased from 65% to 38%, while Firmicutes increased from 24% to 57%. Corynebacterium decreased from 62.91% to 36.63%, while Lactobacillus increased from 0.06% to 23.11%. In males, unliked females, there were reduction of Staphylococcus species associated with malodor, notably Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus hemolyticus, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Bacterial functional gene- Pyridoxal protein dependent enzymes involved in biotransformation of malodor precursor to volatile thioalcohols were down-regulated. Conclusions: Application of Lactobacillus pentosus KCA1 cream led to a significant decrease in the relative abundance of odor-producing Corynebacterium species in both female and male subjects. Some species associated with malodor especially Corynebacterium striatum, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, and Staphylococcus hominis decreased by 96%, 73%, 7%, and 20.8%, respectively, in males. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","axilla; lactobacilli; malodor; microbiota; probiotics; topical cream",,,,,,,,,,,"Urban, J., Fergus, D.J., Savage, A.M., The effect of habitual and experimental antiperspirant and deodorant product use on the armpit microbiome (2016) PeerJ, 4; Bawdon, D., Cox, D.S., Ashford, D., James, A.G., Thomas, G.H., Identification of axillary Staphylococcus sp. involved in the production of the malodorous thioalcohol 3-methyl-3-sufanylhexan-1-ol (2015) FEMS Microbiol Lett, 362, p. fnv111; Rudden, M., Herman, R., Rose, M., The molecular basis of thioalcohol production in human body odour (2020) Sci Rep, 10, p. 12500; Grice, E.A., Kong, H.H., Renaud, G., Topographical and temporal diversity of the human skin microbiome (2009) Science, 324, pp. 1190-1192; Troccaz, M., Gaïa, N., Beccucci, S., Mapping axillary microbiota responsible for body odours using a culture-independent approach (2015) Microbiome, 3, p. 3; Egert, M., Schmidt, I., Höhne, H.-M., Lachnit, T., Schmitz, R.A., Breves, R., rRNA-based profiling of bacteria in the axilla of healthy males suggests right–left asymmetry in bacterial activity (2011) FEMS Microbiol Ecol, 77, pp. 146-153; Anukam, K.C., Mmewurum, V., Agbakoba, N.R., Axillary Microbiota Compositions from Men and Women in a Tertiary Institution-South East Nigeria: Effects of Deodorants/Antiperspirants on Bacterial Communities (2020) BioRxiv, , https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.986364; Natsch, A., Schmid, J., Flachsmann, F., Identification of odoriferous sulfanylalkanols in human axilla secretions and their formation through cleavage of cysteine precursors by a C-S lyase isolated from axilla bacteria (2004) Chem Biodivers, 1 (7), pp. 1058-1072; Anukam, K.C., Macklaim, J.M., Gloor, G.B., Genome Sequence of Lactobacillus pentosus KCA1: Vaginal Isolate from a Healthy Premenopausal Woman (2013) PLoS One, 8 (3); Oerlemans, E.F.M., Bellen, G., Claes, I., Impact of a lactobacilli-containing gel on vulvovaginal candidosis and the vaginal microbiome (2020) Sci Rep, 10, p. 7976; Anukam, K.C., Reid, G., Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum with Pobiotic Potentials Isolated from the Vagina of Healthy Nigerian Women (2007) Res J Microbiol, 2 (1), pp. 81-87; Lebeer, S., Oerlemans, E., Claes, I., Wuyts, S., Henkens, T., Topical cream with live lactobacilli modulates the skin microbiome and reduce acne symptoms, , https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/463307v1, 2019; Caporaso, J.G., Lauber, C.L., Walters, W.A., Global patterns of 16S rRNA diversity at a depth of millions of sequences per sample (2011) Proc Nat Aca Sci USA, 108 (1), pp. 4516-4522; Gomez-Alvarez, V., Teal, T., Schmidt, T., Systematic artifacts in metagenomes from complex microbial communities (2009) ISME J, 3, pp. 1314-1317; Langmead, B., Trapnell, C., Pop, M., Salzberg, S.L., Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome (2009) Genome Biol, 10, p.

Objective: This study was conducted to identify patterns of farm exposure in Wisconsin family farms that modify AD incidence and prevalence in early childhood. Methods: Environmental exposures, health history, and clinical outcomes were prospectively recorded for 111 farm families and 129 non–farm families enrolled in the Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort birth cohort study. Exposures from the prenatal and early postnatal (2-month) visits were evaluated together with parental report of AD diagnosis by a health care provider through age 24 months. Latent class analysis was performed with prenatal and early postnatal farm-exposure variables to assign farm children to 3 classes. Results: Overall, children of farm families had reduced AD incidence (P =.03). Within farm families, exposures including poultry (3% vs 28%; P =.003), pig (4% vs 25%; P =.04), feed grain (13% vs 34%; P =.02), and number of animal species were inversely associated with AD incidence. Among the latent class groups, children in families with diverse or more intense farm exposures (classes A and B) had reduced AD incidence, whereas low-exposure (class C) infants had AD incidence similar to that in nonfarm children. Conclusions: Infants in Wisconsin farm families had reduced AD incidence, and patterns of farm exposures further defined AD risk. These findings suggest that exposure to diverse farm animals, feed, and bedding during the prenatal period and in early infancy reduce the risk of early-onset AD, a phenotype associated with multiple other atopic diseases. © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Atopic dermatitis; birth cohort; children; farm effect; latent class analysis",,,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

Metabolomics has the potential to identify disease endotypes, which could beneficially promote personalized prevention and treatment. Here, we summarize the findings from metabolomics studies of children with atopic diseases focusing on tyrosine and tryptophan metabolism, lipids (particularly, sphingolipids), polyunsaturated fatty acids, microbially derived metabolites (particularly, shortchain fatty acids), and bile acids. We included 25 studies: 23 examined asthma or wheezing, five examined allergy endpoints, and two focused on atopic dermatitis. Of the 25 studies, 20 reported findings in the pathways of interest with findings for asthma in all pathways and for allergy and atopic dermatitis in most pathways except tyrosine metabolism and short-chain fatty acids, respectively. Particularly, tyrosine, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, N-acetyltyrosine, tryptophan, indolelactic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, p-Cresol sulfate, taurocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, glycohyocholic acid, glycocholic acid, and docosapentaenoate n-6 were identified in at least two studies. This pathway-specific review provides a comprehensive overview of the existing evidence from metabolomics studies of childhood atopic diseases. The altered metabolic pathways uncover some of the underlying biochemical mechanisms leading to these common childhood disorders, which may become of potential value in clinical practice. © 2020 by the authors.

Objective: Skin biomarkers are needed for skin barrier interventions studies. Methods: In this study, skin tape strip (STS) samples were collected from nonlesional skin of 62 children in AD FA+, AD FA−, and nonatopic groups for mass spectrometry proteomic analysis. transepidermal water loss and allergic sensitization were assessed. STS proteomic analysis results were validated in an independent cohort of 41 adults with AD with and without FA versus nonatopic controls. Results: A group of 45 proteins was identified as a principal component 1 (PC1) with the highest expression in AD FA+ STSs. This novel set of STS proteins was highly correlative to skin transepidermal water loss and allergic sensitization. PC1 proteins included keratin intermediate filaments; proteins associated with inflammatory responses (S100 proteins, alarmins, protease inhibitors); and glycolysis and antioxidant defense enzymes. Analysis of PC1 proteins expression in an independent adult AD cohort validated differential expression of STS PC1 proteins in the skin of adult patients with AD with the history of clinical reactions to peanut. Conclusions: STS analysis of nonlesional skin of AD children identified a cluster of proteins with the highest expression in AD FA+ children. The differential expression of STS PC1 proteins was confirmed in a replicate cohort of adult AD patients with FA to peanut, suggesting a unique STS proteomic endotype for AD FA+ that persists into adulthood. Collectively, PC1 proteins are associated with abnormalities in skin barrier integrity and may increase the risk of epicutaneous sensitization to food allergens. © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Atopic dermatitis; food allergy; IgE; proteomics; skin barrier; transepidermal water loss",,,,,,"UL1 TR-002535

Research results in animal infection models support the concept that superantigens, including SEB contribute to sepsis and skin and soft tissue infections. In contrast to antibiotics, antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI) is a promising method to combat both bacterial cells and virulence factors. The main aims of this research were to (1) select the most stable reference genes under sublethal aPDI treatments and (2) evaluate the impact of aPDI on seb. Two aPDI combinations were applied under sublethal conditions: rose bengal (RB) and green light (λmax = 515 nm) and new methylene blue (NMB) and red light (λmax = 632 nm). The stability of ten candidate reference genes (16S rRNA, fabD, ftsZ, gmk, gyrB, proC, pyk, rho, rpoB and tpiA) was evaluated upon aPDI using four software packages—BestKeeper, geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder. Statistical analyses ranked ftsZ and gmk (RB + green light) and ftsZ, proC, and fabD (NMB + red light) as the most stable reference genes upon photodynamic treatment. Our studies showed downregulation of seb under both aPDI conditions, suggesting that aPDI could decrease the level of virulence factors. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"enterotoxin; enterotoxin B, staphylococcal; virulence factor; essential gene; gene expression regulation; genetics; Staphylococcus aureus; Enterotoxins; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Essential; Staphylococcus aureus; Virulence Factors",,"enterotoxin B, staphylococcal; Enterotoxins; Virulence Factors",,,"BW 538-M036-B038-18

Objective: To characterize the triggers of itch in adult AD. Methods: This was a prospective dermatology practice–based study using questionnaires and evaluation by a dermatologist (n = 587). Thirteen itch triggers were assessed using the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system Itch-Triggers. Results: Overall, 381 (64.9%) patients reported greater than or equal to 1 itch trigger in the past week and 212 (36.1%) reported greater than or equal to 3 itch triggers. The most commonly reported triggers were stress (35.4%), sweat (30.5%), weather change (24.7%), dry air (24.4%), and heat (24.0%). In multivariable Poisson regression models, the number of itch triggers was associated with more severe patient-reported global AD severity, Numeric Rating Scale worst itch, Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, Scoring Atopic Dermatitis sleep, Numeric Rating Scale skin pain, Eczema Area and Severity Index, and objective Scoring Atopic Dermatitis. The seasonality of AD was associated with distinct itch triggers. In multivariable logistic regression models, the number of itch triggers was associated with less than or equal to 3 months of AD remission during the year, greater than or equal to 2 AD flares, and AD being worse during some seasons. Four patterns of itch triggers were identified using latent class analysis, each associated with different clinical characteristics. Conclusion: Itch triggers are common and affect the course of AD. Itch triggers are an important end point to assess in patients with AD. © 2020 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",,"antihistaminic agent; corticosteroid; cyclosporine; dupilumab; emollient agent; gabapentin; methotrexate; mycophenolic acid; adult; aged; Article; atopic dermatitis; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dermatologist; dermatology; disease association; disease course; disease exacerbation; disease severity; eczema; Eczema Area and Severity Index; female; heat; human; human tissue; life stress; major clinical study; male; medical examination; medical practice; numeric rating scale; outcome assessment; Patient Oriented Eczema Measure; patient-reported outcome; phototherapy; priority journal; prospective study; pruritus; questionnaire; remission; risk factor; Scoring Atopic Dermatitis; scoring system; seasonal variation; skin pain; sweat; very elderly; weather; atopic dermatitis; latent class analysis; middle aged; pathophysiology; pruritus; season; severity of illness index; statistical model; symptom assessment; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Latent Class Analysis; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Prospective Studies; Pruritus; Seasons; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Symptom Assessment",,"cyclosporine, 59865-13-3, 63798-73-2, 79217-60-0; dupilumab, 1190264-60-8; gabapentin, 60142-96-3; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; mycophenolic acid, 23047-11-2, 24280-93-1",,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ: K12 HS023011

However, little is known about the role of IL-22 in the pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We aimed to investigate the expression of IL-22 and its pathogenic function in type 2 immune reactions of nasal polyps (NP). Methods: Protein levels of inflammatory mediators were determined by multiplex immunoassay, and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Immunofluorescence analysis and mast cell culture were used to determine the cellular sources of IL-22. Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were stimulated using IL-22 in combination with diverse cytokines, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) was measured. Results: IL-22 expression was not up-regulated in NP compared with control tissues, but IL-22-high NP revealed distinct features characterized by type 2 inflammatory cytokines such as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)-11, CCL-24, and IL-5 on the PCA. Additionally, IL-22 positively correlated with type 2 immune mediators and the disease severity in NP. For the localization of the cellular sources of IL-22 in eosinophilic NP, it was expressed in cells mostly composed of eosinophil peroxidase-positive cells and partially of tryptase-positive cells. The human mast cell line, LAD2 cells, released IL-22 mediated by immunoglobulin E. Moreover, IL-22 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL-22Ra1) expression was significantly increased in NP. IL-22Ra1 was up-regulated with poly(I:C) stimulation in NHBE cells. Furthermore, TSLP production was enhanced when stimulated with a combination of IL-13, poly(I:C), and IL-22. Treatment with anti-IL-22Ra1 also inhibited IL-22-induced enhancement of TSLP production. Conclusion: IL-22 was associated with type 2 inflammatory reactions in NP. The IL-22/IL-22Ra1 axis was enhanced and might be involved in type 2 inflammatory reactions via TSLP production in NP.

The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) is not yet fully understood, but the bacterial composition of AD patients' skin has been shown to have an increased abundance of Staphylococcus aureus. More recently, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) species were shown to be able to inhibit S. aureus, but further studies are required to determine the effects of Staphylococcus community variation in AD. Aim. Here we investigated whether analysing metabarcoding data with the more recently developed DADA2 approach improves metabarcoding analyses compared to the previously used operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering, and can be used to study Staphylococcus community dynamics. Methods. The bacterial 16S rRNA region from tape strip samples of the stratum corneum of AD patients (non-lesional skin) and non-AD controls was metabarcoded. We processed metabarcoding data with two different bioinformatic pipelines (an OTU clustering method and DADA2), which were analysed with and without technical replication (sampling strategy). Results. We found that OTU clustering and DADA2 performed well for community-level studies, as demonstrated by the identification of significant differences in the skin bacterial communities associated with AD. However, the OTU clustering approach inflated bacterial richness, which was worsened by not having technical replication. Data processed with DADA2 likely handled sequencing errors more effectively and thereby did not inflate molecular richness. Conclusion. We believe that DADA2 represents an improvement over an OTU clustering approach, and that biological replication rather than technical replication is a more effective use of resources. However, neither OTU clustering nor DADA2 gave insights into Staphylococcus community dynamics, and caution should remain in not overinterpreting the taxonomic assignments at lower taxonomic ranks. © 2020 The Authors This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License.","Atopic dermatitis; DADA2; Eczema; Metabarcoding; OTU clustering; Skin microbiome; Staphylococcus aureus","RNA 16S; adult; aged; atopic dermatitis; biology; classification; cluster analysis; comparative study; DNA barcoding; female; genetics; human; male; microbiology; microflora; middle aged; skin; Staphylococcus aureus; young adult; Adult; Aged; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Dermatitis, Atopic; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; Female; Humans; Male; Microbiota; Middle Aged; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Skin; Staphylococcus aureus; Young Adult",,"RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",,,"Statens Serum Institut, SSI

Objective: To develop a convolutional neural network model to classify clinically relevant selected multiple-lesion skin diseases, this in accordance to the STARD guidelines. Methods: This was an image-based retrospective study using multi-task learning for binary classification. A VGG-16 model was trained on 16,543 non-standardized images. Image data was distributed in training set (80%), validation set (10%), and test set (10%). All images were collected from a clinical database of a Danish population attending one dermatological department. Included was patients categorized with ICD-10 codes related to acne, rosacea, psoriasis, eczema, and cutaneous t-cell lymphoma. Results: Acne was distinguished from rosacea with a sensitivity of 85.42% CI 72.24–93.93% and a specificity of 89.53% CI 83.97–93.68%, cutaneous t-cell lymphoma was distinguished from eczema with a sensitivity of 74.29% CI 67.82–80.05% and a specificity of 84.09% CI 80.83–86.99%, and psoriasis from eczema with a sensitivity of 81.79% CI 78.51–84.76% and a specificity of 73.57% CI 69.76–77.13%. All results were based on the test set.

Methods: The algorithm was developed using data from 1232 patients from four countries participating in the National Health and Wellness Study. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the conceptual overlap between DLQI and EQ-5D-5L. Six mapping models (ordinary least squares [OLS], Tobit, three different two-part models, and a regression mixture model) were tested with different specifications to determine model performance and were ranked based on the sum of mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). Results: The mean DLQI score was 7.23; mean EQ-5D-5L score was 0.78; and there were moderate negative correlations between DLQI and EQ-5D-5L scores (p = − 0.514). A regression mixture model with total DLQI, and age and sex as independent variables performed best for mapping DLQI to EQ-5D-5L (RMSE = 0.113; MAE = 0.079). Conclusion: This was the first study to map DLQI to EQ-5D-5L exclusively in patients with AD. The regression mixture model with total DLQI, and age and sex as independent variables was the best performing model and accurately predicted EQ-5D-5L. The results of this mapping can be used to translate DLQI data from clinical studies to health state utility values in economic evaluations. © 2020, The Author(s).","Atopic Dermatitis (AD); Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI); EuroQoL-5-dimension (EQ-5D); Mapping","adult; age; algorithm; Article; atopic dermatitis; Dermatology Life Quality Index; economic evaluation; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; female; health status; human; independent variable; major clinical study; male; priority journal; sex; atopic dermatitis; middle aged; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,"LEO Pharma Research Foundation","This study was sponsored by Leo Pharma.",,,,"Barbarot, S., Auziere, S., Gadkari, A., Girolomoni, G., Puig, L., Simpson, E., Epidemiology of atopic dermatitis in adults: Results from an international survey (2018) Allergy, 73 (6), pp. 1284-1293; Weidinger, S., Novak, N., Atopic dermatitis (2016) Lancet, 387, pp. 1109-1122. , PID: 26377142; (2018) A Misunderstood Skin Disease: Mapping the Policy Response to Atopic Dermatitis, , https://eiuperspectives.economist.com/sites/default/files/A%20misunderstood%20skin%20disease_Mapping%20the%20policy%20response%20to%20atopic%20dermatitis.pdf, Retrieved July 3, 2019 from; Chalmers, J., Thomas, K., Apfelbacher, C., Williams, H., Prinsen, C., Spuls, P., Report from the fifth international consensus meeting to harmonize core outcome measures for atopic eczema/dermatitis clinical trials (HOME initiative) (2018) BJD, 178, pp. e332-e2341. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BC1MjksVCgtQ%3D%3D; (2019) Position Statement on Use of the EQ-5D-5L Value Set for England, , https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/our-programmes/nice-guidance/technology-appraisal-guidance/eq-5d-5l, (updated October 2019).

Objectives: This study aimed to propose clusters of family management styles in the Korean families of children with chronic atopic disease, including allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, and/or allergic rhinitis and examine the level of family functioning according to these clusters. Design: Cross-sectional study. Settings: A university-level hospital in metropolitan Seoul, South Korea. Participants: Parents of children with chronic atopic disease. Methods: This study included 146 participants. The Korean version of the Family Management Measure and the Korean Family Functioning Scale were used to assess family management styles and family functioning, respectively. Data were analyzed using SPSS 24.0 using descriptive statistics, agglomerative hierarchical clustering with Ward's method prior to k-means clustering, k-means clustering analysis, analysis of variance, and chi-squared test. Results: Four clusters of family management styles were identified as follows: stable-resilient, less committed, parents’ mission, and challenging. Among all participants, 19.9%, 30%, 20.6%, and 29.5% belonged to each of these clusters, respectively. The level of family functioning significantly differed between the four clusters, with the stable-resilient cluster having the highest mean level and the challenging cluster having the lowest mean level. Parents’ perceived the complexity of self-managing their child's condition as one of the factors differentiating the level of family functioning of each cluster. Conclusions: This study identified four clusters of family management styles and showed that each cluster was associated with a different level of family functioning. The unique characteristics of the four clusters may be helpful in providing individualized care and promoting positive family functioning in families with children having chronic atopic disease. © 2020","Allergic; Asthma; Atopic; Child; Chronic disease; Cluster analysis; Dermatitis; Family; Family relations; Rhinitis",,,,,,"NRF-2014R1A1A1004497","This study was funded by the National Research Foundation of South Korea (NRF-2014R1A1A1004497).",,,,"Asher, M.I., Montefort, S., Björkstén, B., Lai, C.K.W., Strachan, D.P., Weiland, S.K., Williams, H., Group, I.P.T.S., Worldwide time trends in the prevalence of symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema in childhood: ISAAC Phases One and Three repeat multicountry cross-sectional surveys (2006) Lancet, 368, pp. 733-743; Beacham, B.L., Deatrick, J.A., Children with chronic conditions: perspectives on condition management (2015) J.

We aimed to identify multimorbidity patterns in Korean adults to clarify the associations between dietary factors and CMP. Nationally representative data of 9011 Korean adults aged 19–64 years were obtained from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) from the period 2013 to 2015. Multimorbidity patterns for CMP, inflammatory disease, cancer and other disease patterns were identified by exploratory factor analysis. Dietary factors including food and nutrient intake and dietary habits were evaluated. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models examined the associations between dietary factors and CMP. More than half of the multimorbidity patterns were CMP (n = 4907, 54.5%); CMP subjects were more likely to be older, male, less educated, lower income, laborers, smokers, and high-risk consumers of alcohol than those of non-CMP subjects. A higher intake of calcium (OR = 0.809, 95% CI = 0.691–0.945), potassium (OR = 0.838, 95% CI = 0.704–0.998), and fruits (OR = 0.841, 95% CI = 0.736–0.960) were inversely associated with the prevalence of CMP, while the consumption of irregular meals (OR = 1.164, 95% CI = 1.034–1.312) and skipping breakfast (OR = 1.279, 95% CI = 1.078–1.518) was positively related to a 16% and 28% higher likelihood of CMP, respectively. CMP accounts for more than half of the multimorbidity patterns in the Korean population, and lower intake of calcium, potassium, fruits, and skipping meals have strong associations with CMP. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: Samples were collected from the lesions on the face, upper limbs and back of 10 AD patients, who visited the Department of Dermatology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College from September to October in 2015, and collected from the corresponding body sites of 10 healthy controls. DNA was extracted from the samples, and subjected to MiSeq high-throughput sequencing for diversity index analysis, species composition analysis and principal component analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out by using two-independent-sample t test for comparisons between two groups, one-way analysis of variance for comparisons among multiple groups, and least significant difference-t test for multiple comparisons. Results: Diversity index analysis showed that Shannon index was significantly higher in the samples from the lesions on the face, upper limbs and back of the AD patient group than in those from corresponding body sites of the healthy control group (t = 2.67, 2.37, 3.34 respectively, all P < 0.05). Species composition analysis showed that Malassezia was predominant in the skin samples from the face, upper limbs and back of the AD patient group and healthy control group, and the total abundance of Malassezia globosa and Malassezia restricta was about 80%. The abundance of Candida and Aspergillus in the total samples was significantly higher in the AD patient group than in the healthy control group (t = 3.515, 2.137 respectively, both P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the abundance of major fungal genera on the face between the AD patient group and healthy control group (all P > 0.05); the abundance of Candida in the upper limbs was significantly higher in the AD patient group than in the healthy control group (t = 3.186, P < 0.05), and the abundance of Aspergillus in the back was significantly higher in the AD patient group than in the healthy control group (t = 2.736, P < 0.05). In either the AD patient group or the healthy control group, there was no significant difference in the abundance of major fungal genera among samples from the face, upper limbs and back (all P > 0.05). Moreover, no significant difference in the abundance of major fungal genera was observed among the mild, moderate and severe AD patient groups (all P > 0.05). Principal component analysis showed that fungal communities in the samples from the lesions on the face, upper limbs and back of the AD patient group were not clustered by the disease severity. Conclusions: The diversity of fungal communities is significantly higher in the lesions on the face, upper limbs and back of the AD patients than in the normal skin at the corresponding body sites of the healthy controls. Malassezia is the dominant fungal genus in both lesions of the AD patients and normal skin of the healthy controls at the above body sites. The composition of fungal communities in lesional samples may be uncorrelated with the disease severity in AD patients.

We therefore aimed to develop a CADIS short-form. Methods: Parents of 300 children completed the prototype CADIS. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the 45-item CADIS version. The most representative items were chosen. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to confirm the a priori factor structure. Content validity was assessed in a focus group of patients, parents, clinicians, methodologists and industry delegates. Internal consistency, 48-h test–retest reliability, construct validity and responsiveness of the newly developed short-form were assessed. Results: A total of 270 families provided data at baseline, 34 after 48 h and 228 after 4 weeks. Fourteen items of three different factors fulfilled the proposed eligibility criteria and were included in the draft short-form. After the content validity rating, one item relating to the child’s sleep was added to further improve content validity. The confirmatory factor analyses showed good model fit, and a 15-item short-form was initiated, the CADIS-SF15. The total scale and the three domains showed good internal consistency and test–retest reliability. The correlation between SCORAD and other subjective measures was consistent with our hypotheses. Differences in scores between mild, moderate and severe AD patients were significant, and the CADIS-SF15 was able to detect changes in ‘improving’ patients over time. Conclusion: The CADIS-SF15 with 15 items in three domains is an internally consistent, reliable, valid, responsive and brief measure of QoL in children affected with AD and their parents. Further evaluation of clinical applicability is required. © 2020 The Authors.

The gut microbiota is essential to maintain physiological homeostasis and immune regulation of host. Therefore, the objectives were to determine the effects of probiotics on the clinical symptoms, immune responses, and gut microbiota in AD patients. Methods: 109 patients were randomly divided into 4 groups, including placebo group, oligosaccharides group, Bifidobacterium bifidum CCFM16 group, and Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610 group. At the end of the experiment, serological indicators, SCORAD, and DLQI indices were assessed. V3–V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was sequenced to evaluate changes in the gut microbiota. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size was used to uncover microbial biomarkers and PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) was used to predict gene family abundances based on 16S information. Results: The results demonstrated that CCFM8610 significantly decreased the SCORAD index, and increased the serum IL-10 levels. Supplement with CCFM8610 and CCFM16 significantly influenced the alpha diversity, increased the proportion of Bacteroidetes, and reduced the F/B ratio. CCFM8610 treatment downregulated the functional genes of gut microbiota involving Staphylococcus aureus infection and upregulated the steroid hormone biosynthesis. Conclusion: The results indicated a positive correlation between decreased SCORAD index and CCFM8610 treatment, and that CCFM8610 regulated the immune responses in AD patients. CCFM8610 treatment influences the gut microbiota composition and functional changes. In conclusion, L. plantarum CCFM8610 exerts the strain-specific amelioration effects on patients with AD.

A questionnaire was presented to the parents concerning possible consanguinity, prematurity of the child, birth order, skin prick test results, presence of animals, indoor dampness, medical history, and cases of atopy among the children and their antecedents. The links between variables were first identified by means of chi-square tests. Ascending hierarchical classification (AHC) was performed to identify significant groupings. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was then carried out to focus on typical children profiles. The results showed a high frequency of bronchitis (86.9%), rhinitis (46.1%), and indoor dampness (64.5%). Family history (asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and atopic dermatitis) and various allergies (to drugs, to food, or other allergies in general) were present mostly in mothers (≈20%) with a slightly significant association between mothers and siblings (P = 0.045) but not between fathers and siblings (P = 0.41). The AHC highlighted two distinct groups, well discriminated: a predominant group with maternal antecedents and another of lesser significance with paternal antecedents. The MCA identified groupings, with positive modalities of variables, largely around boys and paternal antecedents with an impact on girls. This work allowed us to establish a typical profile of children who have developed (or can develop) asthma. They are children with a history of atopy and allergies, mainly of their mothers, who have contracted early bronchitis and probably rhinitis, and who live in an environment with indoor dampness and smoking. © 2020 French Society of Pediatrics","Allergies; Ascending hierarchical analysis, Multiple correspondence analysis, Medical background; Asthma; Rhinitis","adolescent; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; birth order; bronchitis; child; conjunctivitis; consanguinity; disease association; drug hypersensitivity; environmental factor; family history; female; food allergy; genetic background; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; prematurity; prick test; rhinitis; risk factor; smoking",,,,,,"We would like to thank Prof. L.

A further level of complexity opens up as soon as we look at diseases whose pathogenesis and therapy involve different immunological signaling pathways, which are potentially affected by COVID-19. Medical treatments must often be reassessed and questioned in connection with this infection. This article summarizes the current knowledge of COVID-19 in the light of major dermatological and allergological diseases. It identifies medical areas lacking sufficient data and draws conclusions for the management of our patients during the pandemic. We focus on common chronic inflammatory skin diseases with complex immunological pathogenesis: psoriasis, eczema including atopic dermatitis, type I allergies, autoimmune blistering and inflammatory connective tissue diseases, vasculitis, and skin cancers. Since several other inflammatory skin diseases display related or comparable immunological reactions, clustering of the various inflammatory dermatoses into different disease patterns may help with therapeutic decisions. Thus, following these patterns of skin inflammation, our review may supply treatment recommendations and thoughtful considerations for disease management even beyond the most frequent diseases discussed here. © 2020 The Authors.

Although asthma presents various clinical forms with different levels of severity, it is unclear whether asthma severities are a consequence of disease management or varied etiologies. We sought to investigate this question. Methods: This article presents a cross-sectional study of 113,671 Israeli adolescents. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to analyze the independent associations between mild asthma and moderate-to-severe asthma phenotypes and coexistent medical conditions within each gender separately. Hierarchical clustering of the odds ratios of the diverse statistically significant medical conditions associated with asthma severity-gender groups was also performed. We focused on the allergic and neurological-cognitive-mental disorders. Results: Among males, two associations were common to both asthma groups (atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis), five unique to mild asthma (urticaria/angioedema, Hymenoptera/bee allergies, allergic conjunctivitis, epilepsy and migraine) and two unique to moderate-to-severe asthma (learning disabilities and ADD/ADHD (Attention-deficit disorder/Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder)). Among females, two associations were common to both clinical asthma groups (allergic rhinitis and urticaria/angioedema), and five unique to moderate-to-severe asthma (atopic dermatitis, learning disabilities, ADD/ADHD, anxiety/mood disorders and migraine). Allergic rhinitis was the only condition to be associated with all four groups. Learning disabilities and ADD/ADHD were only associated with moderate-to-severe asthma (but not with mild asthma), in both males and females. Hierarchical clustering analysis uncovered two prominent clusters, separating mild from moderate-to-severe asthma. Conclusions: The differences between mild and moderate-to-severe asthma enhance asthma phenotype characterization, with respect to comorbidities, and indicate varied etiologies. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adolescents; Asthma phenotypes; asthma severity; comorbidities; hierarchical clustering","adolescent; allergic conjunctivitis; allergic rhinitis; angioneurotic edema; anxiety disorder; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; attention deficit disorder; bee sting; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease severity; epilepsy; female; gender; hierarchical clustering; human; Israel; learning disorder; major clinical study; male; mental disease; migraine; mood disorder; neurologic disease; phenotype; pneumothorax; urticaria",,,,,,,,,,"Masoli, M., Fabian, D., Holt, S., Beasley, R., The global burden of asthma: executive summary of the GINA Dissemination Committee report (2004) Allergy, 59, pp. 469-478. , Epub 2004/04/15; Asher, I., Pearce, N., Global burden of asthma among children (2014) Int J Tuberc Lung Dis, 18, pp. 1269-1278. , Epub 2014/10/10; Bateman, E.D., Jithoo, A., Asthma and allergy - a global perspective (2007) Allergy, 62, pp. 213-215. , Epub 2007/02/15; Palomares, O., Akdis, M., Martin-Fontecha, M., Akdis, C.A., Mechanisms of immune regulation in allergic diseases: the role of regulatory T and B cells (2017) Immunol Rev, 278, pp. 219-236. , Epub 2017/06/29; Miyasaka, T., Dobashi-Okuyama, K., Takahashi, T., Takayanagi, M., Ohno, I., The interplay between neuroendocrine activity and psychological stress-induced exacerbation of allergic asthma (2017) Allergol Int, 67, pp. 32-42. , Epub 2017/05/26. :,.

Objectives: The psychometric properties of a translated Chinese version of the Parental Self-Efficacy with Eczema Care Index (C-PASECI) were examined. Methods: The PASECI was translated in a 2-stage process involving both forward and backward translation. Subsequently, the psychometric properties of the C-PASECI were examined in a cohort of 147 Chinese parents or caregivers of children with eczema. Specifically, the internal consistency, 2-day test-retest reliability and construct validity were assessed. Results: The C-PASECI received a Cronbach's αof 0.97, and the intraclass correlation coefficients of each item ranged from 0.93 to 0.99. Negative correlations were observed among the C-PASECI, Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index and Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Scale scores, indicating the acceptable convergent validity of the C-PASECI. The moderate correlation observed between the C-PASECI and General Self-Efficacy Scale (Pearson's r = 0.53, p < 0.001) reflected the acceptable concurrent validity of the C-PASECI. The results of confirmatory factor analysis supported the factorial validity of the C-PASECI. Conclusion: The C-PASECI appears to be a reliable and valid measure of parental self-efficacy in Chinese parents or caregivers of children with eczema. © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Multiple variants of AD exist with different outcomes in response to therapies. The evaluation of disease progression and response to treatment are observational assessments with poor inter-observer agreement highlighting the need for molecular markers. SHARPIN-deficient mice (Sharpincpdm) spontaneously develop chronic proliferative dermatitis with features similar to AD in humans. To study the changes in the epidermal lipid-content during disease progression, we tested 72 epidermis samples from three groups (5-, 7-, and 10-weeks old) of cpdm mice and their WT littermates. An agnostic mass-spectrometry strategy for biomarker discovery termed multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling was used to detect and monitor 1,030 lipid ions present in the epidermis samples. In order to select the most relevant ions, we utilized a two-tiered filter/wrapper feature-selection strategy. Lipid categories were compressed, and an elastic-net classifier was used to rank and identify the most predictive lipid categories for sex, phenotype, and disease stages of cpdm mice. The model accurately classified the samples based on phospholipids, cholesteryl esters, acylcarnitines, and sphingolipids, demonstrating that disease progression cannot be defined by one single lipid or lipid category. © 2020 by the authors.

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States","Background: The heterogeneity of depressive symptoms in suicidality is poorly understood. This study examines the heterogeneous association between subfactors of depressive symptoms in suicidality. Methods: The data of 5742 participants aged 19 and older were taken from the 2014 and 2016 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and analyzed. Subfactors of depressive symptoms were identified utilizing factor analyses that yielded two groups (typical- and other-depressive factors). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between each factor and suicidality after adjusting for covariates. Results: Typical depressive factors included cardinal and somatic symptoms, whereas other depressive factors contained cognitive and other symptoms. The typical factors were associated with each suicidality in succession, however, others depressive factors were not. The heterogeneity of subfactors made the greatest impact on suicide attempts, controlling for all covariates, followed by suicide plans, with a robust coefficient of typical depressive factors. These differential patterns of subfactors existed especially in females and younger people, suggesting the importance of concerning typical depressive factors for those groups. Limitations: Although a confirmatory factor analysis was performed, depressive subfactors need validation and reliability tests. Conclusions: Our study findings may help to explain why an improved understanding of the typical depressive factors including cardinal and somatic symptoms is important to prevent suicidality, especially in females and younger people. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Depressive symptoms; Factor analysis; Suicidal ideation; Suicidality; Suicide attempt; Suicide plan","alcohol; adult; alcohol consumption; angina pectoris; arthritis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; cerebrovascular accident; Charlson Comorbidity Index; cigarette smoking; cognition; college; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; depression; diabetes mellitus; disease association; divorced person; ex-smoker; family income; female; heart infarction; hepatitis B; high school; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; married person; middle school; never smoker; osteoporosis; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; physical activity; priority journal; rhinitis; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; suicide plan; validation study; widowed person; epidemiology; health survey; nutrition; reproducibility; risk factor; South Korea; suicide; young adult; Adult; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Nutrition Surveys; Reproducibility of Results; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Young Adult",,"alcohol, 64-17-5",,,"2018R1C1B5083722, 2020R1C1C1003502

AD). We examined the symptoms related to asthma and AD and the plasma levels of 72 cytokines/chemokines obtained from a general population of 161 children at 6 years of age who participated in a pilot birth cohort study of the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS). The children whose signs and symptoms fulfilled the criteria of AD, which are mostly based on questionnaire including past symptoms, tended to have higher levels of the two chemokine ligands, CCL17 and CCL27, which are used for diagnosis of AD. On the other hand, another AD-related chemokine CCL22 level in plasma was higher only in children with visible flexural eczema, which is one of AD diagnostic criteria but was judged on the same day of blood examination unlike other criteria. Here, we also developed an innovative method of machine learning for elucidating the complex cytokine/chemokine milieu related to symptoms of allergic diseases by using clustering analysis based on the random forest dissimilarity measure that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) technique. To our surprise, the majority of children showing at least any asthma-related symptoms during the last month were divided by AI into the two clusters, either cluster-2 having elevated levels of IL-33 (related to eosinophil activation) or cluster-3 having elevated levels of CXCL7/NAP2 (related to neutrophil activation), among the total three clusters. Future studies will clarify better approach for allergic diseases by endotype classification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Asthma; Atopic dermatitis; Child; Cohort study; Machine learning","chemokine; cutaneous T cell attracting chemokine; cytokine; macrophage derived chemokine; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; Article; artificial intelligence; asthma; atopic dermatitis; blood examination; child; clinical feature; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; eczema; exploratory research; female; human; leukocyte activation; machine learning; major clinical study; male; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor",,"thymus and activation regulated chemokine, 181532-29-6",,,"National Institute for Environmental Studies, NIES","The Japan Environment and Children's Study Pilot Study was funded by the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan.

The polysaccharide-based nano-conjugate was used as pH-responsive compound in the formulation and its amphiphilic character was determined colorimetrically. Microstructure analysis by SEM and TEM indicated highly porous hydrogel network and well-dispersed micellar structures, respectively, after modification with the nano-conjugate, and so, release property of the hydrogel for drug was significantly improved. Different pH-conditions were applied here to see pH-responsiveness of the formulation and increase in acidity of external environment gradually diminished mechanical stability of the hydrogel and that was reflected on the drug release property. Rheology was performed to observe sol-gel transition of the formulation and showed better rheological properties after modification with nano-conjugate. In this study, the cytotoxicity results of PF127 based formulations loaded with/without gallic acid showed cell viability of > 80.0 % for human HaCaT keratinocytes in the concentration range of 0.0–20.0 μg/ml. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol: 6825 (PubChem CID), Dichloromethane: 12222467 (PubChem CID); Chitosan oligosaccharide: 3086191 (PubChem CID); Drug delivery; Dual-responsive; Ethanol: 702 (Pubmed CID); Gallic acid: 370 (PubChem CID); Hyaluronic acid: 24847767 (PubChem CID); Hydrogel; L-alanine: 5950 (PubChem CID); N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N´-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride: 2723939 (PubChem CID); N-hydroxysuccinimide: 80170 (PubChem CID); Nano-conjugate; Phosphotungstic acid hydrate: 16212977 (PubChem CID); Poloxamer 407 (pluronic F-127): 71853 (PubChem CID); Polysaccharide; Transdermal therapy","Amino acids; Chitosan; Dichloromethane; Drug delivery; Hyaluronic acid; Hydrogels; Mechanical stability; Medicine; Oligosaccharides; Polysaccharides; Sol-gels; Targeted drug delivery; Dual-responsive; Nano-conjugate; Pluronic F-127; Pubchem; Transdermal; Controlled drug delivery; chitin; gallic acid; hyaluronic acid; nanoconjugate; oligochitosan; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; drug release; human; hydrogel; pH; synthesis; toxicity; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Chitin; Drug Liberation; Gallic Acid; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Hydrogels; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Nanoconjugates",,"chitin, 1398-61-4; gallic acid, 149-91-7; hyaluronic acid, 31799-91-4, 9004-61-9, 9067-32-7; Chitin; Gallic Acid; Hyaluronic Acid; Hydrogels; Nanoconjugates; oligochitosan",,,"Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU: 1-ZVLM","This study was supported by the Block Grant of the Faculty of Applied Science and Textiles, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Ref: 1-ZVLM ).

Differences in prevalence of childhood eczema between countries and ethnicities suggest that genetic and early modifiable environmental factors, such as dietary intake, may underlie this observation. To investigate the association between pregnancy diet and infant eczema in a consortium of prospective Canadian birth cohorts predominantly comprised of white Europeans and South Asians. Methods We evaluated the association of maternal dietary patterns reported during pregnancy (assessed at 24–28 weeks gestation using a semi-quantitiative food-frequency questionnaire) with parent-reported physician-diagnosed infant eczema at 1-year from 2,160 mother-infant pairs. Using three dietary patterns (“Western”, “plant-based”, and “Balanced”) previously derived in this cohort using principal component analysis, we used multivariable logistic regression to determine the association of these dietary patterns with infant eczema, adjusted for potential confounders. Results We observed a lower odds of eczema in the full sample combining white Europeans and South Asians with greater adherence to a plant-based (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.76; <0.001) and Western dietary pattern (OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.89; P<0.01), after adjusting for other known predictors of eczema, including ethnicity, which was not significant. No associations were observed for the balanced diet. An interaction between the Western diet and ethnicity was observed (P<0.001). Following stratification by ethnicity, a protective association between the plant-based diet and infant eczema was confirmed in both white Europeans (OR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.74; P<0.001) and South Asians (OR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.97; P = 0.025). In white Europeans only, a Western diet was associated with a lower odds of infant eczema (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.87; P = 0.001) while a balanced diet increased the odds of infant eczema (OR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.49; P = 0.03). Beyond a plant-based diet, no significant associations with other dietary patterns were observed in South Asians. Conclusion A plant-based diet during pregnancy is associated with a lowered odds of infant eczema at 1 year in all participants. Future studies of the components of plant-based diet which underlie the lower risk of eczema are needed. © 2020 Zulyniak et al.

IBD are complex, multi-factorial disorders, in which genetic factors play a major role, the so-called phenomenon of familial aggregation or clustering of IBD. A positive family history of IBD is often reported among CD and UC probands, with percentages depending on the geographic context in which the studies are carried out. Israel is a complex and pluralistic society comprising of two major ethno-national groups (Arabs and Jewish) and, as such, represents a unique living laboratory in which to test the role of genetic factors in the development of IBD as well as of associated autoimmune disorders (ADs). While some studies have found a lower prevalence of ADs among Arabs when compared to Jews, few studies directly compared the two ethnicities. METHODS: The present case-control study was designed to compare the rate of ADs in first- and second-degree relatives of IBD patients, stratified according to Jewish or Arabic ethnicity. RESULTS: We found that first-degree relatives of Jews patients had a higher risk of developing ADs (OR=1.89, P=0.0086). Classifying ADs into systemic and local (endocrinological, gastrointestinal, dermatological, and neurological) types, first-degree relatives of Jews patients had a higher OR of developing local ADs (OR=2.12, P=0.0056). CONCLUSIONS: Israeli Jewish IBD patients had more first-degree relatives with local ADs as compared to Arab patients. © 2019 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.","Arabs; Inflammatory bowel diseases; Jews; Medical history taking","adolescent;

We aimed to identify effects of parenting stress and co-parenting on marital conflict among parents of children with atopic dermatitis. Methods: Participants were 161 fathers and 161 mothers raising seven-year-old children treated for atopic dermatitis. To confirm the effects of parenting stress and co-parenting on marital conflict, the ""actor-partner interdependence mediation model"" was used. To verify goodness-of-fit, maximum likelihood method was used, and a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to confirm the validity of latent variables for model analysis. Results: Fathers' parenting stress had actor (β = -.46, p <.001) and partner (β = -.22, p <.001) effects on co-parenting, and mothers' parenting stress had actor (β = -.20, p <.001) and partner (β = -.36, p <.001) effects on co-parenting. Fathers' parenting stress only had an actor effect on marital conflict (β =.32, p <.001). Father's co-parenting had actor (β = -.29, p <.001) and partner (β = -.22, p <.001) effects on marital conflict, and mothers' co-parenting had actor (β = -.39, p <.001) and partner (β = -.19, p <.001) effects on marital conflict. There were significant differences between the two groups concerning three path coefficients: fathers' parenting stress affected fathers' marital conflict, fathers' co-parenting affected fathers' marital conflict, and mothers' co-parenting affected fathers' marital conflict. Conclusions: It is vital for healthcare providers to seek ways to reduce the marital conflicts of parents of children with atopic dermatitis, including further examination of the role of co-parenting, to address children's physical symptoms and promote their health. Our findings inform management and intervention programs for the families of children with atopic dermatitis. © 2020 The Author(s).","Child; Conflict; Dermatitis; Parents; Stress","adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; child; child rearing; cross-sectional study; education; employment status; family conflict; father; female; household income; human; major clinical study; male; maternal attitude; mother; parental behavior; parental stress; paternal attitude; school child",,,,,,,,,,"Wang, I.J., Wang, J.Y., Yeh, K.W., Childhood atopic dermatitis in Taiwan (2016) Pediatr Neonatol, 57, pp. 89-96; (2016) National Health & Nutrition Examination Survey 7th.

The study aimed to determine if either regular skin emollients applied from 2 weeks of age, or early complementary feeding introduced between 12 and 16 weeks of age, reduced development of atopic dermatitis by age 12 months in the general infant population. Methods: This population-based 2×2 factorial, randomised clinical trial was done at Oslo University Hospital and Østfold Hospital Trust, Oslo, Norway; and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Infants of women recruited antenatally at the routine ultrasound pregnancy screening at 18 weeks were cluster-randomised at birth from 2015 to 2017 to the following groups: (1) controls with no specific advice on skin care while advised to follow national guidelines on infant nutrition (no intervention group); (2) skin emollients (bath additives and facial cream; skin intervention group); (3) early complementary feeding of peanut, cow's milk, wheat, and egg (food intervention group); or (4) combined skin and food interventions (combined intervention group). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) using computer- generated cluster randomisation based on 92 geographical living area blocks as well as eight 3-month time blocks. Carers were instructed to apply the interventions on at least 4 days per week. Atopic dermatitis by age 12 months was the primary outcome, based on clinical investigations at 3, 6 and 12 months by investigators masked to group allocation. Atopic dermatitis was assessed after completing the 12-month investigations and diagnosed if either of the UK Working Party and Hanifin and Rajka (12 months only) diagnostic criteria were fulfilled. The primary efficacy analyses was done by intention-to-treat analysis on all randomly assigned participants. Food allergy results will be reported once all investigations at age 3 years are completed in 2020. This was a study performed within ORAACLE (the Oslo Research Group of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood; the Lung and Environment). The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02449850. Findings: 2697 women were recruited between Dec 9, 2014, and Oct 31, 2016, from whom 2397 newborn infants were enrolled from April 14, 2015, to April 11, 2017. Atopic dermatitis was observed in 48 (8%) of 596 infants in the no intervention group, 64 (11%) of 575 in the skin intervention group, 58 (9%) of 642 in the food intervention group, and 31 (5%) of 583 in the combined intervention group. Neither skin emollients nor early complementary feeding reduced development of atopic dermatitis, with a risk difference of 3·1% (95% CI –0·3 to 6·5) for skin intervention and 1·0% (–2·1 to 4·1) for food intervention, in favour of control. No safety concerns with the interventions were identified. Reported skin symptoms and signs (including itching, oedema, exanthema, dry skin, and urticaria) were no more frequent in the skin, food, and combined intervention groups than in the no intervention group. Interpretation: Neither early skin emollients nor early complementary feeding reduced development of atopic dermatitis by age 12 months. Our study does not support the use of these interventions to prevent atopic dermatitis by 12 months of age in infants.

Concurrently, the same ORF was identified in a bovine isolate of S. aureus and designated SElY (H. K. Ono, Y. Sato'o, K. Narita, I. Naito, et al., Appl Environ Microbiol 81:7034 -7040, 2015, https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01873-15). Recombinant SElYbov had superantigen activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It further demonstrated emetic activity in a primate animal model, and it was proposed that SElY be renamed SEY (H. K. Ono, S. Hirose, K. Narita, M. Sugiyama, et al., PLoS Pathog 15:e1007803, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007803). Here, we investigated the prevalence of the sey gene in 270 human clinical isolates of various origins in Japan. Forty-two strains were positive for the sey gene, and the positive isolates were from patients with the skin diseases atopic dermatitis and impetigo/ staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), with a detection rate of ~17 to 22%. There were three variants of SEY (SEY1, SEY2, and SEY3), and isolates producing SEY variants formed three distinct clusters corresponding to clonal complexes (CCs) 121, 59, and 20, respectively. Most sey+ isolates produced SEY in broth culture. Unlike SEYbov, the three recombinant SEY variants exhibited stability against heat treatment. SEY predominantly activated human T cells with a particular T-cell receptor (TCR) Vα profile, a unique observation since most staphylococcal enterotoxins exert their superantigenic activities through activating T cells with specific TCR Vβ profiles. SEY may act to induce localized inflammation via skin-resident T-cell activation, facilitating the pathogenesis of S. aureus infection in disrupted epithelial barriers.

Objective: Our aim was to examine the differences in sensitization patterns at ages 5 years and 9 years to identify longitudinal changes in the degree and patterns of sensitization in a birth cohort of Japanese children. Methods: Our study enrolled 984 children at aged 5 years between 2008 and 2010, and 729 children aged 9 years between 2012 and 2014. Allergic diseases were assessed using the ISAAC and UK Working Party's Diagnostic Criteria. Serum-specific IgE titers to allergen components were measured by multiplex array ImmunoCAP ISAC when the children were aged 5 and 9 years. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to characterize IgE sensitization to allergen components. Results: The prevalence of allergic rhinitis increased considerably over time (10.6%–31.2%). Furthermore, the sensitization prevalence to allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) also increased from 57.8% at age 5 years to 74.8% at age 9 years. IgE sensitization prevalence to Der f 1 (mites) was 42.1% at age 5 years and 54.3% at age 9 years. Furthermore, children were highly sensitized to Cry j 1 (Japanese cedar) (32.8% at age 5 years and 57.8% at age 9 years). Principle component analysis showed that sensitization to PR-10 cross-reactive components was independent of sensitization to mite and that no children acquired sensitization to pollen before acquiring sensitization to mite. Conclusions: The prevalence of allergic rhinitis and related allergen components increased from age 5 years to age 9 years in Japanese children. © 2020 The Author(s)","Allergy; Asthma; Atopic dermatitis; Child; Cohort; Eczema; IgE; ISAAC; ISAC; Prospective birth cohort; Rhinitis; Sensitization; Wheeze","allergen; immunoglobulin E; allergic rhinitis; allergy; antibody titer; Article; child; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross reaction; disease classification; female; house dust allergy; human; immune response; immunoassay; Japan; Japanese cedar; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mite; parent; physical examination; pollen; preschool child; prevalence; principal component analysis; priority journal; questionnaire; school child; sensitization",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,"National Center for Child Health and Development, NCCHD: 26-18","This study was supported by a grant from the National Center for Child Health and Development (26-18) .",,,,"Pawankar, R., Allergic diseases and asthma: a global public health concern and a call to action (2014) World Allergy Organ J, 7 (1), p. 12; Futamura, M., Ohya, Y., Akashi, M., Age-related prevalence of allergic diseases in Tokyo schoolchildren (2011) Allergol Int, 60 (4), pp. 509-515; Yang, L., Narita, M., Yamamoto-Hanada, K., Sakamoto, N., Saito, H., Ohya, Y., Phenotypes of childhood wheeze in Japanese children: A group-based trajectory analysis (2018) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 29 (6), pp. 606-611; Matricardi, P.M., Kleine-Tebbe, J., Hoffmann, H.J., EAACI molecular allergology user's guide (2016) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 27, pp. 1-250; Skrindo, I., Lupinek, C., Valenta, R., The use of the MeDALL-chip to assess IgE sensitization: a new diagnostic tool for allergic disease?

Method: The complete dermatological and allergological examination including the examination of the sensitisation to molecular components with Multiplex ISAC testing was performed. The cluster analysis of molecular components (silhouette value) was processed. Results and conclusion: Altogether 100 atopic dermatitis patients were examined - 48 men, 52 women, the average age 40.9 years. We found 10 clusters with different numbers of molecular components. Fundamental position have the components Phl p 1 (Timothy), Bet v 1 (Birch), Alt a 1 (Alternaria) followed by molecular components of NPC2 family, cystein proteasa, tropomyosin, uteroglobin, lipocalin and PR-10 protein. Our results correspond to the association of molecular components into protein families according to their biochemical structure. © 2020 The Author(s).

Few data are available about AD phenotypes and their nationwide distribution. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional multicenter study involving some of the main Italian pediatric allergy centers from 9 Italian cities. A structured questionnaire was administered to 371 children with AD. Patients were divided in 2 groups: preschool children (aged ≤5 years) and schoolchildren (aged 6-14 years). A latent class analysis was used to detect AD phenotypes and to investigate their association with risk factors and other atopic diseases. Results: Latent class analysis identified 5 AD phenotypes in preschoolers (“moderate-severe AD, high comorbidity”, 8%; “moderate-severe AD, low comorbidity”, 35%; “mild AD, low comorbidity”, 20%; “mild AD, respiratory comorbidity”, 32%; “mild AD, food-induced comorbidity”, 5%) and 4 AD phenotypes in schoolchildren (“moderate-severe AD, high comorbidity”, 24%; “moderate-severe AD, low comorbidity”, 10%; “mild AD, low comorbidity”, 16%; “mild AD, respiratory comorbidity”, 49%). Parental history of asthma and eczema, early day-care attendance, and exposure to molds were significantly associated with the “moderate-severe AD, high comorbidity” phenotype in preschool children (P<.05). The “moderate-severe AD” phenotypes were also associated with the highest burden in terms of medication use and limitations in daily activities. Conclusions: The detection of different AD phenotypes highlights the need for a stratified approach to the management of this complex disease and for further studies to predict the course of AD and to develop more efficient therapeutic strategies. © 2020 Esmon Publicidad.","Atopic dermatitis; Environment and hygiene hypothesis; Epidemiology; Pediatrics; Quality of life","antibiotic agent; antifungal agent; antihistaminic agent; calcineurin inhibitor; corticosteroid; immunoglobulin E; adolescent; allergic asthma; allergic rhinitis; allergy; anaphylaxis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; comorbidity; conjunctivitis; cross-sectional study; disease association; disease severity; drug use; eczema; environmental factor; female; food allergy; hospital admission; human; latent class analysis; male; multicenter study; phenotype; preschool child; prick test; rhinoconjunctivitis; risk factor; school child; Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis; sleep quality; smoking; structured questionnaire; urticaria; wheezing",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,,"Silverberg, J.I., Thyssen, J.P., Paller, A.S., Drucker, A.M., Wollenberg, A., Lee, K.H., What's in a name?

This requires an urgent need to develop an objective and non-invasive method to examine the skin condition before and during the therapy. The newest clinical research mention the benefit of using high frequency ultrasound to image inflammation of the skin. A characteristic feature of inflammatory dermatoses is the presence of a superficial hypoechoic band below the echo entry in high frequency ultrasound images. Its measurement can be useful in the assessment of atopic dermatitis. To meet this need, this paper presents a novel fully automatic method for the characteristic hypoechoic band segmentation. A three step methodology includes epidermis echo entry layer detection and segmentation and on this basis the segmentation of the sought skin abnormality. The algorithm is dedicated to 75MHz US probe, which enables visualisation of a skin area of a 12mm length and 4mm depth. The accuracy of the proposed framework was verified on 45 clinical images annotated by two independent experts. The obtained results prove the benefits of using the ultrasound-based skin disease assessment framework. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","atopic dermatitis; epidermis segmentation; high frequency ultrasound; segmentation; skin layers","Clinical research; Dermatitis; Dermatology; Image segmentation; Noninvasive medical procedures; Ultrasonic applications; Atopic dermatitis; Automatic method; Clinical images; High frequency ultrasounds; Noninvasive methods; Skin conditions; Skin disease; Skin layer; Computer aided diagnosis; algorithm; Article; atopic dermatitis; clinical research; computer assisted diagnosis; controlled study; detection algorithm; fuzzy c means clustering; human; image segmentation; non invasive procedure; priority journal; segmentation algorithm; skin disease assessment; skin penetration; ultrasound",,,,,"BKM-519/RIB1/2018

Such disease persistence cannot yet be predicted. The aim of the present study was to predict the natural course of AD using clinical parameters and serum proteins. Methods: Sera of 144 children with AD (age 0-3 years) were analyzed for IgE and 33 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Patient disease course until the age of 7 years was assessed retrospectively. Unsupervised k-means clustering was performed to define disease endotypes. Identified factors associated with AD persistence at the age of 7 years were validated in children with AD in an independent cohort (LISA Munich; n = 168). Logistic regression and XGBoosting methods followed by cross-validation were applied to predict individual disease outcomes. Results: Three distinct endotypes were found in infancy, characterized by a unique inflammatory signature. Factors associated with disease persistence were disease score (SCORAD), involvement of the limbs, flexural lesion distribution at the age of 3 years, allergic comorbidities, and disease exacerbation by the trigger factors stress, pollen exposure, and change in weather. Persistence was predicted with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 82.4%. Factors with a high impact on the prediction of persistence were SCORAD at the age of 3 years, trigger factors, and low VEGF serum levels. Conclusion: Atopic dermatitis in infancy comprises three immunological endotypes. Disease persistence can be predicted using serum cytokines and clinical variables. © 2020 The Authors.

This predominantly pediatric disease is becoming more and more prevalent. Emollients are part of the therapeutic management and particularly a way to increase time between relapses. The follow-up of AD and relapses have a great impact on patient’s quality of life, expenditures and society costs. The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of different emollients prescribed to AD patients. Methods: A three-state Markov simulation model was developed over a six-year period with 28 days cycles. Two perspectives were adopted, a health care system perspective and a societal perspective. Four different emollients (A, B, C, D) were compared with no emollient use. Time without flare-up was the key endpoint of the study. quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assessed as a secondary outcome. Cost and effectiveness data were derived from (i) randomized clinical trials and literature review for the efficacy of treatments, (ii) resource utilization and quality of life data, and (iii) unit prices from official price lists. Results: The six-year health care costs associated with emollient A amount to £1844.23 and generate 4.58 years-without flare-up. Compared to emollient B, emollient A is costlier (Δ £41) but more effective (0.097 years). The ICER is £428.30 per year without flare-up. Emollient A is the dominant strategy compared to no treatment (£2,251.01; 3.99 years without flare-ups). When accounting for the societal costs, emollient A is the dominant strategy. Discussion: According to the analysis, treatment with preventive emollient was a cost-effective option compared with no treatment in adult AD patients. In this comparative study, emollient A is the most efficient strategy from a willingness to pay £200 with a probability of 49%. © 2020 Cabout et al.","Atopic dermatitis; Cost-effectiveness; Markov model","corticosteroid; emollient A; emollient agent; emollient B; emollient C; emollient D; unclassified drug; Article; atopic dermatitis; child; drug efficacy; female; health care; health care cost; human; major clinical study; male; Markov chain; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; relapse; school child",,,,,,,,,,"Williams, H, Robertson, C, Stewart, A, Worldwide variations in the prevalence of symptoms of atopic eczema in the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood (1999) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 103 (1), pp. 125-138; Lavery, M, Stull, C, Kinney, M, Yosipovitch, G., Nocturnal pruritus: the battle for a peaceful night’s sleep (2016) Int J Mol Sci, 17 (3), p. 425; Ma, L, Li, P, Tang, J, Prolonging time to flare in pediatric atopic dermatitis: a randomized, investigator-blinded, controlled, multicenter clinical study of a ceramide-containing moisturizer (2017) Adv Ther, 34 (12), pp. 2601-2611; Wirén, K, Nohlgård, C, Nyberg, F, Treatment with a barrier-strengthening moisturizing cream delays relapse of atopic der-matitis: a prospective and randomized controlled clinical trial (2009) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol JEADV, 23 (11), pp. 1267-1272; van Zuuren, EJ, Fedorowicz, Z, Christensen, R, Lavrijsen, AP, Arents, BW., Emollients and moisturisers for eczema (2017) Cochrane Database Syst Rev; (2012) The guidelines manual | guidance and guidelines, , https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg6/chapter/assessing-cost-effectiveness#ftn.footnote_14, NICE.

They include phenotypes with differ-ent treatment; allergic or non-allergic rhinitis (AR, nAR), and chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps (CRSwNP, CRSsNP). In clinical practice, these phenotypes are often difficult to distinguish and may overlap. Objective: To evaluate if hierarchical clustering can be used to distinguish these phenotypes based on the presence of nasal polyps, off-seasonal allergic symptoms, and self-reported background characteristics-e.g. atopic dermatitis (AD); and to further analyse the obtained clusters. Methods: We studied a random sample of 74 CRS (chronic rhinosinusitis) patients, and a control group of 80 subjects without CRS with/without AR (tertiary hospitals, 2006-2012). All underwent interview and nasal examination, and filled a questionnaire. Variables regarding demographics, off-seasonal symptoms, and clinical findings were collected. Hierarchical clustering was performed, the obtained clusters were cross-tabulated and analysed. Results: Four clusters were identified; 1: “Severe symptoms and CRSwNP” (n = 29), 2: “Asymptomatic AR and controls” (n = 39), 3: “Moderate symptoms and CRSsNP” (n = 36), and 4: “Symptomatic and AD” (n = 50). Cluster 1 had most sinonasal symptoms, cluster 3 had a high prevalence of facial pain. The presence of AR did not distinguish CRS groups. Of the AR subjects, 51 % belonged to cluster 4, where AR with off-seasonal airway symptoms and AD predominated. Conclusion: Hierarchical clustering can be used to distinguish inflammatory upper airway disease phenotypes. The AR phenotype was subdivided by the presence of AD. Adult AR+ AD patients could benefit from active clinical care of the upper airways also off-season. © 2020, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

Recently, there has been a rising interest in the role the microbiome plays in atopic dermatitis (AD). Furthermore, metagenomic analysis of microbe-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) has revealed the importance and relevance of microbial EVs in human health. Methods: We compared the diversity and proportion of microbial EVs in the sera of 24 AD patients and 49 healthy controls, and developed a diagnostic model. After separating microbial EVs from serum, we specifically targeted the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rDNA gene for amplification and subsequent sequencing. Results: Alpha and beta diversity between controls and AD patients both differed, but only the difference in beta diversity was significant. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in healthy controls and AD patients, accounting for over 85% of the total serum bacterial EVs. Also, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Cyanobacteria relative abundances were significantly different between the AD and control groups. At the genus level, the proportions of Escherichia-Shigella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Enterococcus were drastically altered between the AD and control groups. AD diagnostic models developed using biomarkers selected on the basis of linear discriminant analysis effect size from the class to genus levels all yielded area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of value 1.00. Conclusions: In summary, microbial EVs demonstrated the potential in their use as novel biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Therefore, future work should investigate larger case and control groups with cross-sectional or longitudinal clinical data to explore the utility and validity of serum microbiota EV-based AD diagnosis.

Transcriptomic analysis has advanced our understanding of gene expression in cells and tissues. However, molecular quantitation of cytokine transcripts does not predict the importance of a specific pathway in AD or cellular responses to different inflammatory stimuli. Objectives: To understand changes in keratinocyte transcriptomic programmes in human cutaneous disease during development of inflammation and in response to treatment. Methods: We performed in silico deconvolution of the whole-skin transcriptome. Using co-expression clustering and machine-learning tools, we resolved the gene expression of bulk skin (seven datasets, n = 406 samples), firstly, into keratinocyte phenotypes identified by unsupervised clustering and, secondly, into 19 cutaneous cell signatures of purified populations from publicly available datasets. Results: We identify three unique transcriptomic programmes in keratinocytes – KC1, KC2 and KC17 – characteristic of immune signalling from disease-associated Th cells. We cross-validate those signatures across different skin inflammatory conditions and disease stages and demonstrate that the keratinocyte response during treatment is therapy dependent. Broad-spectrum treatment with ciclosporin ameliorated the KC17 response in AD lesions to a nonlesional immunophenotype, without altering KC2. Conversely, the specific anti-Th2 therapy, dupilumab, reversed the KC2 immunophenotype. Conclusions: Our analysis of transcriptomic signatures in cutaneous disease biopsies reveals the effect of keratinocyte programming in skin inflammation and suggests that the perturbation of a single axis of immune signal alone may be insufficient to resolve keratinocyte immunophenotype abnormalities. © 2020 The Authors.

Objective: We sought to compare immune activation and cytokine polarization in the blood of 0- to 5-year-old (n = 39), 6- to 11-year-old (n = 26), 12- to 17-year-old (n = 21) and 18-year-old or older (n = 43) patients with AD versus age-matched control subjects. Methods: Flow cytometry was used to measure IFN-γ, IL-9, IL-13, IL-17, and IL-22 cytokine levels in CD4+/CD8+ T cells, with inducible costimulator molecule and HLA-DR defining midterm and long-term T-cell activation, respectively, within skin-homing/cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA)+ versus systemic/CLA− T cells. Unsupervised clustering differentiated patients based on their blood biomarker frequencies. Results: Although CLA+ TH1 frequencies were significantly lower in infants with AD versus all older patients (P &lt; .01), frequencies of CLA+ TH2 T cells were similarly expanded across all AD age groups compared with control subjects (P &lt; .05). After infancy, CLA− TH2 frequencies were increased in patients with AD in all age groups, suggesting systemic immune activation with disease chronicity. IL-22 frequencies serially increased from normal levels in infants to highly significant levels in adolescents and adults compared with levels in respective control subjects (P &lt; .01). Unsupervised clustering aligned the AD profiles along an age-related spectrum from infancy to adulthood (eg, inducible costimulator molecule and IL-22). Conclusions: The adult AD phenotype is achieved only in adulthood. Unique cytokine signatures characterizing individual pediatric endotypes might require age-specific therapies. Future longitudinal studies, comparing the profile of patients with cleared versus persistent pediatric AD, might define age-specific changes that predict AD clearance. © 2019 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Atopic dermatitis; cutaneous lymphocyte antigen; endotypes; HLA-DR; IFN-γ; IL-13; IL-22; inducible costimulator molecule; T cell","cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen; HLA DR antigen; inducible T cell costimulator; interleukin 13; interleukin 17; interleukin 22; interleukin 9; cytokine; HLA DR antigen; adolescent; adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; CD4 CD8 ratio; cell expansion; child; comparative study; controlled study; flow cytometry; homing behavior; human; human cell; infant; phenotype; preschool child; priority journal; school child; T lymphocyte subpopulation; Th2 cell; atopic dermatitis; female; immunology; male; newborn; pathology; Th1 cell; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Cytokines; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; HLA-DR Antigens; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Th1 Cells; Th2 Cells",,"interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; interleukin 22, 457106-70-6, 478219-35-1, 554460-75-2; Cytokines; HLA-DR Antigens",,,"National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS: P30 AR057216

Objective: Our aim was to evaluate skin and blood abnormalities in mild, moderate, and severe AD. Methods: Skin and blood samples were obtained from 61 patients with AD (20 with mild or limited disease, 17 with moderate disease, and 24 with severe disease) and 20 healthy subjects. Immune and barrier markers were measured in lesional, nonlesional, and healthy skin by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, and in blood by using the OLINK proteomic assay. Results: Cellular markers of epidermal hyperplasia and T-cell/dendritic cell infiltration were increased in AD tissues of all patients in all severity groups versus in those of controls, whereas downstream TH2 cell–, TH22 cell–, TH1 cell–, and TH17 cell–related mediators demonstrated incremental elevations with increasing disease severity, in both lesional and nonlesional skin. Whereas the levels of the TH2 (IL13, CCL17, and CCL26) and TH22 (IL-22) cytokines were significantly elevated in both AD lesional and nonlesional skin of all patients regardless of the severity of their disease, patients with mild or limited AD showed increases in their levels of TH1 cell (IFNG, CXCL9, and CXCL10) and TH17 cell (IL-17A, CCL20, and CXCL1) markers in lesional but not nonlesional skin. Regulatory T-cell–related mediators (IL-10 and FOXP3) were comparably upregulated in all groups, without displaying the severity-based gradient in other immune axes. Unsupervised clustering aligned samples along a severity spectrum, where nonlesional mild or limited AD skin clustered with the samples from healthy controls. Furthermore, whereas the blood profiles of patients with moderate and severe AD showed gradual increases in the levels of TH1 cell–, TH2 cell–, and TH17 cell–related and atherosclerosis and/or cardiovascular risk (CCL7, FGF21, and IGFBP1) proteins, the blood profiles of patients with mild or limited AD lacked significant differences from those of the controls. Conclusion: Mild and limited AD show high levels of TH2/TH22 cell activation that is primarily localized to skin lesions and lacks the systemic inflammation of moderate and severe disease. © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Atopic dermatitis;

An English-language version of an instrument assessing itch-related cognitions is needed since cognitions can contribute to a worsening of itch, and chronic itch is prevalent in English-speaking counties and internationally. Methods The German Itch Cognitions Questionnaire was translated into English, and cognitive interviewing was conducted to finalize item wording. Internal and test-retest reliability, item discrimination, responsiveness to change, and construct, convergent, and discriminant validity were assessed in a national sample of 137 individuals with chronic itch due to atopic dermatitis or psoriasis recruited online. Results Internal reliability was high with Cronbach's alphas of 0.93 for the Catastrophizing subscale and 0.88-0.90 for Coping. The Pearson's correlation assessing 1-month test-retest reliability for the Catastrophizing subscale was r = 0.62 and for the Coping subscale was r = 0.61. The corrected item-total correlation revealed that items were relatively consistent with the scores for the subscales (with correlations ranging from 0.58 to 0.79), indicating very good item discrimination. Results of factor analysis, convergent and discriminant, and responsiveness to change analyses provided evidence for validity. Conclusions This study showed good psychometric characteristics of the English version of the Itch Cognitions Questionnaire. We suggest that future studies investigate the use of the measure in clinical practice to assist with treatment planning and outcome assessment related to itch as well as address study limitations such as sampling and replication. © 2020 Weeks et al.

Objectives: To investigate further the cumulative effects of a range of n-propanol concentrations relevant at the workplace in healthy and atopic dermatitis (AD) individuals, and study the modulation of the outcomes by co-exposure and host-related factors. Methods: Healthy adult and AD volunteers were exposed to n-propanol concentrations from 30% to 75% in occlusion-modified tandem repeated irritation test with measurements of erythema, transepidermal water loss, capacitance, and the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) levels at baseline and after 96 hours. Results: n-Propanol exerted significant barrier damaging effects even at the lowest concentration in both groups. Exposure to all n-propanol concentrations significantly reduced the NMF levels. Preceding low-grade trauma by occlusion/water exposure reduced the skin irritation threshold in both groups. The differences in the severity of the barrier function impairment after exposure to the same concentrations under the same conditions between the AD and control groups were significant. Conclusions: The negative effects of cumulative exposure to n-propanol in healthy and atopic skin shown in the study suggest the need for critical re-evaluation of its irritant properties in vivo. © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we investigated the association between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants and allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma, alongside heteroplasmy within the mtDNA in subjects with allergic sensitization. We collected genotype data from 973 subjects with allergic sensitization, consisting of 632 children with AD, 498 children with asthma, and 481 healthy controls by extracting DNA from their blood samples. Fisher's exact test was used to investigate mtDNA and nuclear DNA variants related to mitochondrial function (MT-nDNA) to identify their association with allergic diseases. Among the 69 mtDNA variants, rs28357671 located on the MT-ND6 gene displayed statistically significant associations with allergic diseases (Bonferroni-corrected P < 7.25E-4), while 6, 4, and 2 genes were associated with allergic sensitization, AD, and asthma, respectively (P < 0.0002), including NLRX1, OCA2, and CHCHD3 among the MT-nDNA genes. Heteroplasmy of mitochondrial DNA associated with allergic sensitization was evaluated in a separate cohort of patients consisting of 59 subjects with allergic sensitization and 52 controls. Heteroplasmy was verified when a patient carried both alleles of a mitochondrial single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) when clustered. One of the 134 mitochondrial SNPs showed heteroplasmy at a level of 0.4313 when clustering was applied. The probe sequence located at mitochondrial position 16217 and within the D-loop, which acts as a major control site for mtDNA expression. This is the first study to evaluate the association between mitochondrial DNA variants and allergic diseases. A harmonized effect of genes related to mitochondrial function may contribute to the risk of allergic diseases.

Gallic acid, the principal component of the traditional Chinese drug Cortex Moutan was loaded into the hydrogel (PF127/TMC/PEG-HA) for possible application in textile-based transdermal therapy as Cortex Moutan has been proven to be an effective drug for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). TMC and PEG-HA were synthesized, characterized (1H-NMR and FTIR), and added to the formulations to enhance drug release from the hydrogels, and increase the drug targeting of the carriers. The thermo-responsive properties of the hydrogel were assessed by dynamic viscosity analysis and the tube inversion method, and the pH-responsiveness of the formulation was determined by changing the pH of the external media. Rheology study of the hydrogels showed that complex viscosity and storage/loss moduli for PF127/TMC/PEG-HA hydrogel formulation are higher than PF127 hydrogel. The microstructure analysis by reflection SAXS indicated similar type of frozen inhomogeneity of hydrogel formulations. Various characterizations such as FTIR, SEM, TEM, zeta potential, and degradation of the hydrogel formulation indicated that the PF127/TMC/PEG-HA hydrogel showed better physico-chemical properties and morphology than did the PF127 hydrogel, and drug release was also higher for the PF127/TMC/PEG-HA hydrogel than for PF127. The drug release from hydrogels followed more closely first-order rate model than other rate models. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"chitosan; drug carrier; gallic acid; herbaceous agent; hyaluronic acid; poloxamer; atopic dermatitis; chemistry; cutaneous drug administration; drug formulation; drug release; human; hydrogel; medicinal chemistry; permeability; pH; procedures; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; small angle scattering; Streptococcus equi; temperature; textile; transdermal patch; viscosity; Administration, Cutaneous; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Chitosan; Dermatitis, Atopic; Drug Carriers; Drug Compounding; Drug Liberation; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Gallic Acid; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Hydrogels; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Permeability; Poloxamer; Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Scattering, Small Angle; Streptococcus equi; Temperature; Textiles; Transdermal Patch; Viscosity",,"chitosan, 9012-76-4; gallic acid, 149-91-7; hyaluronic acid, 31799-91-4, 9004-61-9, 9067-32-7; poloxamer, 9003-11-6; Chitosan; Drug Carriers; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Gallic Acid; Hyaluronic Acid; Hydrogels; Poloxamer",,,"Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU: 1-ZVLM","This study was supported by the Block Grant of the Faculty of Applied Science and Textiles, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Ref: 1-ZVLM).

Treatment adherence is crucial in symptom management and the effectiveness of eczema management. The Problematic Experiences of Therapy Scale (PETS) is used to assess adherence to treatment among children with eczema. Objective: This study examined the psychometric properties of the translated Chinese version of PETS (C-PETS) among parents and caregivers of children with eczema. Methods: PETS was translated into Chinese and data obtained from a convenience sample of 147 Chinese participants from a regional hospital in Hong Kong. Results: The internal consistency of C-PETS with a Cronbach’s α of 0.93 and good test-retest reliability with weighted Kappa ranging from 0.74 to 0.89 were obtained. Significant positive correlations were found among the C-PETS, Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (r = 0.25, p =.002), and Severity Grading of Atopic Dermatitis scores (r = 0.38, p =.001). A significant negative correlation was found between C-PETS and Chinese adaptation of Generic Self-Efficacy scale (r = −0.40, p =.001). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the data supported the structural validity of C-PETS. Conclusion: This study indicates that C-PETS is a reliable and valid measure to evaluate treatment adherence for Chinese parents and caregivers of children with eczema. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","child; Eczema; Problematic Experiences Of Therapy Scale; treatment adherence","antieczema agent; dermatological agent; adult; Article; caregiver; Dermatology Life Quality Index; eczema; female; Hong Kong; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; middle aged; parent; patient compliance; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; Problematic Experiences of Therapy Scale; Severity Grading of Atopic Dermatitis score; skin disease assessment; test retest reliability; adolescent; child; child parent relation; cross-sectional study; eczema; pathology; patient compliance; procedures; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; translating (language); young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Caregivers; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatologic Agents; Eczema; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parents; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translating; Treatment Adherence and Compliance; Young Adult",,"Dermatologic Agents",,,,,,,,"(2011) Management of atopic eczema in primary care, , http://www.sign.ac.uk, Edinburgh: SIGN,.

Our objective was to determine incidence rates of autoimmune disorders in allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis (ARC), atopic eczema and asthma, and to investigate for co-occurring patterns. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study (1990–2018) employing data extracted from The Health Improvement Network (UK primary care database). The exposure group comprised ARC, atopic eczema and asthma (all ages). For each exposed patient, up to two randomly selected age- and sex-matched controls with no documented allergic disease were used. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) were calculated using Poisson regression. A cross-sectional study was also conducted employing Association Rule Mining (ARM) to investigate disease clusters. Results: 782320, 1393570 and 1049868 patients with ARC, atopic eczema and asthma, respectively, were included. aIRRs of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren’s syndrome, vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, pernicious anaemia, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease and autoimmune thyroiditis were uniformly higher in the three allergic diseases compared with controls. Specifically, aIRRs of SLE (1.45) and Sjögren’s syndrome (1.88) were higher in ARC; aIRRs of SLE (1.44), Sjögren’s syndrome (1.61) and myasthenia (1.56) were higher in asthma; and aIRRs of SLE (1.86), Sjögren’s syndrome (1.48), vitiligo (1.54) and psoriasis (2.41) were higher in atopic eczema. There was no significant effect of the three allergic diseases on multiple sclerosis or of ARC and atopic eczema on myasthenia. Using ARM, allergic diseases clustered with multiple autoimmune disorders. Three age- and sex-related clusters were identified, with a relatively complex pattern in females ≥55 years old. Conclusions: The long-term risks of autoimmune disorders are significantly higher in patients with allergic diseases. Allergic diseases and autoimmune disorders show age- and sex-related clustering patterns.

Understanding genetic associations of specific patterns of symptoms might facilitate understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. Objective: To examine associations between allergic disease-related variants identified in a recent genome-wide association study and latent classes of allergic diseases (LCADs) in two population-based birth cohorts. Methods: Eight previously defined LCADs between birth and 11 years: “No disease,” “Atopic march,” “Persistent eczema and wheeze,” “Persistent eczema with later-onset rhinitis,” “Persistent wheeze with later-onset rhinitis,” “Transient wheeze,” “Eczema only” and “Rhinitis only” were used as the study outcome. Weighted multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate associations between 135 SNPs (and a polygenic risk score, PRS) and LCADs among 6345 individuals from The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Heterogeneity across LCADs was assessed before and after Bonferroni correction. Results were replicated in Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study (MAAS) (n = 896) and pooled in a meta-analysis. Results: We found strong evidence for differential genetic associations across the LCADs; pooled PRS heterogeneity P-value = 3.3 × 10−14, excluding “no disease” class. The associations between the PRS and LCADs in MAAS were remarkably similar to ALSPAC. Two SNPs (a protein-truncating variant in FLG and a SNP within an intron of GSDMB) had evidence for differential association (pooled P-values ≤ 0.006). The FLG locus was differentially associated across LCADs that included eczema, with stronger associations for LCADs with comorbid wheeze and rhinitis. The GSDMB locus in contrast was equally associated across LCADs that included wheeze. Conclusions and clinical relevance: We have shown complex, but distinct patterns of genetic associations with LCADs, suggesting that heterogeneous mechanisms underlie individual disease trajectories. Establishing the combination of allergic diseases with which each genetic variant is associated may inform therapeutic development and/or predictive modelling. © 2019 The Authors.

As most quality-of-life scales have been developed in English, there is a growing need to adapt them transculturally to obtain equivalence between the original instrument and the adapted scale. Objectives: To assess the construct and convergent–discriminant validity and responsiveness of the Colombian version of Skindex-29. Methods: The cross-sectional and longitudinal validity and responsiveness were tested in both healthy and dermatology patients. Construct validity was tested through a confirmatory factor analysis. The convergent–discriminant validity was assessed by examining the Spearman correlation coefficient. Change sensitivity was tested by means of the standardized response mean. The effect size and the minimum detectable change were also assessed. Results: A total of 265 participants were included; 21·1% were healthy individuals, and 78·9% patients had either inflammatory or noninflammatory skin diseases. Confirmatory factor analysis showed an adequate comparative fit index and Tucker–Lewis index adjustment for the root mean square error of approximation. Convergent validity showed moderate correlations between the emotions, functioning and physical function or physical role domains. Discriminant validity showed low correlations between overall domains for both scales. Sensitivity to change at the first and third month showed effect sizes in global Skindex scores of 0·92 and 0·82, respectively. Conclusions: The Colombian version of Skindex-29 is a valid and clinically sensitive instrument, which can be used for clinical practice and for research to measure the impact of skin diseases on the quality of life of dermatology patients. © 2019 British Association of Dermatologists",,"acne vulgaris; adult; aged; Article; atopic dermatitis; Colombian; confirmatory factor analysis; construct validity; controlled study; convergent validity; correlation coefficient; cross-sectional study; dermatitis; Dermatology Life Quality Index; discriminant validity; female; groups by age; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; minimum detectable change; non melanoma skin cancer; pigmented nevus; priority journal; prospective study; psoriasis; quality of life; Skindex 29; adolescent; Colombia; male; middle aged; normal human; patient-reported outcome; procedures; psychology; psychometry; publication; quality of life; reproducibility; skin disease; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Prospective Studies; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Skin Diseases; Translations; Young Adult",,,,,"Universidad de Antioquia, UdeA

Phenotype studies of allergic diseases can facilitate the identification of risk factors and their underlying pathophysiology, resulting in the application of more effective treatment, selection of better treatment responses, and prediction of prognosis for each phenotype. In the early phase of phenotype studies in allergic diseases, artificial classifications were usually performed based on clinical features, such as triggering factors or the presence of atopy, which can result in the biased classification of phenotypes and limit the characterization of heterogeneous allergic diseases. Subsequent phenotype studies have suggested more diverse phenotypes for each allergic disease using relatively unbiased statistical methods, such as cluster analysis or latent class analysis. The classifications of phenotypes in allergic diseases may overlap or be unstable over time due to their complex interactions with genetic and encountered environmental factors during the illness, which may affect the disease course and pathophysiology. In this review, diverse phenotype classifications of allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and wheezing in children, allergic rhinitis, and atopy, are described. The review also discusses the applications of the results obtained from phenotype studies performed in other countries to Korean children. Consideration of changes in the characteristics of each phenotype over time in an individual’s lifespan is needed in future studies. © 2019 by The Korean Pediatric Society.","Allergic diseases; Child; Phenotype; Sensitization","serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 5; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; cluster analysis; disease course; eczema; human; immunoregulation; phenotype; quality of life; Review; sensitization; wheezing",,,,,"Chonnam National University, CNU","This study was financially supported by Chonnam National University.",,,,"Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis 2.0: From the clinical phenotype to the molecular taxonomy and stratified medicine (2012) Allergy, 67, pp. 1475-1482; Giavina-Bianchi, P., Defining phenotypes in rhinitis: A step toward personalized medicine (2015) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 135, pp. 151-152; Bieber, T., D'erme, A.M., Akdis, C.A., Traidl-Hoffmann, C., Lauener, R., Schäppi, G., Clinical phenotypes and endophenotypes of atopic dermatitis: Where are we, and where should we go?

This study aims to identify allergic sensitization and morbidity patterns during the first 8 years of life. Methods: The study was conducted in the on-going population-based prospective Pollution and Asthma Risk: an Infant Study (PARIS) birth cohort. Sensitization profiles were identified by k-means clustering based upon allergen-specific IgE levels measured at 18 months and 8/9 years. Allergic morbidity profiles were identified by latent class analysis based on symptoms, symptom severity, treatments, and lifetime doctor-diagnoses of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis and on lower respiratory infections before 2 years. Results: Five sensitization and 5 allergic morbidity patterns were established in 714 children. Children not sensitized or with isolated and low allergen-specific sensitization were grouped together (76.8%). A profile of early and transient sensitization to foods that increased the risk of asthma later in childhood was identified (4.9%). Children strongly sensitized (≥3.5 kUA/L) to house dust mite at 8/9 years (9.0%) had the highest risk of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Finally, timothy grass pollen at 8/9 years sensitization profile (5.3%) was related to respiratory allergic diseases, as was early onset and persistent sensitization profile (4.1%), this latter being also strongly associated with atopic dermatitis. Conclusions &amp; Clinical Relevance: We show that accurate assessment of the risk of allergic disease should rely on earliness and multiplicity of sensitization, involved allergens, and allergen-specific IgE levels, and not considering solely allergic sensitization as a dichotomous variable (allergen-specific IgE ≥0.35 kUA/L), as usually done. This is particularly striking for house dust mite. We are hopeful that, pending further confirmation in other populations, our findings will improve clinical practice as part of an approach to allergic disease prevention. © 2019 The Authors","Allergic morbidity; Birth cohort; Cluster analysis; Latent class analysis; Specific IgE levels","house dust allergen; immunoglobulin E; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child; childhood; clinical practice; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; disease predisposition; disease severity; female; follow up; grass pollen; high risk population; human; lower respiratory tract infection; major clinical study; male; morbidity; Phleum pratense; population research; preventive medicine; priority journal; respiratory tract allergy; risk assessment; sensitization; symptom",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,"2015/1/082

Developing validated measurement tools is necessary to achieve this goal. In the field of dermatology, there are few studies related to empowerment of the patient. The aim of the present research is to develop and validate a self-administered questionnaire for adult patients diagnosed with atopic dermatitis (AD) in order to measure their level of empowerment. Methods: After a literature review and the establishment of consulting groups of patients and dermatologists, a large battery of 35 items was generated, based on the dimensions included in previous empowerment descriptions. A multidisciplinary group selected the 20 most suitable items to include in the questionnaire. A cross-sectional study was carried out with the items included in the questionnaire as well as demographic and clinical characteristics. To reduce the number of items and measure the construct validity, an exploratory factorial analysis (EFA) of the primary components and varimax rotation were used. Cronbach's α was used to measure the reliability of the individual scales and the global questionnaire. Results: 242 valid questionnaires were included. After completion of the EFA, the final Dermatitis Atópica EMPoderamiento (DATEMP) questionnaire was composed of 17 items that converged on four factors. The four scales had adequate reliability: “Knowledge” (Cronbach's alpha = 0.808), “Abilities” (Cronbach's alpha = 0.744), “Intention to change” (Cronbach's alpha = 0.798) and “Coping skills” (Cronbach's alpha = 0.772). The overall Cronbach's α of the questionnaire was 0.764. Conclusions: The DATEMP questionnaire is the first specific empowerment measurement instrument developed for patients with AD that has demonstrated adequate levels of reliability and construct validity. It is a self-administered questionnaire that is simple and quick to answer. © 2019 Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft (DDG).

Dermatology sicknesses incorporates normal skin rashes to serious skin contaminations, which happens because of scope of things, like diseases, warm, allergens, framework issue and drugs. First regular skin issue are dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis is relating current (perpetual) condition that causes eager, aroused skin. Most much of the time it appears as patches on the face, neck, trunk or appendages. It will in general erupt sporadically so die down for a period. A large portion of the dermatological sicknesses are not reparable but rather most the treatments depend on the administration of the side effects related with it. The focus of this research will be the Dermatology database. The problem is to determine the type of Eryhemato-Squamous disease like psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis and pityriasis rubra pilaris. The differential analysis of erythemato-squamous maladies is a genuine issue in dermatology. They all offer the clinical highlights of erythema and scaling, with next to no distinctions. Each pattern is a set of 33 numbers in the range linear values and one of them is nominal. The 80% of the dataset utilize for demonstrating and keep down 20% for approval. Objective is to accomplish best performer algorithm which will convey in dermatology informational collection so for this reason the gut feel recommends distance based calculations like k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines may progress admirably.

Objective: To elucidate the distribution of AD lesions and its impact on QOL in US adults with AD. Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based study of 602 adults was performed. AD was determined using modified UK Diagnostic Criteria, and its lesional distribution was assessed. QOL was assessed using Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to determine distinct phenotypes of AD lesional distribution. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between DLQI and distinct phenotypes. Results: The most common sites of skin lesions were reported to be the popliteal fossae, lower legs, dorsal feet and antecubital fossae. Most persons reported partial (19.0%) or complete (63.0%) symmetry of lesions on the extremities. Lesions on the trunk were significantly more common in blacks and Hispanics. Age ≥ 60 years was associated with significantly lower proportions of active lesions on the face and scalp, and significantly higher proportion of lesions on the buttocks or genitals. LCA identified 5 classes of lesional distribution: 1. lower probabilities of lesions affecting any sites; 2. Higher probability of lesions involving the anterior and posterior neck and trunk; 3. lesions involving the antecubital fossae and upper extremities; 4. lesions involving the arms, posterior hands, genitals and buttocks, and to a lesser extent face, palms and legs; 5. lesions affecting all sites. Class-2 (multivariable logistic regression; adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 7.19 [3.21–16.07], class-3 (7.11 [3.20–15.80]), class-4 (6.90 [3.07–15.50]) and class-5 (7.92 [3.54–17.71]) were all significantly associated with higher DLQI scores compared to class 1. Conclusion: AD is associated with heterogeneous distribution of AD lesions, and distinct phenotypes that are associated with QOL impact. © 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",,"adult; aged; aging; Article; atopic dermatitis; Black person; body regions; controlled study; cross-sectional study; Dermatology Life Quality Index; female; Hispanic; human; latent class analysis; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal; quality of life; skin disease; United States; very elderly",,,,,"Pfizer

However, blood phenotyping across these subsets is not yet available in patients with vitiligo. Objective: We sought to measure cytokine production by circulating skin-homing (CLA+) versus systemic (CLA−) “polar” CD4+/CD8+ ratio and activated T-cell subsets in patients with vitiligo compared with patients with AA, AD, or psoriasis and control subjects. Methods: Flow cytometry was used to measure levels of the cytokines IFN-γ, IL-13, IL-9, IL-17, and IL-22 in CD4+/CD8+ T cells in the blood of 19 patients with moderate-to-severe nonsegmental/generalized vitiligo, moderate-to-severe AA (n = 32), psoriasis (n = 24), or AD (n = 43) and control subjects (n = 30). Unsupervised clustering differentiated subjects into groups based on cellular frequencies. Results: Patients with Vitiligo showed the highest CLA+/CLA− TH1/type 1 cytotoxic T-cell polarization, with parallel TH2/TH9/TH17/TH22 level increases to levels often greater than those seen in patients with AA, AD, or psoriasis (P &lt; .05). Total regulatory T-cell counts were lower in patients with vitiligo than in control subjects and patients with AD or psoriasis (P &lt; .001). Vitiligo severity correlated with levels of multiple cytokines (P &lt; .1), whereas duration was linked with IFN-γ and IL-17 levels (P &lt; .04). Patients and control subjects grouped into separate clusters based on blood biomarkers. Conclusions: Vitiligo is characterized by a multicytokine polarization among circulating skin-homing and systemic subsets, which differentiates it from other inflammatory/autoimmune skin diseases. Future targeted therapies should delineate the relative contribution of each cytokine axis to disease perpetuation. © 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","alopecia areata; atopic dermatitis; biomarkers; endotypes; psoriasis; regulatory T; TH1; TH17; TH2; TH22; Vitiligo","cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen; gamma interferon; interleukin 13; interleukin 17; interleukin 22; interleukin 9; 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X; biological marker; cytokine; oligosaccharide; sialyl Lewis x antigen; adult; aged; allergic asthma; alopecia areata; Article; atopic dermatitis; autoimmune skin disease; blood group typing; CD4 CD8 ratio; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell isolation; clinical article; controlled study; cytokine production; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; dermatitis; differential diagnosis; disease severity; female; flow cytometry; human; lymphocyte count; male; phenotype; polarization; priority journal; psoriasis; regulatory T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; T lymphocyte subpopulation; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; Th2 cell; Th22 cell; Th9 cell; vitiligo; alopecia areata; atopic dermatitis; blood; disease exacerbation; immunology; inflammation; metabolism; middle aged; skin; very elderly; vitiligo; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alopecia Areata; Biomarkers; Cytokines; Dermatitis, Atopic; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Progression; Female; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Middle Aged; Oligosaccharides; Sialyl Lewis X Antigen; Skin; Th1 Cells; Th2 Cells; Vitiligo",,"gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; interleukin 22, 457106-70-6, 478219-35-1, 554460-75-2; 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X; Biomarkers; Cytokines; Oligosaccharides; Sialyl Lewis X Antigen",,,"MedImmune

Atopy might reflect various conditions differing in their susceptibility to environmental factors. Objective: We sought to define phenotypes of atopic sensitization in early childhood and examine their association with allergic diseases and hereditary background in Finland and Estonia. Methods: The analysis included 1603 Finnish and 1657 Estonian children from the DIABIMMUNE multicenter young children cohort. Specific IgE levels were measured at age 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, and categorized into 3 CAP classes. Latent class analysis was performed with the statistical software package poLCA in R software. Results: Both populations differed in terms of socioeconomic status and environmental determinants, such as pet ownership, farm-related exposure, time spent playing outdoors, and prevalence of allergic diseases (all P <.001). Nevertheless, we found similar latent classes in both populations: an unsensitized class, a food class, 2 inhalant classes differentiating between seasonal and perennial aeroallergens, and a severe atopy class. The latter was characterized by high total and specific IgE levels and strongly associated with wheeze (odds ratio [OR], 5.64 [95% CI, 3.07-10.52] and 4.56 [95% CI, 2.35-8.52]), allergic rhinitis (OR, 22.4 [95% CI, 11.67-44.54] and 13.97 [95% CI, 7.33-26.4]), and atopic eczema (OR, 9.39 [95% CI, 4.9-19.3] and 9.5 [95% CI, 5.2-17.5] for Finland and Estonia, respectively). Environmental differences were reflected in the larger seasonal inhalant atopy class in Finland, although composition of classes was comparable between countries. Conclusion: Despite profound differences in environmental exposures, there might exist genuine patterns of atopic sensitization. The distribution of these patterns might determine the contribution of atopic sensitization to disease onset. © 2019 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","allergy; atopy; diabetes type 1 risk; Estonia; Finland; IgE; Latent class analysis; severe atopy; unsupervised clustering; wheezing","immunoglobulin E; allergen; immunoglobulin E; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; Article; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; disease association; eczema; environmental exposure; Estonia; female; Finland; human; latent class analysis; major clinical study; male; pet animal; preschool child; prevalence; priority journal; sensitization; social status; wheezing; air pollutant; blood; clinical trial; cohort analysis; immediate type hypersensitivity; immunization; immunology; lifestyle; multicenter study; phenotype; pollen; season; socioeconomics; Air Pollutants; Allergens; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Estonia; Female; Finland; Humans; Hypersensitivity, Immediate; Immunization; Immunoglobulin E; Life Style; Male; Phenotype; Pollen; Prevalence; Seasons; Socioeconomic Factors",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Air Pollutants; Allergens; Immunoglobulin E",,,"Helsingin Yliopisto

The clinical course and treatment for atopic dermatitis can differ according to its phenotype and/or endotype. This study aimed to identify clinical phenotypes of atopic dermatitis in early childhood. Data were obtained from 572 children under 3 years of age with atopic dermatitis. Cluster analysis applied to 11 variables, and we identified four clusters of atopic dermatitis. Children in cluster A (n = 141) had early-onset atopic dermatitis with high blood eosinophil counts, serum total immunoglobulin E and rates of sensitization to food allergens. Children in cluster B (n = 218) had early-onset atopic dermatitis with low blood eosinophil counts, serum total immunoglobulin E and rates of sensitization to both food and inhalant allergens. Children in cluster C (n = 53) had early-onset atopic dermatitis with high C-reactive protein levels and white blood cell counts. Children in cluster D (n = 160) had middle-onset atopic dermatitis with high serum total immunoglobulin E and rates of sensitization to inhalant allergens. Cluster A had the highest Scoring for Atopic Dermatitis and transepidermal water loss values. Age at onset, age at diagnosis, white blood cell count, eosinophil count, C-reactive protein and serum total immunoglobulin E level were the strongest predictors of cluster assignment. Analysis of these six variables alone resulted in correct classification of 95.5% of the subjects. These results support the heterogeneity of atopic dermatitis, even in early childhood. © 2018 Japanese Dermatological Association","atopic dermatitis; child, preschool; cluster analysis; infant; phenotype","C reactive protein; food allergen; immunoglobulin E; Article; atopic dermatitis; child; childhood; cluster analysis; disease classification; disease severity; eosinophil count; female; human; immunoglobulin blood level; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; onset age; phenotype; protein blood level; skin water loss; atopic dermatitis; classification; infant; phenotype; South Korea; Cluster Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Phenotype; Republic of Korea",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,"W17-442","This research was financially supported by a grant from Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital (no.

It has a high prevalence worldwide and affected persons are prone to recurrent attacks, seriously affecting the physical and mental of patients. The exact etiology of the disease is still unclear. Material/Methods: There are 7 datasets on atopic dermatitis in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 142 lesional and 134 non-lesional skin biopsy samples. Differential analysis was performed after datasets were integrated by robust multi-array average method. Functional modules of GSE99802 were explored by weighted gene coexpression network analysis. The 4 most important modules were enriched into the pathways by Metascape. Results: Significantly differentially expressed genes included 41 upregulated and 10 downregulated genes. The following 5 of the most important upregulated genes had the strongest association with atopic dermatitis. SERPINB3and4 promote inflammation and impaired skin barrier function in the early stage of atopic dermatitis. S100A9 aggravates the inflammatory response by inducing the activation of toll-like receptor 4, neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophilic inflammation, and the amplification of interleukin-8. MMP1 is the key protease of skin collagen degradation, keeping the extracellular matrix in dynamic balance. MMP12 induces the aggregation of various inflammatory cells into inflammatory tissue. The enriched pathways of each module mainly include Cellular responses to external stimuli, Metabolism of RNA and Translation, and Infectious disease.

Mechanisms for developing atopic comorbidities after AD onset are poorly understood but can involve the impaired cutaneous barrier, which facilitates cutaneous sensitization. The association can also be driven or amplified in susceptible subjects by a systemic TH2-dominant immune response to cutaneous inflammation. However, these associations might merely involve shared genetic loci and environmental triggers, including microbiome dysregulation, with the temporal sequence reflecting tissue-specific peak time of occurrence of each disease, suggesting more of a clustering of disorders than a march. Prospective longitudinal cohort studies provide an opportunity to explore the relationships between postdermatitis development of atopic disorders and potential predictive phenotypic, genotypic, and environmental factors. Recent investigations implicate disease severity and persistence, age of onset, parental atopic history, filaggrin (FLG) mutations, polysensitization, and the nonrural environment among risk factors for development of multiple atopic comorbidities in young children with AD. Early intervention studies to repair the epidermal barrier or alter exposure to the microbiome or allergens might elucidate the relative roles of barrier defects, genetic locus alterations, and environmental exposures in the risk and sequence of occurrence of TH2 activation disorders. © 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","allergic rhinitis;

This study aimed to determine the gene expression pattern and pathways related to severe asthma and subsequently identify potential predictor for steroid-resistant asthma. Peripheral blood B lymphocytes were isolated from subjects with severe steroid-resistant (n=7) and severe steroid-dependent (n=7) asthma. Total RNA was extracted from the B lymphocytes and subjected to microarray experiment. Data were analyzed using GeneSpring GX software for differential gene expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to analyze disease pathways. The prediction model was generated using Prophet software and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to validate the microarray gene expression. 307 genes were differentially expressed between both groups with p<0.001 using unpaired t-test. Six genes were selected as steroid-resistant predictor based on a particular selection criteria. Class predictors were identified with a predictive accuracy of 93%. This study has provided a better insight into the expression pattern and pathways of severe asthma and provided potential prognosis biomarkers to discriminate between severe steroid-resistant and steroid-sensitive asthma. © 2018 Pharmascope Publications.

Our study aimed to assess the reliability, validity, and measurement invariance of DLQI in a homogeneous population with arsenic-related skin lesions and symptoms. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in communities under lifetime arsenic exposure. The DLQI was measured through a face-to-face interview. Skin examinations were performed by certificated dermatologists. The intensity of itching was measured by a numerical rating scale. Reliability, structural validity, and measurement invariance were determined using classical and modern test theories, including confirmatory factor analysis and item response models. Results: 465 participants with arsenic-related skin lesions and symptoms completed the DLQI assessment. The Cronbach’s alpha was 0.79, and the split-half reliability was 0.77. A two-factor model exhibited the best model fit among models evaluated, but local dependencies among items were identified. The model showed good root mean square error of approximation (0.031) and acceptable Tucker–Lewis index (0.92). Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis showed no measurement invariance across subgroups of age, gender, ethnicity, and intensity of itching. Conclusions: The DLQI had acceptable psychometric properties, but measurement invariance was not observed across different groups of participants. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Arsenic exposure;

We investigated 186 children who were followed-up regularly for 4 years in a birth cohort study. The levels of Th2 related chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (CCL17) and CCL22 were quantified in cord blood and at 1.5 years-of-age using multiplex Luminex kits. The levels of 125 pairs of CCL17 and CCL22 chemokines from birth to 1.5 years were recorded in this study. Using K-means clustering, only the declining trend of CCL22 levels was separately clustered (cluster A, n = 51; cluster B, n = 46; cluster C, n = 28). Mothers of children with higher CCL22 chemokine levels at birth were significantly more likely to display Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus sensitization. A lower CCL22 level at birth with a slight rise during infancy was associated with higher prevalence of mite sensitization and a higher risk of asthma at 3 years-of-age (P = 0.014). In conclusion, low mother-to-child Th2-associated chemokine CCL22 levels appear to be inversely related to mite sensitization and the risk of asthma development in early childhood. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"CCL17 protein, human; CCL22 protein, human; immunoglobulin E; macrophage derived chemokine; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; animal; asthma; atopic dermatitis; blood; Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; female; follow up; human; immunology; infant; male; preschool child; risk factor; Th2 cell; Animals; Asthma; Chemokine CCL17; Chemokine CCL22; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Infant; Male; Risk Factors; Th2 Cells",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; thymus and activation regulated chemokine, 181532-29-6; CCL17 protein, human; CCL22 protein, human; Chemokine CCL17; Chemokine CCL22; Immunoglobulin E",,,"Chang Gung Medical Foundation

Furthermore, reports of prevalence of NAR in Chinese subjects are scarce. Thus, we aimed to explore the prevalence and risk factors of AR and NAR in a Chinese, based on both clinical manifestation and allergic status. Methods: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey, involving 1084 local residents from a rural area of Beijing, China. Participants were enrolled using a stratified two-stage cluster sampling method. All adult participants or the guardians of children completed standardized questionnaires to provide relevant demographic and clinical information. Skin prick tests were also performed to determine sensitization to specific aeroallergens. AR/NAR was classified according to Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma criteria. Results: Prevalence of self-reported AR was 46.80%. Based on SPT results, the confirmed standardized prevalence of AR and NAR were 16.78% and 24.60%, respectively. Severity scores for nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea and congestion were significantly higher in subjects with AR, than subjects with NAR (P < 0.05 for all). The three most common aeroallergens in self-reported AR group were Blattella germanica (16.6%), Dermatophagoides farinae (14.6%), and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (13.9%). Family history of AR and atopic dermatitis were significantly associated with AR (adjusted OR: 4.97 and 2.69, respectively), whereas family history of AR and asthma were significantly associated with NAR (adjusted OR: 3.53 and 2.45, respectively). Similarly, comorbid asthma, CRS, and atopic dermatitis were significant risk factors for both AR and NAR. Conclusions: Combination of standardized questionnaires and specific allergen tests may provide more accurate estimates of prevalence of AR and NAR and associated risk factors. © 2018 The Author(s).","Allergic rhinitis; Atopic status; Epidemiologic study; Nonallergic rhinitis","aeroallergen; allergen; unclassified drug; adolescent; adult; allergic rhinitis; Article; Asthma criteria; atopic dermatitis; Blattella germanica; China; Chinese; chronic rhinosinusitis; clinical assessment tool; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; cluster analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; Dermatophagoides farinae; Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; disease association; disease classification; disease severity; family history; female; human; immunopathogenesis; major clinical study; male; medical information; middle aged; nasal pruritus; nonhuman; nose obstruction; population based case control study; prevalence; prick test; questionnaire; rhinorrhea; risk factor; rural area; scoring system; self report; sensitization; sneezing; species difference; vasomotor rhinitis",,,,,"SML20150203

The relation between AD severity and disease comorbidities is complex and not fully understood. Objective: To determine the complex relation between AD severity and comorbidities. Methods: A cross-sectional US population-based study of 8,217 adults who were participants in a nationally representative internet health panel was performed using a structured questionnaire. A diagnosis of AD was determined using modified United Kingdom Working Party Criteria for AD (n = 602). AD severity was assessed using Patient-Oriented Scoring AD, Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, Dermatology Life Quality Index, and self-reported global AD severity. Logistic regression and structural equation models were used to explore associations of AD with self-reported allergic, cardiometabolic, anxiety and depression, and autoimmune disease. Results: In multivariable regression models controlling for sociodemographics, AD was associated with higher odds of asthma (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71–2.55), hay fever (OR 4.31, 95% CI 3.27–5.69), food allergy (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.54–2.77), anxiety and depression (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.91–2.87), autoimmune disease (OR 3.05, 95% CI 2.31–4.03), obesity (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.13–1.67), diabetes (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.16–1.99), high blood pressure (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.18–1.80), and heart disease (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.40–2.70) compared with controls (P <.01 for all). All these associations were significant in mild and/or moderate disease, with even stronger effects in severe AD. Results of structural equation models showed direct effects of moderate to severe AD on food allergy, anxiety and depression, and diabetes, direct and indirect effects on obesity, and indirect effects on high blood pressure and heart disease. Conclusion: There is a strong relation of AD severity to allergic, autoimmune, and cardiovascular comorbidities. © 2018 The Authors",,"adult; allergy; American; anxiety disorder; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; autoimmune disease; cardiovascular disease; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; depression; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease severity; eczema; female; food allergy; heart disease; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; obesity; pollen allergy; priority journal; quality of life; scoring system; self report",,,,,,"We thank Eugene Semenov for his assistance with structural equation models.",,,,"Silverberg, J.I., Gelfand, J.M., Margolis, D.J., Patient-burden and quality of life in atopic dermatitis in US adults: a population-based cross-sectional study [published online ahead of print July 6, 2018].

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between incidences of infantile eczema in children under 2 years of age and urban outdoor environmental factors. Methods: A 11-year population-based study was conducted in retrospective design. The age/gender-adjusted incidence rates of infantile eczema were determined using the data of outpatient visits. We analysed 1965 cases with atopic dermatitis including infantile eczema in relation to the annual means of outdoor monitoring data from 2005 through 2015 in Minsk. Logistic regression and principal component analysis were performed to determine association between the annual means of air pollutants, meteorological variables and incidences of infantile eczema. Results: Higher mean annual carbon monoxide, ammonia, formaldehyde, lead, particulate matter and ground-level ozone were associated with high incidence rates of infantile eczema both in boys and girls. Higher nitrogen dioxide was associated with high incidence rates of infantile eczema in girls 1–2 years of age and boys 0–2 years of age. There were identified by principal component analysis five combinations of pollutants and meteorological factors. High incidence rates of infantile eczema were associated with the combinations contained higher levels of air pollutants and ultraviolet index, or lower β-activity of the radionuclide-associated aerosols. The higher phenol and formaldehyde levels the higher incidence rates of infantile eczema were observed among boys 0–1 years of age and girls 1–2 years of age. The higher total column ozone with lower lead level was associated with low incidence rates of infantile eczema among boys and girls 1–2 years of age. Conclusion: Urban outdoor air pollutants and their combination with meteorological conditions may impact onset of infantile eczema in both genders. © 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",,"ammonia; carbon monoxide; formaldehyde; lead; nitrogen dioxide; radioisotope; ozone; radioisotope; aerosol; age distribution; air pollution; Article; atopic dermatitis; child; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; female; human; humidity; incidence; infant; major clinical study; male; meteorological phenomena; onset age; ozone layer; particulate matter; population research; preschool child; priority journal; sex difference; ultraviolet radiation; urban area; aerosol; air pollutant; atopic dermatitis; Belarus; chemistry; cohort analysis; confidence interval; environmental exposure; newborn; odds ratio; pathophysiology; retrospective study; risk assessment; statistical model; urban population; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Confidence Intervals; Dermatitis, Atopic; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Male; Odds Ratio; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Radioisotopes; Republic of Belarus; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Urban Population",,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; formaldehyde, 50-00-0; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; ozone, 10028-15-6; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Radioisotopes",,,,,,,,"Wadonda-Kabondo, N., Sterne, J.A., Golding, J., A prospective study of the prevalence and incidence of atopic dermatitis in children aged 0–42 months (2003) Br J Dermatol, 149, pp. 1023-1028; Ben-Gashir, M.A., Seed, P.T., Hay, R.J., Predictors of atopic dermatitis severity over time (2004) J Am Acad Dermatol, 50, pp. 349-356; Ahn, K., The role of air pollutants in atopic dermatitis (2014) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 134, pp. 993-999; Flohr, C., Mann, J., New insights into the epidemiology of childhood atopic dermatitis (2014) Allergy, 69, pp. 3-16; Huss-Marp, J., Eberlein-König, B., Breuer, K., Influence of short-term exposure to airborne Der p 1 and volatile organic compounds on skin barrier function and dermal blood flow in patients with atopic eczema and healthy individuals (2006) Clin Exp Allergy, 36, pp. 338-345; Morgenstern, V., Zutavern, A., Cyrys, J., Atopic diseases, allergic sensitization, and exposure to traffic-related air pollution in children (2008) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 177, pp. 1331-1337; Eller, E., Kjaer, H.F., Høst, A., Andersen, K.E., Bindslev-Jensen, C., Development of atopic dermatitis in the DARC birth cohort (2010) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 21 (2), pp. 307-314; Ballardini, N., Bergström, A., Böhme, M., Infantile eczema: prognosis and risk of asthma and rhinitis in preadolescence (2014) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 133, pp. 594-596; Kramer, U., Sugiri, D., Ranft, U., Eczema, respiratory allergies, and traffic-related air pollution in birth cohorts from small-town areas (2009) J Dermatol Sci, 56, pp. 99-105; Kathuria, P., Silverberg, J.I., Association of pollution and climate with atopic eczema in US children (2016) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 27, pp. 478-485; Sultz, H.A., Feldman, J.G., Schlesinger, E.R., Mosher, W.E., An effect of continued exposure to air pollution on the incidence of chronic childhood allergic disease (1970) Am J Public Health Nations Health, 60, pp. 891-900; Jedrychowski, W., Perera, F., Maugeri, U., Effects of prenatal and perinatal exposure to fine air pollutants and maternal fish consumption on the occurrence of infantile eczema (2011) Int Arch Allergy Immunol, 155, pp. 275-281; (2008) Ministry of Health of the Republic of Belarus, , http://minzdrav.gov.by/en/dlya-spetsialistov/standarty-obsledovaniya-i-lecheniya/2008-god.php, The clinical protocol for diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis of atopic dermatitis., (last accessed 8 April 2018); Hanifin, J.M., Rajka, G., Diagnostic features of atopic dermatitis (1980) Acta Derm Venereol, 92, pp. 44-47; Population by sex and age of the Republic of Belarus, , http://minsk-city.belstat.gov.by/ofitsialnaya-statistika/publications/public_compilation/index_6458, Statistical Bulletin, Minsk-City.

Disorder in stratum corneum is related with many skin diseases including acne, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. In developed countries, about 20% of the population has disorder in the barrier function of stratum corneum. Adhesive tape stripping is a method to disrupt skin barrier function in studying disorder in stratum corneum. In this study, we obtained NIR (Near-Infrared) spectrum of human skin after tape stripping. Changes in skin spectra after barrier disruption were investigated through principal component analysis (PCA) of spectrum. PCA analysis revealed that peaks for -NH stretching and -CH vibration mainly contributed to the spectral variation caused by barrier disruption. Furthermore, second derivative of spectrum revealed that acute barrier disruption contributes to spectral changes in the region related with secondary structure of protein, lipid and water associated with lipid in stratum corneum. We demonstrated that acute barrier disruption affected features in NIR spectrum. These spectral changes revealed that acute barrier disruption affected keratin protein and ceramide in human stratum corneum. These results suggest that NIR spectroscopy can be used to monitor changes in filamentous network and lamellar structure in stratum corneum. NIR spectroscopy can provide non-invasive method to investigate skin disease related with barrier disruption by monitoring disturbance in protein and lipid structure in stratum corneum. © 2018 IEEE.",,"lipid; protein; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; epidermis; human; near infrared spectroscopy; pathology; skin; skin disease; Epidermis; Humans; Lipids; Proteins; Skin; Skin Diseases; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",,"lipid, 66455-18-3; protein, 67254-75-5; Lipids; Proteins",,,,,,,,"Levin, J., Friedlander, S.F., Del Rosso, J.Q., Atopic dermatitis and the stratum corneum: Part 2: Other structural and functional characteristics of the stratum corneum barrier in atopic skin (2013) THE JOURNAL of CLINICAL and AESTHETIC DERMATOLOGY, 6, pp. 49-54. , NOV; Jordan, L., Baldwin, H.E., Stratum corneum abnormalities and disease-affected skin: Strategies for successful outcomes in inflammatory acne (2016) JOURNAL of DRUGS in DERMATOLOGY: JDD, 15, pp. 1170-1173. , OCT 1; Egawa, G., Kabashima, K., Multifactorial skin barrier deficiency and atopic dermatitis: Essential topics to prevent the atopic March (2016) JOURNAL of ALLERGY and CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY, 138, pp. 350-358. , E1, 2016/08/01/; Van Smeden, J., Janssens, M., Gooris, G.S., Bouwstra, J.A., The important role of stratum corneum lipids for the cutaneous barrier function (2014) BIOCHIMICA et BIOPHYSICA ACTA (BBA)-MOLECULAR and CELL BIOLOGY of LIPIDS, 1841, pp. 295-313. , 2014/03/01/; Weidinger, S., Novak, N., Atopic dermatitis (2016) THE LANCET, 387, pp. 1109-1122. , 2016/03/12/; Gao, Y., Wang, X., Chen, S., Li, S., Liu, X., Acute skin barrier disruption with repeated tape stripping: An in vivo model for damage skin barrier (2013) SKIN RESEARCH and TECHNOLOGY: OFFICIAL JOURNAL of INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY for BIOENGINEERING and the SKIN, 19, pp. 162-168. , MAY; Qassem, M., Kyriacou, P.A., Reflectance near-infrared measurements for determining changes in skin barrier function and scattering in relation to moisturizer application (2015) JOURNAL of BIOMEDICAL OPTICS, 20, p. 095008. , SEP; Gorcea, M., Hadgraft, J., Lane, M.E., Moore, D.J., In vivo barrier challenge and long-term recovery in human facial skin (2013) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL of COSMETIC SCIENCE, 35, pp. 250-256. , JUN; Miyamae, Y., Yamakawa, Y., Kawabata, M., Ozaki, Y., A noninvasive method for assessing interior skin damage caused by chronological aging and photoaging based on near-infrared diffuse reflection spectroscopy (2008) APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY, 62, pp. 677-681. , JUN; Miyamae, Y., Kawabata, M., Yamakawa, Y., Tsuchiya, J., Ozaki, Y., Non-invasive estimation of skin thickness by near infrared diffuse reflection spectroscopy-separate determination of epidermis and dermis thickness (2012) JOURNAL of NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY, 20, pp. 617-622. , 2012/12/01; Miyazawa, M., Sonoyama, M., Second derivative near infrared studies on the structural characterisation of proteins (1998) JOURNAL of NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY, 6, pp. A253-A257. , 1998/01/01; Norlén, L., Stratum corneum keratin structure, function and formation-a comprehensive review (2006) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL of COSMETIC SCIENCE, 28, pp. 397-425; Narangifard, A., Den Hollander, L., Wennberg, C.L., Lundborg, M., Lindahl, E., Iwai, I., Han, H., Norlén, L., Human skin barrier formation takes place via a cubic to lamellar lipid phase transition as analyzed by cryo-electron microscopy and em-simulation (2018) EXPERIMENTAL CELL RESEARCH, 366, pp. 139-151. , 2018/05/15/; Martin, K., In vivo measurements of water in skin by near-infrared reflectance (1998) APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY, 52, pp. 1001-1007. , 1998/07/01; Horita, D., Hatta, I., Yoshimoto, M., Kitao, Y., Todo, H., Sugibayashi, K., Molecular mechanisms of action of different concentrations of ethanol in water on ordered structures of intercellular lipids and soft keratin in the stratum corneum (2015) BIOCHIMICA et BIOPHYSICA ACTA (BBA)-BIOMEMBRANES, 1848, pp. 1196-1202. , 2015/05/01/; Tagami, H., Electrical measurement of the hydration state of the skin surface in vivo (2014) BRITISH JOURNAL of DERMATOLOGY, 171, pp. 29-33",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, EMBC 2018","18 July 2018 through 21 July 2018",,141674,1557170X,9781538636466,,"30440687","English","Proc.

Similarly, not all atopic individuals develop wheeze, and vice versa. The reasons for these differences are unclear. Using unsupervised model-based cluster analysis, we identified latent clusters within a prospective birth cohort with deep immunological and respiratory phenotyping. We characterised each cluster in terms of immunological profile and disease risk, and replicated our results in external cohorts from the UK and USA. We discovered three distinct trajectories, one of which is a high-risk ‘atopic’ cluster with increased propensity for allergic diseases throughout childhood. Atopy contributes varyingly to later wheeze depending on cluster membership. Our findings demonstrate the utility of unsupervised analysis in elucidating heterogeneity in asthma pathogenesis and provide a foundation for improving management and prevention of childhood asthma. © Tang et al.",,"immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G4; interleukin 13; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; algorithm; allergic disease; allergy; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; body mass; child; child health; childhood disease; cluster analysis; controlled study; eczema; female; food allergy; genetic heterogeneity; Haemophilus; human; hypersensitivity; immune response; immunity; infant; lower respiratory tract infection; male; Moraxella; nasopharyngeal aspiration; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; phenotype; prick test; principal component analysis; protein expression; questionnaire; respiratory tract infection; rhinopharyngitis; risk factor; Streptococcus; upper respiratory tract infection; wheezing; asthma; Australia; growth, development and aging; hypersensitivity; immune system; immunology; pathophysiology; preschool child; respiratory system; Asthma; Australia; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immune System; Infant; Male; Respiratory System; Risk Factors",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0",,,"Medical Research Council, MRC: G0601361, MR/K002449/1, MR/L003120/1, MR/M015181/1",,,,,"Aalberse, R., The role of IgG antibodies in allergy and immunotherapy (2011) Allergy, 66, pp. 28-30; Almqvist, C., Worm, M., Leynaert, B., Impact of gender on asthma in childhood and adolescence: A GA2LEN review (2008) Allergy, 63, pp. 47-57. , working group of GA2LEN WP 2.5 Gender; Anderson, G.P., Endotyping asthma: New insights into key pathogenic mechanisms in a complex, heterogeneous disease (2008) The Lancet, 372, pp. 1107-1119; Ballardini, N., Nilsson, C., Nilsson, M., Lilja, G., ImmunoCAP Phadiatop Infant–a new blood test for detecting IgE sensitisation in children at 2 years of age (2006) Allergy, 61, pp. 337-343. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2005.00936.x, 16436143; Bantz, S.K., Zhu, Z., Zheng, T., The atopic march: Progression from atopic dermatitis to allergic rhinitis and asthma (2014) Journal of Clinical & Cellular Immunology, 5, pp. 67-73. , https://doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000202; Belgrave, D.C.M., Simpson, A., Semic-Jusufagic, A., Murray, C.S., Buchan, I., Pickles, A., Custovic, A., Joint modeling of parentally reported and physician-confirmed wheeze identifies children with persistent troublesome wheezing (2013) Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 132, pp. 575-583. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2013.05.041, 23906378; Belgrave, D.C., Granell, R., Simpson, A., Guiver, J., Bishop, C., Buchan, I., Henderson, A.J., Custovic, A., Developmental profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis: Two population-based birth cohort studies (2014) Plos Medicine, 11. , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001748, 25335105; Benaglia, T., Chauveau, D., Hunter, D.R., Young, D.S., Mixtools: An R package for analyzing mixture models (2009) Journal of Statistical Software, 32; Benaglia, T., Chauveau, D., Hunter, D.R., An EM-Like Algorithm for Semi-and Nonparametric Estimation in Multivariate Mixtures (2009) Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 18, pp. 505-526. , https://doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07175; Benjamini, Y., Yekutieli, D., The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency (2001) The Annals of Statistics, 29, pp. 1165-1188; Bisgaard, H., Hermansen, M.N., Buchvald, F., Loland, L., Halkjaer, L.B., Bønnelykke, K., Brasholt, M., Pipper, C.B., Childhood asthma after bacterial colonization of the airway in neonates (2007) New England Journal of Medicine, 357, pp. 1487-1495. , https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa052632, 17928596; Bousquet, J., Anto, J.M., Wickman, M., Keil, T., Valenta, R., Haahtela, T., Lodrup Carlsen, K., Gehrig, U., Are allergic multimorbidities and IgE polysensitization associated with the persistence or re-occurrence of foetal type 2 signalling?

However, little has been reported concerning the ear canal microbiota despite the fact that otitis externa is a common problem in dogs with cAD. Hypothesis/objectives: The study evaluated the ear canal microbiota of healthy dogs and atopic dogs without clinical signs of otitis. Animals: Nine healthy privately owned dogs and 11 dogs with a diagnosis of cAD. Methods and materials: Ear swabs from the two groups were used for global bacterial DNA extraction. V1–V3 hypervariable 16S rDNA amplicon libraries were prepared for each sample and sequenced with MiSeq Illumina sequence (V3 kit). Taxonomical assignment and clustering were performed with Mothur using SILVA database. Results: The ear canal microbiota showed changes in diversity similar to those reported for canine skin and seemed to be stable during the period of the study (28 days). Evidence of dysbiosis was observed in the atopic dogs, with increased abundance of Staphylococcus spp. and Ralstonia spp. (P < 0.05). Escherichia spp. also were found to be more abundant in healthy dogs. Conclusions and clinical importance: This study demonstrated a shift in bacterial populations between allergic and healthy dogs. The observed results in the ear canal are similar to those reported on the skin and could explain the propensity of allergic dogs to develop bacterial otitis. © 2018 ESVD and ACVD",,"bacterial DNA; cyclosporine;

Treatment often includes emollient bath additives, despite there being little evidence of their effectiveness. Objectives: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of emollient bath additives in the management of childhood eczema. Design: Pragmatic, randomised, open-label, multicentre superiority trial with two parallel groups. Setting: Ninety-six general practices in Wales, the west of England and southern England. Invitation by personal letter or opportunistically. Participants: Children aged between 12 months and 12 years fulfilling the UK Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Eczema. Children with inactive or very mild eczema (a score of ≤ 5 on the Nottingham Eczema Severity Scale) were excluded, as were children who bathed less than once per week or whose parents/ carers were not prepared to accept randomisation. Interventions: The intervention group were prescribed bath additives by their usual clinical team and were asked to use them regularly for 12 months. The control group were asked to use no bath additives for 12 months. Both groups continued standard eczema management, including regular leave-on emollients and topical corticosteroids (TCSs) when required. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was eczema control measured by Patient Oriented Eczema Measure [POEM, 0 (clear) to 28 (severe)] weekly for 16 weeks. The secondary outcomes were eczema severity over 1 year (4-weekly POEM), number of eczema exacerbations, disease-specific quality of life (QoL) (Dermatitis Family Impact Questionnaire), generic QoL (Child Health Utility-9 Dimensions) and type and quantity of topical steroid/calcineurin inhibitors prescribed. Children were randomised (1: 1) using online software to either bath additives plus standard eczema care or standard eczema care alone, stratified by recruiting centre, and there was open-label blinding. Results: From December 2014 to May 2016, 482 children were randomised: 51% were female, 84% were white and the mean age was 5 years (n = 264 in the intervention group, n = 218 in the control group). Reported adherence to randomised treatment allocation was > 92% in both groups, with 76.7% of participants completing at least 12 (80%) of the first 16 weekly questionnaires for the primary outcome. Baseline POEM score was 9.5 [standard deviation (SD) 5.7] in the bath additives group and 10.1 (SD 5.8) in the no bath additives group. Average POEM score over the first 16 weeks was 7.5 (SD 6.0) in the bath additives group and 8.4 (SD 6.0) in the no bath additives group, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. After controlling for baseline severity and confounders (ethnicity, TCS use, soap substitute use) and allowing for clustering of participants within centres and responses within participants over time, POEM scores in the no bath additive group were 0.41 points higher than in the bath additive group (95% confidence interval –0.27 to 1.10), which is well below the published minimal clinically important difference of 3 points. There was no difference between groups in secondary outcomes or in adverse effects such as redness, stinging or slipping. Limitations: Simple randomisation resulted in an imbalance in baseline group size, although baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. Conclusion: This trial found no evidence of clinical benefit of including emollient bath additives in the standard management of childhood eczema. Future work: Further research is required on optimal regimens of leave-on emollients and the use of emollients as soap substitutes. © Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.",,"calcium channel blocking agent; corticosteroid derivative; emollient agent; calcineurin inhibitor; corticosteroid; emollient agent; age distribution; Article; atopic dermatitis; Caucasian; Child Health Utility 9 Dimensions; childhood disease; clinical effectiveness; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; Dermatitis Family Impact Questionnaire; disease severity assessment; economic evaluation; eczema; England; ethnicity; health economics; human; injection site stinging; multicenter study (topic); Nottingham Eczema Severity Scale; open study; parallel design; patient compliance; Patient Oriented Eczema Measure score; pragmatic trial; prescription; quality of life assessment; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial (topic); scoring system; sex ratio; skin redness; treatment outcome; United Kingdom; Wales; bath; child; clinical trial; controlled study; economics; eczema; female; health care cost; health care planning; infant; male; medication compliance; multicenter study; preschool child; procedures; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; severity of illness index; statistics and numerical data; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Baths; Calcineurin Inhibitors; Child; Child, Preschool; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Eczema; Emollients; Female; Health Expenditures; Health Resources; Humans; Infant; Male; Medication Adherence; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; United Kingdom",,"Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Calcineurin Inhibitors; Emollients",,,"National Institute for Health Research, NIHR

The heterogeneity of AD is now broadly accepted, but there is no consensus on what the best approach is to disaggregate this complex condition, and how best to identify different AD endotypes. One approach is to use data-driven techniques to uncover the unobserved (ie latent) structure in the data set(s) to identify homogenous groups of individuals in the heterogeneous AD population. Since AD usually starts early in life, and its clinical features may progress, remit or relapse over time, analyses assessing trajectories related to their presence or absence over time may help us understand AD heterogeneity. However, studies that used unsupervised methods such as latent class analysis to discover AD ‘phenotypes’ have reported inconsistent findings. If we are to use data-driven analyses to uncover patterns of AD with different long-term consequences, then the discovered ‘phenotypes’ must be consistent and reproducible. We therefore need to understand the reasons for the inconsistencies between different studies. We suggest that in addition to capturing a simple presence or absence of symptoms, more detailed clinical features, such as the severity and medication used, should be assessed in longitudinal studies. Ultimately, the objective is to move from ‘deep phenotyping’ to more informative genetic studies, followed by functional studies to understand mechanisms.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of this intervention in Singapore. METHODS Modelling techniques were used to simulate, from birth to Month 30, the incidence and clinical/economic burden of AD in high-risk, non-exclusively breastfed infants fed with PHF-W or CMF for up to four months. Epidemiologic and clinical data were from a local comparative trial. Expert opinion informed AD treatment patterns and outcomes. Outcomes included reduction in AD risk, time spent with AD, days without AD flare, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct/indirect costs. Multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess model parameter uncertainty. RESULTS Over 30 months, with the use of PHF-W instead of CMF, the proportion of children who developed AD and the time spent with AD decreased by 16.0% (28.3% vs. 44.3%) and 6.4 months, respectively, while time without AD flare and QALYs increased by 14.9 days and 0.021 QALYs per patient, respectively. Estimated AD-related discounted costs per child for PHF-W and CMF were SGD 771 and SGD 1,309, respectively (net savings: SGD 538). PHF-W was less expensive and more effective than CMF for 73%, and cost less than SGD 50,000 per QALY for 87% of all multivariate simulations. CONCLUSION Early short-term nutritional intervention with PHF-W instead of CMF may reduce AD incidence and costs for healthy, high-risk, non-exclusively breastfed infants in Singapore. © 2018, Singapore Medical Association.

The collected vibrational spectroscopic data were evaluated by multidimensional statistical methods as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression which enable detection of individual substances in the skin, their identification and mutual differentiation. Gallic acid (GA), a natural phenolic anti-oxidant with many potential healing properties suitable e.g. for atopic dermatitis treatment, was used as an analyte. Effect of GA on the skin surface was examined for four different solvents namely ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ultrahigh purity water (H2O). Moreover, the effects of temperature related to GA solubility in H2O were investigated. During the series of experiments, nonsystematic changes of untreated skin samples were observed; while systematic changes are evident after the skin treatment. The systematic effects correspond to structural changes of the skin constituents during substance penetration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Effect of solvents; Gallic acid; Infrared spectroscopy; Multivariate statistical analysis; Skin; Solubility and temperature","Dermatitis; Dimethyl sulfoxide; Discriminant analysis; Infrared spectroscopy; Least squares approximations; Multivariant analysis; Organic solvents; Skin; Solubility; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectrum analysis; Temperature; Attenuated total reflections; Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); Effect of solvents; Effects of temperature; Gallic acids; Linear discriminant analyses (LDA); Multivariate statistical analysis; Partial least-squares regression; Principal component analysis",,,,,,"Financial support from specific university research ( A1_FCHI_2017_002 “Application of methods of physical chemistry in environmental, materials, and pharmaceutical research”) is gratefully acknowledged.",,,,"Schmook, F.P., Meingassner, J.G., Bilich, A., (2001) Int.

Objective: To determine the associations and clinical characteristics of adult-onset AD. Methods: A prospective study of 356 adults with AD (age ≥18 years) was performed using standardized questionnaires and examination. AD severity was assessed using the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, Eczema Area and Severity Index, Scoring Atopic Dermatitis, body surface area, and numeric rating scale for itch and sleeplessness. Latent class analysis was used to determine dominant clinical phenotypes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between adult-onset AD and distinct phenotypes. Results: One hundred forty-nine adults (41.9%) reported onset of AD during adulthood, with 87 (24.4%) after the age of 50 years. Adult- versus childhood-onset AD was associated with birthplace outside the United States (χ2, P =.0008), but not sex, race/ethnicity, current smoking status, or alcohol consumption (P ≥.11); and decreased personal history of asthma, hay fever, and food allergy and family history of asthma and food allergy (P ≤.0001 for all). There was no significant difference in the Eczema Area and Severity Index, Scoring Atopic Dermatitis, body surface area, numeric rating scale for itch and sleeplessness, or Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure between adult- and childhood-onset AD (Mann-Whitney U test, P ≥.10). Latent class analysis identified 3 classes: (1) high probability of flexural dermatitis and xerosis with intermediate to high probabilities of head, neck, and hand dermatitis; (2) high probability of flexural dermatitis and xerosis, but low probabilities of head, neck, and hand dermatitis; and (3) lower probability of flexural dermatitis, but the highest probabilities of virtually all other signs and symptoms. Adult-onset AD was significantly associated with class 1 (multivariate logistic regression; adjusted odds ratio, 5.54; 95% CI, 1.59-19.28) and class 3 (adjusted odds ratio, 14.03; 95% CI, 2.33-85.50). Conclusions: Self-reported adult-onset AD is common and has distinct phenotypes with lesional predilection for the hands and/or head/neck. © 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Adult onset; Asthma; Atopic dermatitis; Atopic history; Eczema; Hay fever; Severity","adult; adult disease; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; birthplace; body surface; childhood disease; clinical examination; clinical feature; controlled study; disease severity assessment; Eczema Area and Severity Index; ethnicity; family history; female; food allergy; human; insomnia; latent class analysis; major clinical study; male; medical history; numeric rating scale; onset age; Patient Oriented Eczema Measure; phenotype; pollen allergy; probability; prospective study; pruritus; questionnaire; race difference; Scoring Atopic Dermatitis; self report; sex difference; smoking; United States; very elderly; xerosis; adolescent; atopic dermatitis; child; comparative study; middle aged; phenotype; preschool child; severity of illness index; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Prospective Studies; Self Report; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,,,"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS: UL1TR001422",,,,,"Williams, H.C., Epidemiology of human atopic dermatitis—seven areas of notable progress and seven areas of notable ignorance (2013) Vet Dermatol, 24, pp. 3-9.e1-2; Silverberg, J.I., Garg, N., Paller, A.S., Fishbein, A., Zee, P.C., Sleep disturbances in adults with eczema are associated with impaired overall health: a US population-based study (2015) J Invest Dermatol, 135, pp. 56-66; Silverberg, J.I., Hanifin, J.M., Adult eczema prevalence and associations with asthma and other health and demographic factors: a US population-based study (2013) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 132, pp. 1132-1138; Margolis, J.S., Abuabara, K., Bilker, W., Hoffstad, O., Margolis, D.J., Persistence of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (2014) JAMA Dermatol, 150, pp. 593-600; Kim, J.P., Chao, L.X., Simpson, E.L., Silverberg, J.I., Persistence of atopic dermatitis (AD): a systematic review and meta-analysis (2016) J Am Acad Dermatol, 75, pp. 681-687.e11; Hanifin, J.M., Reed, M.L., Eczema, P., A population-based survey of eczema prevalence in the United States (2007) Dermatitis, 18, pp. 82-91; Ozkaya, E., Adult-onset atopic dermatitis (2005) J Am Acad Dermatol, 52, pp. 579-582; Nnoruka, E.N., Current epidemiology of atopic dermatitis in south-eastern Nigeria (2004) Int J Dermatol, 43, pp. 739-744; Sandstrom Falk, M.H., Faergemann, J., Atopic dermatitis in adults: does it disappear with age?

Background: Atopic dermatitis is a chronic recurrent skin disease and common health problem in childhood. It is necessary to use an approach that includes parental factors when considering the effective management of childhood atopic dermatitis. Design: A cross-sectional study design. Methods: A convenience sample, comprising 168 Korean mothers caring for a child with atopic dermatitis under the age of 13, was recruited from the paediatric outpatient departments of two general hospitals in Seoul, South Korea. Data were collected using structured self-reported questionnaires including severity, antecedents, effort, self-efficacy and family management of childhood atopic dermatitis from 1 November 2015–28 February 2016. Descriptive statistics about the participants and variables were examined and data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Results: The hypothetical model had an adequate fit to the data, indicating that severity, antecedents, effort and self-efficacy influenced family management of childhood atopic dermatitis. Conclusion: These results suggest that strategies to support children with atopic dermatitis and their family should consider the influence of such variables. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","atopic dermatitis;

However, a consistent association between 25(OH)D and asthma during adulthood has yet to be found in observational studies. We aimed to test the association between 25(OH)D and asthma during adulthood and hypothesised that this association would be stronger in non-atopic participants. Using information collected on the participants of the 1958 birth cohort, we developed a novel measure of atopic status using total and specific IgE values and reported history of eczema and allergic rhinitis. We designed a nested case-control analysis, stratified by atopic status, and using logistic regression models investigated the association between 25(OH)D measured at age 46 years with the prevalence of asthma and wheezy bronchitis at age 50 years, excluding participants who reported ever having asthma or wheezy bronchitis before the age of 42. In the fully adjusted models, a 10 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D prevalence had a significant association with asthma (aOR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88–1.00). There was some evidence of an atopic dependent trend in the association between 25(OH)D levels and asthma. Further analytical work on the operationalisation of atopy status would prove useful to uncover whether there is a role for 25(OH)D and other risk factors for asthma. © 2018 by the authors.

The objective of the study is to identify clinically homogeneous asthma subphenotypes in a diverse sample of asthmatic children and to assess subphenotype-specific genetic ancestry in African-American asthmatic children. Methods: A total of 1211 asthmatic children including 813 in the Childhood Asthma Management Program and 398 in the Childhood Asthma Research and Education program were studied. Unsupervised cluster analysis on clinical phenotypes was conducted to identify homogeneous subphenotypes. Subphenotype-specific genetic ancestry was estimated for 167 African-American asthmatic children. Genetic ancestry association with subphenotypes/clinical phenotypes were determined. Results: Three distinct subphenotypes were identified: a moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) group with negative skin prick test (SPT) and preserved lung function; a high AD group with positive SPT and airway hyperresponsiveness; and a low AD group with positive SPT and lower lung function. African ancestry at asthma genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs differed between subphenotypes (64, 89, and 94% for the three subphenotypes, respectively) and was inversely correlated with AD; each additional 10% increase in African ancestry was associated with 1.5 fold higher in IgE and 6.3 higher odds of positive SPT (all p-values < 0.0001). Conclusions: By conducting phenotype-based cluster analysis and assessing subphenotype-specific genetic ancestry, we were able to identify homogeneous subphenotypes for childhood asthma that showed significant variation in genetic ancestry of African-American asthmatic children. This finding demonstrates the utility of these complementary approaches to understand and refine childhood asthma subphenotypes and enable more targeted therapy. © 2018 The Author(s).","Childhood asthma; Cluster analysis; Genetic ancestry; Subphenotypes","immunoglobulin E; African; African American; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child; cluster analysis; disease severity; female; genetic association; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; health program; human; lung function; major clinical study; male; phenotype; prick test; priority journal; respiratory tract allergy; school child; single nucleotide polymorphism; subphenotype; Africa; asthma; ethnology; genetics; Africa; Asthma; Child; Cluster Analysis; Female; Humans; Male; Phenotype",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: CTSA

Objective: To evaluate the effect of the temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) treatment in children/adolescents with severe AE. Methods: We recruited 15 children aged 2-16 years with long-standing, severe AE and sensitization to ≥1 perennial inhalant allergen. Run-in period of 6-10 weeks (3 visits) was followed by 12-month treatment with overnight TLA (Airsonett®, Sweden). The primary outcome was eczema severity (SCORAD-Index and Investigator Global Assessment-IGA). Secondary outcomes included child/family dermatology quality of life and family impact questionnaires (CDQLI, FDQLI, DFI), patient-oriented eczema measure (POEM), medication requirements and healthcare contacts. The study is registered as ISRCTN65865773. Results: There was a significant reduction in AE severity ascertained by SCORAD and IGA during the 12-month intervention period (P &lt;.001). SCORAD was reduced from a median of 34.9 [interquartile range 28.75-45.15] at Baseline to 17.2 [12.95-32.3] at the final visit, and IGA improved significantly from 4 [3-4] to 2 [1-3]. We observed a significant improvement in FDQLI (16.0 [12.25-19.0] to 12 [8-18], P =.023) and DFI (P =.011), but not CDQLI or POEM. Compared to 6-month period prior to enrolment, there was a significant reduction at six months after the start of the intervention in potent topical corticosteroids (P =.033). The exploratory cluster analysis revealed two strongly divergent patterns of response, with 9 patients classified as responders, and 6 as non-responders. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance: Addition of TLA device to standard pharmacological treatment may be an effective add-on to the management of difficult-to-control AE. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aeroallergen exposure; allergen avoidance; atopic eczema; environmental control; particle reduction; temperature-controlled laminar airflow","antibiotic agent; calcineurin inhibitor; corticosteroid; emollient agent; adolescent; airborne particle; antibiotic therapy; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child; clinical article; disease duration; disease severity; female; food allergy; health care utilization; human; laminar airflow; male; open study; outcome assessment; particle size; patient compliance; preschool child; priority journal; rhinoconjunctivitis; school child; sensitization; treatment duration; wheezing; atopic dermatitis; clinical trial; infant; microclimate; proof of concept; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Environment, Controlled; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Proof of Concept Study",,,"Airsonett",,"NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre, BRC","The study was funded by the Imperial College NIHR Biomedical Research Centre.

The invasiveness of biopsies has prevented their use in defining individual-level AD pathobiological mechanisms (endotypes) in large research studies. Objective: We sought to determine whether minimally invasive skin tape strip transcriptome analysis identifies gene expression dysregulation in AD and molecular disease endotypes. Methods: We sampled nonlesional and lesional skin tape strips and biopsy specimens from white adult patients with AD (18 male and 12 female patients; age [mean ± SE], 36.3 ± 2.2 years) and healthy control subjects (9 male and 16 female subjects; age [mean ± SE], 34.8 ± 2.2 years). AmpliSeq whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed on extracted RNA. Differential expression, clustering/pathway analyses, immunostaining of skin biopsy specimens, and clinical trait correlations were performed. Results: Skin tape expression profiles were distinct from skin biopsy profiles and better sampled epidermal differentiation complex genes. Skin tape expression of 29 immune and epidermis-related genes (false discovery rate &lt; 5%) separated patients with AD from healthy subjects. Agnostic gene set analyses and clustering revealed 50% of patients with AD exhibited a type 2 inflammatory signature (type 2–high endotype) characterized by differential expression of 656 genes, including overexpression of IL13, IL4R, CCL22, CCR4 (log 2 fold change = 5.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 4.1, respectively) and at a pathway level by T H 2/dendritic cell activation. Both expression and immunostaining of skin biopsy specimens indicated this type 2–high group was enriched for inflammatory, type 2–skewed dendritic cells expressing FcεRI. The type 2–high endotype group exhibited more severe disease by using both the Eczema Area and Severity Index score and body surface area covered by lesions. Conclusion: Minimally invasive expression profiling of nonlesional skin reveals stratification in AD molecular pathology by type 2 inflammation that correlates with disease severity. © 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","atopic dermatitis; inflammation; RNA sequencing; Skin; type 2 immune response","chemokine receptor CCR4; Fc epsilon RI protein; interleukin 13; macrophage derived chemokine; protein; RNA; unclassified drug; transcriptome; adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; cell differentiation; controlled study; dendritic cell; disease severity; epidermis cell; female; gene expression; gene expression profiling; human; human tissue; IL4R gene; immunohistochemistry; intermethod comparison; lymphocyte activation; male; minimally invasive procedure; priority journal; protein expression; RNA sequence; skin biopsy; skin examination; skin tape strip technique; Th2 cell; transcriptomics; type 2 high atopic dermatitis; atopic dermatitis; case control study; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; devices; gene expression profiling; genetic marker; genetic screening; genetics; procedures; sequence analysis; severity of illness index; surgical tape; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Genetic Markers; Genetic Testing; Humans; Male; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Severity of Illness Index; Surgical Tape; Transcriptome",,"chemokine receptor CCR4, 169936-75-8; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; protein, 67254-75-5; RNA, 63231-63-0; Genetic Markers",,,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: R01HL128439, R01HL135156

Alterations in the lipid composition of the epidermis are associated with inflammation and can affect the barrier function of the skin. SHARPIN-deficient cpdm mice develop a chronic dermatitis with similarities to atopic dermatitis in humans. Here, we used a recently-developed approach named multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling and single ion monitoring to rapidly identify discriminative lipid ions. Shorter fatty acyl residues and increased relative amounts of sphingosine ceramides were observed in cpdm epidermis compared to wild type mice. These changes were accompanied by downregulation of the Fasn gene which encodes fatty acid synthase. A profile of diverse lipids was generated by fast screening of over 300 transitions (ion pairs). Tentative attribution of the most significant transitions was confirmed by product ion scan (MS/MS), and the MRM-profiling linear intensity response was validated with a C17-ceramide lipid standard. Relative quantification of sphingosine ceramides CerAS (d18:1/24:0)2OH, CerAS(d18:1/16:0)2OH and CerNS(d18:1/16:0) discriminated between the two groups with 100% accuracy, while the free fatty acids cerotic acid, 16-hydroxy palmitic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had 96.4% of accuracy. Validation by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of the above-mentioned ceramides was in agreement with MRM-profiling results. Identification and rapid monitoring of these lipids represent a tool to assess therapeutic outcomes in SHARPIN-deficient mice and other mouse models of dermatitis and may have diagnostic utility in atopic dermatitis. © 2018 Franco et al.

Longitudinal birth cohort studies provide an opportunity to define subgroups on the basis of disease trajectories, which may represent different genetic and environmental pathomechanisms. Objectives: We sought to investigate the existence of distinct longitudinal phenotypes of AD and test whether these findings are reproducible in 2 independent cohorts. Methods: The presence of AD was examined in 2 birth cohort studies including 9894 children from the United Kingdom (ALSPAC) and 3652 from the Netherlands (PIAMA). AD was defined by parental report of a typical itchy and/or flexural rash. Longitudinal latent class analysis was used to investigate patterns of AD from birth to the age of 11 to 16 years. We investigated associations with known AD risk factors, including FLG null mutations, 23 other established AD-genetic risk variants, and atopic comorbidity. Results: Six latent classes were identified, representing subphenotypes of AD, with remarkable consistency between the 2 cohorts. The most prevalent class was early-onset-early-resolving AD, which was associated with male sex. Two classes of persistent disease were identified (early-onset-persistent and early-onset-late-resolving); these were most strongly associated with the AD-genetic risk score as well as personal and parental history of atopic disease. A yet unrecognized class of mid-onset-resolving AD, not associated with FLG mutations, but strongly associated with asthma, was identified. Conclusions: Six classes based on temporal trajectories of rash were consistently identified in 2 population-based cohorts. The differing risk factor profiles and diverse prognoses demonstrate the potential importance of a stratified medicine approach for AD. © 2017 The Authors","ALSPAC; Atopic dermatitis; eczema; environmental; genetic; latent class analysis; PIAMA","filaggrin; immunoglobulin E; regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1; regulator protein; STAT3 protein; transcription factor; unclassified drug; zinc finger containing transcription factor; zinc finger protein; filaggrin; intermediate filament protein; adolescent; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; breast feeding; child; cohort analysis; comorbidity; early onset early resolving atopic dermatitis; early onset late resolving atopic dermatitis; early onset persistent atopic dermatitis; environmental factor; family history; female; gene mutation; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variation; human; immunoglobulin blood level; late onset resolving atopic dermatitis; latent class analysis; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mid onset resolving atopic dermatitis; Netherlands; onset age; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; sex difference; single nucleotide polymorphism; transient atopic dermatitis; United Kingdom; clinical trial; follow up; genetics; immunology; infant; multicenter study; mutation; preschool child; young adult; Adolescent; Age of Onset; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Intermediate Filament Proteins; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mutation; Risk Factors; United Kingdom; Young Adult",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; filaggrin; Intermediate Filament Proteins",,,"Medical Research Council, MRC: MC_PC_15018, MC_UU_12013/4, MR/J012165/1",,,,,"Williams, H.C., Clinical practice: atopic dermatitis (2005) N Engl J Med, 352, pp. 2314-2324; Kim, J.P., Chao, L.X., Simpson, E.L., Silverberg, J.I., Persistence of atopic dermatitis (AD): a systematic review and meta-analysis (2016) J Am Acad Dermatol, 75, pp. 681-687.e11; Mortz, C.G., Andersen, K.E., Dellgren, C., Barington, T., Bindslev-Jensen, C., Atopic dermatitis from adolescence to adulthood in the TOACS cohort: prevalence, persistence and comorbidities (2015) Allergy, 70, pp. 836-845; Johansson, E.K., Ballardini, N., Bergstrom, A., Kull, I., Wahlgren, C.F., Atopic and nonatopic eczema in adolescence: is there a difference?

The cow's milk is the first foreign protein introduced into the diet of a child on mixed/bottle feeding. The objective of the study: to evaluate the association between the level of specific IgE (sIgE) for cow's milk protein (CMP) and AD severity and development of severe FA forms in infants. Materials and methods: the study included 187 children with AD aged up to 3 years (Me – 1,4 [Q1 – 0,8, Q3 – 2,9] years). Patients were assessed for the specific IgE level in the blood serum (Immuno CAP 100 Phadia) for α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin and casein, as well as for other (household, food, epidermal) allergens. Results: 100 (53,5%) patients were sensitized to CMP; among them: 74 (74%) to α-lactalbumin, 75 (75%) to β-lactoglobulin, 100 (100%) to casein. The severe AD were found to have been significantly more frequent in children with revealed sensitization to CMP comparing with infants without sensitization: 32 vs 17 children respectively (p=0,038). The cluster analysis of patients with sensitization to CMP revealed that patients with high levels of specific IgE to all 3 proteins – α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin and casein significantly more often had severe AD, polyvalent FA and multiple food protein intolerance (MFPI). Conclusion: the use of component diagnostics enables to reveal IgE sensitization to CMP, to identify patients with a risk of developing severe FA forms (severe AD, polyvalent FA, MFPI), to justify an extended allergological examination, and timely prescribe diet therapy with amino acid-based formulas. © 2018, Pediatria Ltd.

Yusho patients suffer from various symptoms; however, after 40 years, some emerging symptoms have been attributed to aging. The prevalence of symptoms and diseases among Yusho patients and the general population was compared in this study. The data obtained from the survey among Yusho patients (1131 patients) by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan in 2008 were compared with the data from a survey conducted among the general population. When selecting the comparison group, the age and residential area (prefecture) were taken into account to match the baseline characteristics of Yusho patients. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the association between Yusho and the prevalence of symptoms and was adjusted for various potential confounding factors (age, sex, body mass index, cigarette smoking, frequency of drinking, and walking time). Skin pigmentation and acneiform eruption were found to be characteristic symptoms of Yusho and were more prevalent in these patients. Other symptoms and diseases associated with Yusho included orthostatic hypotension, hypohidrosis, dysgeusia, Basedow’s disease, hoarseness, cardiac insufficiency, tachycardia, eczema, and hair loss. Symptoms related to aging, such as general fatigue, arthralgia, and numbness in the extremities, were significantly higher in Yusho patients after adjusting for age and lifestyle. This study demonstrated that, 40 years after the outbreak of Yusho, the prevalence of various symptoms and diseases in Yusho patients, including age-related diseases, was higher than that in the general population. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; rice bran oil; comparative study; disease prevalence; factor analysis; health impact; lifestyle; long-term change; PCB; poisoning; public health; survey method; symptom; acne; adult; aged; allergic rhinitis; alopecia; angina pectoris; anhidrosis; anxiety disorder; arthralgia; Article; asthma; astigmatism; atelectasis; atopic dermatitis; autonomic dysfunction; backache; Behcet disease; bipolar disorder; bladder cancer; bladder stone; bleeding; bloating; body mass; bone pain; brain infarction; breast cancer; cataract; cerebrovascular accident; cholecystitis; cholelithiasis; chronic bronchitis; chronic gastritis; cigarette smoking; colon polyp; constipation; controlled study; cystitis; dementia; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; drinking behavior; drug hypersensitivity; dry skin; duodenum ulcer; dysgeusia; dysmenorrhea; dyspnea; eczema; edema; emphysema; endometriosis; epidermoid cyst; epistaxis; esophagus cancer; fatigue; female; food allergy; fracture; frozen shoulder; gallbladder cancer; gingivitis; glaucoma; goiter; gout; Graves disease; hair loss; hallucination; headache; heart arrest; heart failure; heart infarction; heart palpitation; hemorrhoid; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; hoarseness; human; hyperhidrosis; hyperlipidemia; hypothyroidism; insomnia; intellectual impairment; intervertebral disk hernia; intestine cancer; intestine obstruction; irritable colon; kidney cancer; lifestyle; liver cancer; liver dysfunction; lung cancer; lung edema; lung fibrosis; major clinical study; male; male infertility; Meniere disease; menorrhagia; menstrual irregularity; middle aged; myalgia; myositis; nephritis; nephrolithiasis; oligomenorrhea; orthostatic hypotension; osteoporosis; osteosarcoma; otitis media; ovary cancer; ovary cyst; pancreas cancer; pancreatitis; periodontal disease; pneumonia; pollen allergy; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostate hypertrophy; proteinuria; purpura; pustulosis palmoplantaris; rheumatoid arthritis; schizophrenia; scleroderma; Sjoegren syndrome; skin cancer; skin pigmentation; skin pruritus; stomach cancer; stomach ulcer; symptom; systemic lupus erythematosus; tachycardia; taste disorder; thyroid cancer; thyroiditis; tongue cancer; tooth malformation; ureter stone; urticaria; uterus cancer; uterus myoma; vertigo; very elderly; walking; Yusho disease; brain disease; food contamination; Japan; porphyria; prevalence; skin disease; statistical model; Japan; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Diseases; Female; Food Contamination; Humans; Japan; Life Style; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Porphyrias; Prevalence; Rice Bran Oil; Skin Diseases",,"rice bran oil, 68553-81-1; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Rice Bran Oil",,,,"Acknowledgments The authors thank Y.

Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis can be difficult and costly to treat. The long-term health and economic outcomes of a new therapy, dupilumab, have yet to be evaluated. We aimed to identify the cost-effectiveness of dupilumab compared to usual care in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Methods. We compared dupilumab to usual care with emollients for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis inadequately controlled with topical therapy, or for whom topical therapies were medically inadvisable. Subpopulations of moderate and severe patients were examined separately. We used a lifetime Markov model from a US payer perspective with health states categorized by the percent decrease in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score after a patient began an intervention: At least a 50% decrease (EASI 50), 75% decrease (EASI 75), 90% decrease (EASI 90), or no response. Results. The expected lifetime cost for patients treated with dupilumab was $509,600, including $267,800 in dupilumab drug costs and $241,800 in other healthcare costs. Average lifetime cost for usual care was $271,500. Dupilumab provided an additional 1.91 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the remaining lifetime of a patient, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $124,500. The ICER was lower for patients with severe atopic dermatitis ($95,800) than those with moderate atopic dermatitis ($160,000). Key drivers of the model were utility values for quality-of-life for non-responders, and the price of dupilumab. Conclusions. This study was limited by data for health outcomes and costs over long time periods, particularly stratified by severity. We estimated that dupilumab improved health outcomes compared to usual care but with additional costs, with an ICER below commonly cited thresholds for cost-effectiveness. Dupilumab was projected to be more cost-effective in patients with severe atopic dermatitis, but even in patients with moderate atopic dermatitis, the ICER remained below the upper range of commonly cited thresholds. © 2018 Journal of Drugs in Dermatology.",,"dupilumab; emollient agent; dupilumab; emollient agent; IL4R protein, human; interleukin 4 receptor alpha; monoclonal antibody; adult; allergic conjunctivitis; Article; atopic dermatitis; conjunctivitis; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; drug cost; female; health care cost; human; infectious conjunctivitis; injection site reaction; loading drug dose; male; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; topical treatment; antagonists and inhibitors; atopic dermatitis; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; drug administration; economic model; economics; Markov chain; severity of illness index; subcutaneous drug administration; treatment outcome; United States; Adult; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Costs; Emollients; Female; Humans; Injections, Subcutaneous; Interleukin-4 Receptor alpha Subunit; Male; Markov Chains; Models, Economic; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome; United States",,"dupilumab, 1190264-60-8; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Emollients; IL4R protein, human; Interleukin-4 Receptor alpha Subunit; SAR231893",,,,,,,,"Shaw, T.E., Currie, G.P., Koudelka, C.W., Simpson, E.L., Eczema prevalence in the United States: Data from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health (2011) J Invest Dermatol, 131 (1), pp. 67-73; Silverberg, J.I., Hanifin, J.M., Adult eczema prevalence and associations with asthma and other health and demographic factors: A US population-based study (2013) J Allery Clin Immunol, 132 (5), pp. 1132-1138; Silverberg, J.I., Garg, N.K., Paller, A.S., Fishbein, A.B., Zee, P.C., Sleep disturbances in adults with eczema are associated with impaired overall health: A US population-based study (2015) J Invest Dermatol, 135 (1), pp. 56-66; Holm, J.G., Agner, T., Clausen, M.L., Thomsen, S.F., Quality of life and disease severity in patients with atopic dermatitis (2016) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 30 (10), pp. 1760-1767; Yu, S.H., Attarian, H., Zee, P., Silverberg, J.I., Burden of sleep and fatigue in US adults with atopic dermatitis (2016) Dermatitis: Contact, Atopic, Occupational, Drug, 27 (2), pp. 50-58; Weidinger, S., Novak, N., Atopic dermatitis (2016) Lancet (London, England), 387 (10023), pp. 1109-1122; Katz, H.I., Prawer, S.E., Mooney, J.J., Samson, C.R., Preatrophy: Covert sign of thinned skin (1989) J Am Acad Dermatol, 20 (5 PART 1), pp. 731-735; Furue, M., Terao, H., Rikihisa, W., Clinical dose and adverse effects of topical steroids in daily management of atopic dermatitis (2003) Br J Dermatol, 148 (1), pp. 128-133; Lam, L.H., Sugarman, J.L., Adrenal suppression with chronic topical corticosteroid use in psoriasis patients (2016) J Drugs Dermatol, 15 (8), pp. 945-948; Simpson, E.L., Bieber, T., Guttman-Yassky, E., Two phase 3 trials of dupilumab versus placebo in atopic dermatitis (2016) New Engl J Med, 375 (24), pp. 2335-2348; Thaci, D., Chambers, C., Sidhu, M., Dorsch, B., Ehlken, B., Fuchs, S., Twice-weekly treatment with tacrolimus 0.03% ointment in children with atopic dermatitis: Clinical efficacy and economic impact over 12 months (2010) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 24 (9), pp. 1040-1046; Beck, L.A., Thaçi, D., Hamilton, J.D., Dupilumab treatment in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (2014) New Engl J Med, 371 (2), pp. 130-139; Sanofi-Regeneron.

Objective: We investigated patterns of sensitization and AD from early infancy to age 3, and the differential risk of developing allergic diseases within each pattern in a general cohort. Methods: Children (n = 2629) from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study underwent skin prick tests and were assessed clinically for AD at ages 1 and 3 years. We applied an unsupervised latent class analysis (LCA) to the following 5 factors at these ages: AD, food sensitization, inhalant sensitization, poly-sensitization to foods and poly-sensitization to inhalants. The risks for developing asthma, allergic rhinitis and food allergy at 3 years were evaluated for each identified group. Results: Five distinct classes were revealed by LCA: healthy (81.8%), atopic dermatitis (7.6%), inhalant sensitization (3.5%), transient sensitization (4.1%) and persistent sensitization (3.2%). Using healthy children as the baseline, children in the “atopic dermatitis” group had the next lowest risk for all allergic outcomes at 3 years; those in the “inhalant sensitization” group had the highest risk for allergic rhinitis; children in the “transient sensitization” group were at an increased risk for food allergy; while children in the “persistent sensitization” group had the highest risk for all allergic diseases. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance: There is substantial heterogeneity among allergen-sensitized children. Researchers and clinicians need to be aware of the non-specificity associated with labelling children simply as “atopic” and “non-atopic” without considering the timing of their atopic history, type of sensitization and AD status. Children with AD who were poly-sensitized to foods at an early age appear to be at greatest risk of developing other allergic diseases. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","allergic rhinitis; asthma; atopic dermatitis; food sensitization; inhalant sensitization","egg white; food allergen; age; allergic rhinitis; Alternaria alternata; Article; Aspergillus fumigatus; asthma; atopic dermatitis; cat; child; Cladosporium; cockroach; cohort analysis; controlled study; Dermatophagoides; dog; female; food allergy; grass; high risk population; human; low risk population; major clinical study; male; milk; nonhuman; peanut; peanut allergy; Penicillium; prevalence; prick test; priority journal; ragweed; sensitization; soy food; tree; weed",,"egg white, 9006-50-2",,,"Environment Canada

Methods: A systematic search of the following online databases was performed: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, EconLit, Scopus, Health Technology Assessment, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and Web of Science. Papers were eligible for inclusion if they described a decision–analytic model evaluating both the costs and benefits associated with an intervention or prevention for atopic eczema. Data were extracted using a standardised form by two independent reviewers, whilst quality was assessed using the model-specific Philips criteria. Results: Twenty-four models were identified, evaluating either preventions (n = 12) or interventions (n = 12): 14 reported using a Markov modelling approach, four utilised decision trees and one a discrete event simulation, whilst five did not specify the approach. The majority, 22 studies, reported that the intervention was dominant or cost effective, given the assumptions and analytical perspective taken. Notably, the models tended to be short-term (16 used a time horizon of ≤1 year), often providing little justification for the limited time horizon chosen. The methodological and reporting quality of the studies was generally weak, with only seven studies fulfilling more than 50% of their applicable Philips criteria. Conclusions: This is the first systematic review of decision models in eczema. Whilst the majority of models reported favourable outcomes in terms of the cost effectiveness of the new intervention, the usefulness of these findings for decision-making is questionable.

It has been used as a hepatoprotactant. It is also used for ameliorating inflammatory reactions. Although there are several investigations on other Artemisia species, there is no systematic study describing the role of A. capillaris MeOH extract, its solvent soluble fractions, or derived anti-inflammatory principal components in regulating inflammatory conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to elucidate anti-inflammatory mechanisms of A. capillaris. Results revealed that MeOH extract of A. capillaris could decrease LPS-stimulated NO secretion. Of tested fractions, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH strongly inhibited NO release from RAW264.7 cells. Bioactive mediators derived from CH2Cl2 and n-BuOH fractions elicited potent anti-inflammatory actions and strikingly abrogated LPS-triggered NO accumulation in RAW264.7 cells. Of particular interest, capillin and isoscopoletin possessed the most potent NO suppressive effects. Western blot analysis validated the molecular mechanism of NO inhibition and showed that capillin and isoscopoletin significantly down-regulated iNOS and COX-2 protein expression. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that MeOH extract, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH fractions from A. capillaris and its derived lead candidates can potently suppress inflammatory responses in macrophages by hampering NO release and down-regulating iNOS and COX-2 signaling. © 2018, Korean Society of Pharmacognosy.

Design Pragmatic randomised open label superiority trial with two parallel groups. Setting 96 general practices in Wales and western and southern England. Participants 483 children aged 1 to 11 years, fulfilling UK diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis. Children with very mild eczema and children who bathed less than once weekly were excluded. Interventions Participants in the intervention group were prescribed emollient bath additives by their usual clinical team to be used regularly for 12 months. The control group were asked to use no bath additives for 12 months. Both groups continued with standard eczema management, including leave-on emollients, and caregivers were given standardised advice on how to wash participants. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was eczema control measured by the patient oriented eczema measure (POEM, scores 0-7 mild, 8-16 moderate, 17-28 severe) weekly for 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were eczema severity over one year (monthly POEM score from baseline to 52 weeks), number of eczema exacerbations resulting in primary healthcare consultation, disease specific quality of life (dermatitis family impact), generic quality of life (child health utility-9D), utilisation of resources, and type and quantity of topical corticosteroid or topical calcineurin inhibitors prescribed. Results 483 children were randomised and one child was withdrawn, leaving 482 children in the trial: 51% were girls (244/482), 84% were of white ethnicity (447/470), and the mean age was 5 years. 96% (461/482) of participants completed at least one post-baseline POEM, so were included in the analysis, and 77% (370/482) completed questionnaires for more than 80% of the time points for the primary outcome (12/16 weekly questionnaires to 16 weeks). The mean baseline POEM score was 9.5 (SD 5.7) in the bath additives group and 10.1 (SD 5.8) in the no bath additives group. The mean POEM score over the 16 week period was 7.5 (SD. 6.0) in the bath additives group and 8.4 (SD 6.0) in the no bath additives group. No statistically significant difference was found in weekly POEM scores between groups over 16 weeks. After controlling for baseline severity and confounders (ethnicity, topical corticosteroid use, soap substitute use) and allowing for clustering of participants within centres and responses within participants over time, POEM scores in the no bath additives group were 0.41 points higher than in the bath additives group (95% confidence interval â '0.27 to 1.10), below the published minimal clinically important difference for POEM of 3 points. The groups did not differ in secondary outcomes, economic outcomes, or adverse effects. Conclusions This trial found no evidence of clinical benefit from including emollient bath additives in the standard management of eczema in children. Further research is needed into optimal regimens for leave-on emollient and soap substitutes. © 2018 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.",,"calcineurin inhibitor; corticosteroid; emollient agent; emollient bath additive; liquid paraffin; soap; unclassified drug; emollient agent; Article; child; childhood disease; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; eczema; erythema; ethnicity; female; health care utilization; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; patient oriented eczema measure; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; side effect; skin disease assessment; treatment outcome; bath; clinical trial; cost benefit analysis; drug effect; eczema; health care quality; infant; preschool child; primary health care; severity of illness index; skin; United Kingdom; Baths; Child; Child, Preschool; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Eczema; Emollients; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Primary Health Care; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Skin; Standard of Care; Treatment Outcome; United Kingdom",,"liquid paraffin, 8012-95-1; Emollients",,,"National Institute for Health Research, NIHR

OBJECTIVE To investigate whether an intervention to promote prolonged and exclusive breastfeeding protects against asthma, atopic eczema, and low lung function in adolescence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Follow-up of the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT), a cluster randomized trial in 30 Belarusian maternity hospitals and affiliated polyclinics; recruitment of 17 046 healthy term infants took place from June 15, 1996, to December 31, 1997. Data analysis was conducted from May 9, 2016, to April 21, 2017. The primary analytic approach was by modified intention-to-treat analysis. INTERVENTIONS Randomization to receive a breastfeeding promotion intervention vs usual care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Spirometry and flexural eczema on standardized skin examination by study pediatricians were the primary outcomes; secondary outcomes were self-reported asthma diagnosis ever, and wheezing and flexural eczema symptoms in the previous year. RESULTS A total of 13 557 (79.5%) participants were followed up from September 15, 2012 to July 15, 2015. The intervention (7064 [79.7%]) and control (6493 [79.4%]) groups were similar at follow-up (3590 [50.8%] and 3391 [52.2%] male; mean [SD] age, 16.2 [0.6] and 16.1 [0.5] years, respectively). In the intervention group, 0.3%(21 of 7064) had flexural eczema on skin examination and mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio z score was -0.10 (1.82), compared with 0.7%(43 of 6493) and 0.35 (1.34), respectively, in the control group. In modified intention-to-treat analysis, accounting for clustering by polyclinic, a 54%lower risk of flexural eczema on skin examination was observed in the intervention compared with the control group (odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95%CI, 0.25 to 0.86). Self-reported flexural eczema symptoms in the past year (OR, 0.57; 95%CI, 0.27 to 1.18), asthma (OR, 0.76; 95%CI, 0.47 to 1.23), and wheezing in the past year (OR, 0.66; 95%CI, 0.37 to 1.18) were less frequently reported in the intervention compared with the control group, but 95%CIs were wide and included the null. There was no significant difference in the FEV1/FVC ratio z score (β -0.15; 95%CI, -0.76 to 0.45). All results were similar with additional adjustment for baseline characteristics, on instrumental variable analysis, and with multiple imputation among all 17 046 randomized participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A breastfeeding promotion intervention reduced flexural dermatitis risk but had no detectable effect on lung function or questionnaire-derived measures of atopic eczema or asthma in adolescence in a setting where atopic eczema and allergies are rare. © 2017 American Medical Association.

We hypothesized that sensitization develops as specific patterns with respect to age at debut, development over time, and involved allergens and that such patterns might be more biologically and clinically relevant. Objective We sought to explore latent patterns of sensitization during the first 6 years of life and investigate whether such patterns associate with the development of asthma, rhinitis, and eczema. Methods We investigated 398 children from the at-risk Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2000 (COPSAC2000) birth cohort with specific IgE against 13 common food and inhalant allergens at the ages of ½, 1½, 4, and 6 years. An unsupervised cluster analysis for 3-dimensional data (nonnegative sparse parallel factor analysis) was used to extract latent patterns explicitly characterizing temporal development of sensitization while clustering allergens and children. Subsequently, these patterns were investigated in relation to asthma, rhinitis, and eczema. Verification was sought in an independent unselected birth cohort (BAMSE) constituting 3051 children with specific IgE against the same allergens at 4 and 8 years of age. Results The nonnegative sparse parallel factor analysis indicated a complex latent structure involving 7 age- and allergen-specific patterns in the COPSAC2000 birth cohort data: (1) dog/cat/horse, (2) timothy grass/birch, (3) molds, (4) house dust mites, (5) peanut/wheat flour/mugwort, (6) peanut/soybean, and (7) egg/milk/wheat flour. Asthma was solely associated with pattern 1 (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5-7.2), rhinitis with patterns 1 to 4 and 6 (OR, 2.2-4.3), and eczema with patterns 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 (OR, 1.6-2.5). All 7 patterns were verified in the independent BAMSE cohort (R2 &gt; 0.89). Conclusion This study suggests the presence of specific sensitization patterns in early childhood differentially associated with development of clinical outcomes. Using such patterns in future research might provide more robust and clinically relevant results. © 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","asthma; children; eczema; patterns; rhinitis; Sensitization; specific IgE","allergen; immunoglobulin E; allergic rhinitis; Artemisia vulgaris; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; birch; cat; child; childhood disease; clinical outcome; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; Dermatophagoides; disease predisposition; dog; eczema; egg; female; horse; human; major clinical study; male; milk; mould; onset age; peanut; phenotype; Phleum pratense; preschool child; priority journal; school child; sensitization; soybean; wheat flour; age; allergic rhinitis; asthma; eczema; immunization; immunology; infant; newborn; prospective study; risk; statistics and numerical data; Sweden; Age Factors; Age of Onset; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Cohort Studies; Eczema; Female; Humans; Immunization; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Prospective Studies; Rhinitis, Allergic; Risk; Sweden",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,,"Malby Schoos, A.-M., Krogsgaard Chawes, B.L., Rasmussen, M.A., Bloch, J., Bønnelykke, K., Bisgaard, H., Atopic endotype in childhood (2016) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 137, pp. 844-851. , e4; Simpson, A., Tan, V.Y.F., Winn, J., Svensén, M., Bishop, C.M., Heckerman, D.E., Beyond atopy: multiple patterns of sensitization in relation to asthma in a birth cohort study (2010) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 181, pp. 1200-1206; Lazic, N., Roberts, G., Custovic, A., Belgrave, D., Bishop, C.M., Winn, J., Multiple atopy phenotypes and their associations with asthma: similar findings from two birth cohorts (2013) Allergy, 68, pp. 764-770; Stoltz, D.J., Jackson, D.J., Evans, M.D., Gangnon, R.E., Tisler, C.J., Gern, J.E., Specific patterns of allergic sensitization in early childhood and asthma and rhinitis risk (2013) Clin Exp Allergy, 43, pp. 233-241; Kull, I., Melen, E., Alm, J., Hallberg, J., Svartengren, M., van Hage, M., Breast-feeding in relation to asthma, lung function, and sensitization in young schoolchildren (2010) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 125, pp. 1013-1019; Bisgaard, H., The Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC): design, rationale, and baseline data from a longitudinal birth cohort study (2004) Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol, 93, pp. 381-389; Bisgaard, H., Hermansen, M.N., Buchvald, F., Loland, L., Halkjaer, L.B., Bønnelykke, K., Childhood asthma after bacterial colonization of the airway in neonates (2007) N Engl J Med, 357, pp. 1487-1495; Bisgaard, H., Hermansen, M.N., Loland, L., Halkjaer, L.B., Buchvald, F., Intermittent inhaled corticosteroids in infants with episodic wheezing (2006) N Engl J Med, 354, pp. 1998-2005; Wickman, M., Asarnoj, A., Tillander, H., Andersson, N., Bergström, A., Kull, I., Childhood-to-adolescence evolution of IgE antibodies to pollens and plant foods in the BAMSE cohort (2014) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 133, pp. 580-582; Ballardini, N., Nilsson, C., Nilsson, M., Lilja, G., ImmunoCAP Phadiatop Infant—a new blood test for detecting IgE sensitisation in children at 2 years of age (2006) Allergy, 61, pp. 337-343; Braun-Fahrländer, C., Wüthrich, B., Gassner, M., Grize, L., Sennhauser, F.H., Varonier, H.S., Validation of a rhinitis symptom questionnaire (ISAAC core questions) in a population of Swiss school children visiting the school health services.

IgE sensitization can occur through an impaired skin barrier. Filaggrin gene (FLG) mutation is associated with eczema and possibly also with IgE sensitization. Objective We sought to explore the longitudinal relation between preschool eczema (PSE), FLG mutation, or both and IgE sensitization in childhood. Methods A total of 3201 children from the BAMSE (Children Allergy Milieu Stockholm Epidemiology) birth cohort recruited from the general population were included. Regular parental questionnaires identified children with eczema. Blood samples were collected at 4, 8, and 16 years of age for analysis of specific IgE. FLG mutation analysis was performed on 1890 of the children. Results PSE was associated with IgE sensitization to both food allergens and aeroallergens up to age 16 years (overall adjusted odds ratio, 2.30; 95% CI, 2.00-2.66). This association was even stronger among children with persistent PSE. FLG mutation was associated with IgE sensitization to peanut at age 4 years (adjusted odds ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.03-3.44) but not to other allergens up to age 16 years. FLG mutation and PSE were not effect modifiers for the association between IgE sensitization and PSE or FLG mutation, respectively. Sensitized children with PSE were characterized by means of polysensitization, but no other specific IgE sensitization patterns were found. Conclusions PSE is associated with IgE sensitization to both food allergens and aeroallergens up to 16 years of age. FLG mutation is associated with IgE sensitization to peanut but not to other allergens. Sensitized children with preceding PSE are more often polysensitized. © 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Allergens; atopic dermatitis; birth cohort; filaggrin; food allergy; IgE; peanut; population; sensitization; skin barrier","filaggrin; food allergen; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E antibody; allergen; filaggrin; immunoglobulin E; intermediate filament protein; adolescent; age; Article; asthma; child; childhood; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; eczema; gene mutation; genetic association; human; major clinical study; peanut allergy; priority journal; rhinitis; risk assessment; secondary analysis; sensitization; Arachis; dna mutational analysis; eczema; female; food allergy; genetic association study; genetics; genotype; immunization; immunology; male; metabolism; mutation; pathology; preschool child; skin; Sweden; Adolescent; Allergens; Arachis; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; DNA Mutational Analysis; Eczema; Female; Food Hypersensitivity; Genetic Association Studies; Genotype; Humans; Immunization; Immunoglobulin E; Intermediate Filament Proteins; Male; Mutation; Skin; Sweden",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Allergens; filaggrin; Immunoglobulin E; Intermediate Filament Proteins",,,"261357

TSLP forms a ternary complex with the TSLP receptor (TSLPR) and the interleukin-7-receptor subunit alpha (IL-7Rα), thereby activating a signaling cascade that culminates in the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. In this study, we conducted an in silico characterization of the TSLP:TSLPR complex to investigate the drugability of this complex. Two commercially available fragment libraries were screened computationally for possible inhibitors and a selection of fragments was subsequently tested in vitro. The screening setup consisted of two orthogonal assays measuring TSLP binding to TSLPR: a BLI-based assay and a biochemical assay based on a TSLP:alkaline phosphatase fusion protein. Four fragments pertaining to diverse chemical classes were identified to reduce TSLP:TSLPR complex formation to less than 75% in millimolar concentrations. We have used unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to develop a Markov state model that characterized the binding pathway of the most interesting compound. This work provides a proof-of-principle for use of fragments in the inhibition of TSLP:TSLPR complexation. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"CRLF2 protein, human; cytokine; cytokine receptor; protein binding; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; chemistry; computer interface; drug effect; human; metabolism; molecular docking; preclinical study; protein conformation; Th2 cell; Cytokines; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Humans; Molecular Docking Simulation; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Receptors, Cytokine; Th2 Cells; User-Computer Interface",,"CRLF2 protein, human; Cytokines; Receptors, Cytokine; thymic stromal lymphopoietin",,,"G0C2214N

No Arabic version of the UCT is available to assess disease control in patients with chronic urticaria (CU). Secondary objectives were to assess disease control in Lebanese CU patients and determine influence factors. Methods: This is a prospective observational study of 178 CU patients diagnosed during their first visit to a private Allergy/Immunology Clinic, Hotel Dieu de France Hospital, Beirut, Lebanon between January and December 2014. Results: Factor analysis showed that all 4 UCT items on the Arabic version converged over a solution of one factor. A high internal consistency was found with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.824. Most patients in this study had chronic spontaneous urticaria (96%), of which 19% also had inducible urticaria. The majority was <40 years (67.4%), with disease duration of <2 years (70.8%). Most patients used H1-antihistamines, but unfortunately, 34.3% used systemic glucocorticosteroids, of which 24.7% also used H1-antihistamines. The disease was poorly controlled in most patients (79.2%, UCT <12). Age, gender, duration, diagnosis, triggers, and/or history of atopy had no influence. Conclusion: We developed the first linguistically validated Arabic UCT to improve CU management in Arabic speaking patients. We also found that disease control was poor in most CU patients, and is unaffected by age, disease duration, gender, subtype, triggers, history of atopy, and/or previous treatments. © 2017, Saudi Arabian Armed Forces Hospital.

However up to 3% of adults remain affected by the disease. The onset and course of the disease is influenced by various genetic and environmental factors. Although the immune system has a great effect on the outcome of the disease, metabolic markers can also try to explain the background of atopic dermatitis. In this study we analyzed the serum of patients with atopic dermatitis using both targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches. We found the most significant changes to be related to phosphatidylcholines, acylcarnitines and their ratios and a cleavage peptide of Fibrinogen A-α. These findings that have not been reported before will further help to understand this complex disease. © 2017 Ottas et al.

This study profiled proteomic signatures in serum from subjects with AD, PS, and CD compared with healthy controls (HC). Objective: Identify unique proteomic signatures to distinguish between inflammatory diseases with similar epidermal disruption and overlapping epithelial inflammation. Methods: Sera from 20 subjects with moderate to severe AD, 10 subjects with CD, 12 subjects with moderate to severe PS, 10 subjects with both AD and CD, and 10 HC with no history of skin disease was analysed using high-throughput proteomic analysis that detects expression of 1129 protein targets. Protein expression was compared between disease and HC, and across diseases for statistical significance (fold change≥1.5 and false discovery rate≤0.05), to identify unique proteomic signatures for each disease. Results: Complement C5A anaphylatoxin (C5A), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), C-reactive protein (CRP), ILT-4, C-C motif ligand 18 (PARC), and sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 14 (SIG14) were significantly modulated in all three diseases compared with HC. We identified unique signatures for AD (Immunoglobulin E (IgE), thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC)), CD (10 proteins), and PS (kynureninase (KYNU)). Proteomic profiling in subjects with both AD and CD identified additional dysregulated proteins compared with subjects with either condition alone, indicating an exacerbated inflammation reaction. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Unique sera proteomic signatures may distinguish between inflammatory skin diseases despite similar epidermal barrier disruption and epithelial inflammation. This may provide insight into disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention in difficult-to-treat subjects. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","atopic dermatitis; biomarkers; clinical immunology; contact dermatitis; dermatology; psoriasis","C reactive protein; complement component C5a; eotaxin 3; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 22; kynureninase; lipopolysaccharide binding protein; macrophage derived chemokine; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; monocyte chemotactic protein 4; protein; protein ParC; sialic acid binding ig like 14; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; unclassified drug; autacoid; immunoglobulin E; proteome; adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; blood sampling; clinical article; contact dermatitis; controlled study; disease exacerbation; female; human; male; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; proteomics; psoriasis; skin disease; upregulation; atopic dermatitis; blood; case control study; cluster analysis; contact dermatitis; immunology; metabolism; procedures; skin disease; Case-Control Studies; Cluster Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dermatitis, Contact; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Inflammation Mediators; Male; Proteome; Proteomics; Skin Diseases",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; gamma interferon inducible protein 10, 97741-20-3; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; interleukin 22, 457106-70-6, 478219-35-1, 554460-75-2; kynureninase, 9024-78-6; lipopolysaccharide binding protein, 203946-66-1; monocyte chemotactic protein 4, 173146-42-4, 177346-98-4; protein, 67254-75-5; thymus and activation regulated chemokine, 181532-29-6; Immunoglobulin E; Inflammation Mediators; Proteome",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

However, it is unclear whether this diversity exists at a biological level. Objective We sought to test the hypothesis that AD is heterogeneous at the biological level of individual inflammatory mediators. Methods Sera from 193 adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD (six area, six sign atopic dermatitis [SASSAD] score: geometric mean, 22.3 [95% CI, 21.3-23.3] and 39.1 [95% CI, 37.5-40.9], respectively) and 30 healthy control subjects without AD were analyzed for 147 serum mediators, total IgE levels, and 130 allergen-specific IgE levels. Population heterogeneity was assessed by using principal component analysis, followed by unsupervised k-means cluster analysis of the principal components. Results Patients with AD showed pronounced evidence of inflammation compared with healthy control subjects. Principal component analysis of data on sera from patients with AD revealed the presence of 4 potential clusters. Fifty-seven principal components described approximately 90% of the variance. Unsupervised k-means cluster analysis of the 57 largest principal components delivered 4 distinct clusters of patients with AD. Cluster 1 had high SASSAD scores and body surface areas with the highest levels of pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, and soluble CD14. Cluster 2 had low SASSAD scores with the lowest levels of IFN-α, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Cluster 3 had high SASSAD scores with the lowest levels of IFN-β, IL-1, and epithelial cytokines. Cluster 4 had low SASSAD scores but the highest levels of the inflammatory markers IL-1, IL-4, IL-13, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. Conclusion AD is a heterogeneous disease both clinically and biologically. Four distinct clusters of patients with AD have been identified that could represent endotypes with unique biological mechanisms. Elucidation of these endotypes warrants further investigation and will require future intervention trials with specific agents, such as biologics. © 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Atopic dermatitis; clusters; disease heterogeneity; endotypes; personalized medicine; phenotypes; principal component analysis; unsupervised cluster analysis","activation regulated chemokine; beta interferon; biological marker; CD14 antigen; chemokine; cytokine; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 1; interleukin 13; interleukin 4; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; allergen; biological marker; cytokine; adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; cluster analysis; controlled study; demography; disease severity; female; geometry; human; inflammation; major clinical study; male; principal component analysis; priority journal; protein blood level; scoring system; six area six sign atopic dermatitis score; asthma; blood; classification; comorbidity; Dermatitis, Atopic; immunology; rhinitis; Adult; Allergens; Asthma; Biomarkers; Comorbidity; Cytokines; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Male; Rhinitis",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, 140208-24-8; vasculotropin, 127464-60-2; Allergens; Biomarkers; Cytokines; Immunoglobulin E",,,,,,,,"Eyerich, K., Novak, N., Immunology of atopic eczema: overcoming the Th1/Th2 paradigm (2013) Allergy, 68, pp. 974-982; Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis 2.0: from the clinical phenotype to the molecular taxonomy and stratified medicine (2012) Allergy, 67, pp. 1475-1482; Beck, L.A., Thaci, D., Hamilton, J.D., Graham, N.M., Bieber, T., Rocklin, R., Dupilumab treatment in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (2014) N Engl J Med, 371, pp. 130-139; Thaci, D., Simpson, E.L., Beck, L.A., Bieber, T., Blauvelt, A., Papp, K., Efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis inadequately controlled by topical treatments: a randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b trial (2016) Lancet, 387, pp. 40-52; Simpson, E.L., Bieber, T., Guttman-Yassky, E., Beck, L.A., Blauvelt, A., Cork, M.J., Two phase 3 trials of dupilumab versus placebo in atopic dermatitis (2016) N Engl J Med, 375, pp. 2335-2348; Hatcher, L., A step-by-step approach to using the SAS® system for factor analysis and structural equation modeling (1994), SAS Publishing Cary (NC); Ghebre, M.A., Bafadhel, M., Desai, D., Cohen, S.E., Newbold, P., Rapley, L., Biological clustering supports both “Dutch” and “British” hypotheses of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2015) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 135, pp. 63-72; Berth-Jones, J., Six area, six sign atopic dermatitis (SASSAD) severity score: a simple system for monitoring disease activity in atopic dermatitis (1996) Br J Dermatol, 135, pp. 25-30; Thijs, J.L., Nierkens, S., Herath, A., Bruijnzeel-Koomen, C.A., Knol, E.F., Giovannone, B., A panel of biomarkers for disease severity in atopic dermatitis (2015) Clin Exp Allergy, 45, pp. 698-701; Hanifin, J.M., Rajka, G., Diagnostic features of atopic-dermatitis (1980) Acta Derm Venereol, 92, pp. 44-47; Suarez-Farinas, M., Dhingra, N., Gittler, J., Shemer, A., Cardinale, I., de Guzman Strong, C., Intrinsic atopic dermatitis shows similar TH2 and higher TH17 immune activation compared with extrinsic atopic dermatitis (2013) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 132, pp. 361-370; Noda, S., Suarez-Farinas, M., Ungar, B., Kim, S.J., de Guzman Strong, C., Xu, H., The Asian atopic dermatitis phenotype combines features of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis with increased TH17 polarization (2015) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 136, pp. 1254-1264; Lotvall, J., Akdis, C.A., Bacharier, L.B., Bjermer, L., Casale, T.B., Custovic, A., Asthma endotypes: a new approach to classification of disease entities within the asthma syndrome (2011) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 127, pp. 355-360; Muraro, A., Lemanske, R.F., Jr., Hellings, P.W., Akdis, C.A., Bieber, T., Casale, T.B., Precision medicine in patients with allergic diseases: airway diseases and atopic dermatitis—PRACTALL document of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 137, pp. 1347-1358; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02755649, A study to assess the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with severe atopic dermatitis (AD) that are not controlled with oral cyclosporine A (CSA) or for those who cannot take oral CSA because it is not medically advisable.

Objectives The aim of the Severe Asthma Molecular Phenotype cohort was to characterize phenotypes of severe recurrent wheeze and severe asthma during childhood in terms of triggers (allergic or not), involved cells (eosinophil or neutrophil), and corticoid responsiveness. Methods Children with moderate-to-severe asthma and preschool children with moderate-to-severe recurrent wheeze were enrolled prospectively. They underwent standardized clinical and blood workup, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) evaluation. Cluster analysis was applied to 350 children with 34 variables. Results Three clusters were identified: cluster 1, Neutrophilic steroid-refractory recurrent wheeze phenotype, with 138 children uncontrolled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (92%, P &lt;.001), with more history of pneumonia (31%, P &lt;.001), more gastroesophageal reflux disease (37%, P &lt;.001), and the highest blood neutrophil count (mean 4.524 cells/mm3, P =.05); cluster 2, Severe recurrent wheeze with sensitization to a single aeroallergen (12%, P =.002), with 104 children controlled with high-dose ICS (63%, P &lt;.001); cluster 3, Eosinophilic steroid-refractory asthma phenotype, with 108 children uncontrolled despite high-dose ICS (76%, P &lt;.001) with more allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies (82%, 40%, 31%, P &lt;.001, respectively). They also had a higher blood eosinophil count and a higher percentage of BAL eosinophil (506/mm3, 2.6%, P &lt;.001 respectively). Conclusions Inflammation pathway of asthma and recurrent wheeze are related to eosinophil cells in older children and neutrophil cells in younger children. These results could improve personalized treatments. © 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Bacterial infection; Children; Gastroesophageal reflux; Multiple allergies; Severe asthma; Severe recurrent wheeze phenotypes","corticosteroid; adolescent; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; blood examination; child; child health care; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; corticosteroid therapy; disease classification; disease exacerbation; disease severity; drug megadose; drug response; eosinophil count; eosinophilic steroid refractory asthma; eosinophilic steroid refractory asthma; female; food allergy; gastroesophageal reflux; human; lung lavage; major clinical study; male; medical history; neutrophil count; neutrophilic steroid refractory recurrent wheeze; neutrophilic steroid refractory recurrent wheeze; phenotype; pneumonia; prospective study; wheezing; abnormal respiratory sound; asthma; drug resistance; eosinophil; immunology; infant; neutrophil; preschool child; recurrent disease; severity of illness index; treatment outcome; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Disease Progression; Drug Resistance; Eosinophils; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Neutrophils; Recurrence; Respiratory Sounds; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome",,"Adrenal Cortex Hormones",,,,,,,,"Barnes, P.J., Pathophysiology of allergic inflammation (2002) Immunol Rev, 242, pp. 31-50; Humbert, M., Menz, G., Ying, S., Corrigan, C.J., Robinson, D.S., Durham, S.R., The immunopathology of extrinsic (atopic) and intrinsic (non-atopic) asthma: more similarities than differences (1999) Immunol Today, 20, pp. 528-533; Herr, M., Just, J., Nikasinovic, L., Foucault, C., Le Marec, A.M., Giordanella, J.P., Risk factors and characteristics of respiratory and allergic phenotypes in early childhood (2012) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 130, pp. 389-396; Just, J., Gouvis-Echraghi, R., Couderc, R., Guillemot-Lambert, N., Saint-Pierre, P., Novel severe wheezy young children phenotypes: boys atopic multiple-trigger and girls nonatopic uncontrolled wheeze (2012) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 130, pp. 103-110; Romanet-Manent, S., Charpin, D., Magnan, A., Lanteaume, A., Vervloet, D., Allergic vs nonallergic asthma: what makes the difference?

In Korea, there is a strong interest in the standardization of Traditional Medicine (TM). In order to standardize TM treatment, standardization of SD should be given priority. The aim of this study was to explore the SD, or symptom clusters, of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) using non-negative factorization methods and k-means clustering analysis. We screened 80 patients and enrolled 73 eligible patients. One TM dermatologist evaluated the symptoms/signs using an existing clinical dataset from patients with AD. This dataset was designed to collect 15 dermatologic and 18 systemic symptoms/signs associated with AD. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to decompose the original data into a matrix with three features and a weight matrix. The point of intersection of the three coordinates from each patient was placed in three-dimensional space. With five clusters, the silhouette score reached 0.484, and this was the best silhouette score obtained from two to nine clusters. Patients were clustered according to the varying severity of concurrent symptoms/signs. Through the distribution of the null hypothesis generated by 10,000 permutation tests, we found significant cluster-specific symptoms/signs from the confidence intervals in the upper and lower 2.5% of the distribution. Patients in each cluster showed differences in symptoms/signs and severity. In a clinical situation, SD and treatment are based on the practitioners' observations and clinical experience. SD, identified through informatics, can contribute to development of standardized, objective, and consistent SD for each disease. © 2017","atopic; Cluster analysis; Dermatitis; k-means cluster analysis; non-negative matrix factorization; Syndrome differentiation","Cluster analysis; Dermatitis; Diagnosis; Matrix algebra; Standardization; atopic; K-means cluster analysis; K-means clustering analysis; Non-negative factorization; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Point of intersections; Syndrome differentiations; Three dimensional space; Factorization; adolescent; adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; child; chill; clinical feature; cluster analysis; cold; dermatologist; disease severity; erythema; exudate; female; fever; human; hyperhidrosis; insomnia; major clinical study; male; priority journal; pruritus; sleep disorder; standardization; symptomatology; syndrome differentiation; traditional medicine; algorithm; atopic dermatitis; pathophysiology; preschool child; South Korea; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Male; Republic of Korea; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,"World Health Organization, WHO International Standard Terminologies on Traditional Medicine in the Western Pacific Region (2007), World Health Organization Western Pacific Region; (2015) Evidence Based Korean Medicine Clinical Practice Guideline Development Committee for Atopic Dermatitis (Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine TSoKMO, Otolaryngology Dermatology): Korean Medicine Clinical Practice Guideline for Atopic Dermatitis(KMCPG_Atopic Dermatitis), , Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine Daejeon, Korea; Mingyu You, G.-Z.L., Data Analytics for Traditional Chinese Medicine Research (2014), Springer New York; Ji, Z., Meng, G., Huang, D., Yue, X., Wang, B., NMFBFS: a NMF-based feature selection method in identifying pivotal clinical symptoms of hepatocellular carcinoma (2015) Comput.

We examined the relationship between timing and patterns of food introduction and sensitization to foods at age 1 year in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort study. Methods: Nutrition questionnaire data prospectively collected at age 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months were used to determine timing of introduction of cow's milk products, egg, and peanut. At age 1 year, infants underwent skin prick testing to cow's milk, egg white, and peanut. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the impact of timing of food exposures on sensitization outcomes, and latent class analysis was used to study patterns of food introduction within the cohort. Results: Among 2124 children with sufficient data, delaying introduction of cow's milk products, egg, and peanut beyond the first year of life significantly increased the odds of sensitization to that food (cow's milk adjOR 3.69, 95% CI 1.37-9.08; egg adjOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.25-2.80; peanut adjOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.07-3.01). Latent class analysis produced a three-class model: early, usual, and delayed introduction. A pattern of delayed introduction, characterized by avoidance of egg and peanut during the first year of life, increased the odds of sensitization to any of the three tested foods (adjOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.26-2.49). Conclusions: Avoidance of potentially allergenic foods during the first year of life significantly increased the odds of sensitization to the corresponding foods. © 2017 The Authors.

However, a specific description of subtypes of atopic dermatitis depending on the timing of onset and progression of the disease in childhood is lacking. OBJECTIVE To identify different phenotypes of atopic dermatitis using a definition based on symptoms before age 6 years and to determine whether some subtypes are more at risk for developing other allergic diseases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Protection Against Allergy Study in Rural Environments (PASTURE) is a European birth cohort where pregnant women were recruited between August 2002 and March 2005 and divided in 2 groups dependent on whether they lived on a farm. Children from this cohort with data on atopic dermatitis from birth to 6 years of age were included. EXPOSURES Atopic dermatitis, defined as an itchy rash on typical locations from birth to 6 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The latent class analysiswas used to identify subtypes of atopic dermatitis in childhood based on the course of symptoms. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to analyze the association between atopic dermatitis phenotypes and other allergic diseases. RESULTS We included 1038 children; of these, 506 were girls. The latent class analysis model with the best fit to PASTURE data separated 4 phenotypes of atopic dermatitis in childhood: 2 early phenotypes with onset before age 2 years (early transient [n=96; 9.2%] and early persistent [n=67; 6.5%]), the late phenotype with onset at age 2 years or older (n=50; 4.8%), and the never/infrequent phenotype (n=825; 79.5%), defined as children with no atopic dermatitis. Children with both parents with history of allergies were 5 times more at risk to develop atopic dermatitis with an early-persistent phenotype compared with children with parents with no history of allergies. Both early phenotypes were strongly associated with food allergy. The risk of developing asthma was significantly increased among the early-persistent phenotype (adjusted odds ratio, 2.87; 95%CI, 1.31-6.31). The late phenotype was only positively associated with allergic rhinitis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Using latent class analysis, 4 phenotypes of atopic dermatitis were identified depending on the onset and course of the disease. The prevalence of asthma and food allergy by 6 years of age was strongly increased among children with early phenotypes (within age 2 years), especially with persistent symptoms. These findings are important for the development of strategies in allergy prevention. © 2017 American Medical Association.

Methods: We examined the relationship between maternal dietary patterns assessed using 24-h recalls and food diaries at 26-28 weeks of pregnancy and the subsequent development of allergic outcomes in the offspring in the Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort. Exploratory factor analysis was used to characterize maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy. During repeated visits in the first 36 months of life, questionnaires were administered to ascertain allergic symptoms, namely, eczema, rhinitis, and wheeze. At ages 18 and 36 months, we administered skin-prick testing to inhalant and food allergens. Results: Of the 3 maternal dietary patterns that emerged, the seafood and noodles pattern was associated with a reduced risk of developing allergen sensitization at both 18 months (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.7 [0.5-0.9]) and 36 months (0.7 [0.6-0.9]) after adjustment for a family history of allergy, and ethnicity, sex, and maternal education levels. No associations between the patterns vegetables, fruit, and white rice or pasta, cheese, and processed meat were observed with any of the allergic outcomes in the first 18 and 36 months of life. Conclusion: Maternal diet during pregnancy can influence the subsequent development of allergic outcomes in offspring. © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

The aim of this study was to analyze in cluster a cohort of children allergic to peanuts and assessed for cross-reactivity to nuts and legumes and to identify different phenotypes. Methods: We included retrospectively 317 children with peanut allergy evaluated at the Allergy Unit of the Saint Vincent Hospital of Lille in the last 12 years. A complete workup for peanut allergy and nuts and legumes was carried out for each patient. A hierarchical agglomerative clustering method was used to search for clusters of individuals in the evaluated cohort. Results: Cross-allergy to TN and/or other legumes was identified in 137 patients (43.2%), atopic dermatitis being a major risk factor (adjusted OR = 16 [95% CI: 7.4–37]; p < 0.001). Three phenotypes emerged from cluster analysis. Cluster 1 (72 patients) is characterized by high level of rAra h 2, low threshold reactive doses for peanut and high proportion of asthma; Cluster 2 (93 patients) is characterized by high threshold reactive doses for peanut and the lowest proportion of cross-allergy to TN and/or legumes; Cluster 3 (152 patients) has a high risk of cross-allergy to TN and/or legumes and most patients suffer from eczema. Conclusions: The three phenotypes highlighted by this study could be useful to identify children with high risk of cross-allergic reaction to TNs and legumes early after PA diagnosis. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

To date, no prospective study has been published on the incidence and potential predictors of AD in South East Asian populations. The Indonesian Prospective Study of Atopic Dermatitis in Infants (ISADI) will address the genetic, metabolic and dietary characteristics of mothers and their offspring, as well as potential determinants of AD within the first year of infant life. Methods and analysis This prospective study will be undertaken in about 400 infants to investigate the direct and indirect effects of filaggrin (FLG) gene mutations, the genetic variants of FADS1, FADS2 and FADS3 and the role of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) on the development of AD. We will use standardised protocols for subject recruitment, umbilical artery plasma analysis, buccal cell sampling for genotyping, fatty acid analysis, physical exams, 3-day food-intake recall of mothers and children, as well as comprehensive questionnaires on environmental, socioeconomic and AD-related factors, including family history. Monthly monitoring by telephone and physical exams every 3â €..months will be carried out to assess participants' anthropometry, medical history and incidence of AD diagnosis during the first year of life. Hypotheses-driven analyses of quality-controlled dietary, genetic and metabolic data will be performed with state-of-The-Art statistical methods (eg, AD-event history, haplotype, dietary or metabolic factor analysis). Direct and indirect effects of genetics and LCPUFA in buccal cell and cord plasma glycerophospholipids as potential mediators of inflammation on AD development will be evaluated by path analysis.

Predicting disease progression and survival in IPF is important for treatment. We previously demonstrated that serum periostin has the potential to be a prognostic biomarker for IPF. Our aim was to use monomeric periostin in a multicenter study to evaluate its efficacy in diagnosing IPF and predicting its progression. To do so, we developed a new periostin kit to detect only monomeric periostin. The subjects consisted of 60 IPF patients in a multicenter cohort study. We applied monomeric periostin, total periostin detected by a conventional kit, and the conventional biomarkers -KL-6, SP-D, and LDH- to diagnose IPF and to predict its short-term progression as estimated by short-term changes of %VC and%DL,CO. Moreover, we compared the fraction ratios of monomeric periostin to total periostin in IPF with those in other periostin-high diseases: atopic dermatitis, systemic scleroderma, and asthma. Monomeric periostin showed the greatest ability to identify IPF comparable with KL-6 and SP-D. Both monomeric and total periostin were well correlated with the decline of %VC and %DL,CO. Clustering of IPF patients into high and low periostin groups proved useful for predicting the short-term progression of IPF. Moreover, the relative ratio of monomeric periostin was higher in IPF than in other periostin-high diseases. Measuring monomeric periostin is useful for diagnosing IPF and predicting its short-term progression. Moreover, the ratio of monomeric periostin to total periostin is elevated in IPF compared to other periostin-high diseases. © 2017 Ohta et al.

Objective: To create a model for selecting subjects in studies on SS by identifying a complete set of self-reported SS characteristics and factors discriminatively describing it. Methods: A survey (n = 3058) was conducted, comprising questions regarding socio-demographics, atopy, skin characteristics, personal care, degree of self-assessed SS and subjective and objective reactions to endogenous and exogenous factors. Exploratory factor analysis on 481 questionnaires was performed to identify underlying dimensions and multivariate logistic regression to find contributing variables to the likelihood of reporting SS. Results: The prevalence of SS was found to be 41%, and 56% of SS subjects reports a concomitant atopic condition. The most discriminative were the eliciting factors toiletries and emotions, and not specific skin symptoms in general. Conclusion: Triggers of different origins seem to elicit SS, it is not defined by concomitant skin diseases only, suggesting existence of ‘general’ SS. A multifactorial questionnaire could be a better diagnostic than a one-dimensional provocative test. © 2016 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",,"adolescent; adult; aged; allergic asthma; Article; atopic dermatitis; atopy; controlled study; emotion; female; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal; rhinoconjunctivitis; self concept; self evaluation; self report; skin allergy; skin care; skin manifestation; skin sensitivity; biological model; clothing; cold; hair removal; heat; middle aged; pathophysiology; perceptive threshold; skin; sunlight; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Clothing; Cold Temperature; Emotions; Female; Hair Removal; Hot Temperature; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Prevalence; Sensory Thresholds; Skin; Sunlight; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,"Mills, O.H., Jr., Berger, R.S., Defining the susceptibility of acne-prone and sensitive skin populations to extrinsic factors (1991) Dermatol Clin, 9, pp. 93-98; Muizzuddin, N., Marenus, K.D., Maes, D.H., Factors defining sensitive skin and its treatment (1998) Am J Contact Dermat, 9, pp. 170-175; Paquet, F., Pierard-Franchimont, C., Fumal, I., Goffin, V., Paye, M., Pierard, G.E., Sensitive skin at menopause; dew point and electrometric properties of the stratum corneum (1998) Maturitas, 28, pp. 221-227; Seidenari, S., Francomano, M., Mantovani, L., Baseline biophysical parameters in subjects with sensitive skin (1998) Contact Dermatitis, 38, pp. 311-315; Simion, A.F., Rau, A.H., Sensitive skin: what is it and how to formulate for it (1994) Cosmet Toiletries, 109, p. 43s; Farage, M.A., How do perceptions of sensitive skin differ at different anatomical sites?

Aim of this study was to translate, culturally adapt and validate the Dutch translation of the heiQ and to compare the results with the English, German and French translations. Methods: A systematic translation process was undertaken. Psychometric properties were studied among patients with arthritis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and asthma (n=286). Factorial validity using confirmatory factor analysis, item difficulty (D), item remainder correlation and composite reliability were conducted. Stability was tested using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: Items were well understood and only minor language adjustments were required. Confirmatory fit indices were >0.95 and item difficulty was D≥0.65 for all items in scales showing acceptable fit indices, except for the reversed Emotional distress scale. Composite reliability ranged between 0.67 and 0.85. Test-retest reliability (n=93) ICC varied between 0.61 and 0.84. Comparisons with other translations showed comparable fit indices. A lower ICC on Self-monitoring and insight scale was observed. Conclusions: The Dutch translation of the heiQ was found to be well understood and user friendly by patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Atopic Dermatitis, Food allergy and asthma and to have robust psychometric properties for evaluating the impact of health education and self-management programs.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression and modulate numerous biological processes. Little is known about the functions of miRNAs in IL-22/IL-17-producing T cells. Material and Methods: IL-22- and IL-17-positive T cells were sorted from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by intracellular staining and dual-secretion assay. miRNA expression profiles were detected with TaqMan array microfluidic cards. T cells were transfected with miRNA mimics. Gene expression was analyzed using RT-qPCR and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in T-cell subsets and PBMCs from patients with asthma and atopic dermatitis. Results: The increased expression of miR-323-3p and noncoding RNA nc886 and reduced expression of miR-93, miR-181a, miR-26a, and miR-874 were detected in IL-22-producing T cells. The pathway analysis of the putative targets suggested that these differentially expressed miRNAs could impact the proliferation, differentiation, and effector functions of T cells. Further analyses showed the highest expression for miR-323-3p in IL-22- and IL-17-double-positive T cells and its capacity to suppress multiple genes from the transforming growth factor-β pathway and the production of IL-22 in T cells. An increased expression of miR-323-3p in PBMCs from patients with asthma and reverse correlation between miR-323-3p levels and IL-22 production in PBMCs cultured in T-cell growth conditions was observed. Conclusions: Our data suggest that miR-323-3p acts in a negative feedback loop to control the production of IL-22 in IL-22/IL-17-producing T cells and might thus impact the T-cell responses in asthma. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship of polysensitization with allergic multimorbidities and the severity of allergic diseases. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of 3,368 Korean children aged 6-7 years-old. We defined IgE-mediated allergic diseases based on structured questionnaires, and classified the sensitivity to 18 aeroallergens by logistic regression and the Ward hierarchical clustering method. The relationship of polysensitization (positive IgE responses against 2 or more aeroallergens classes) with allergic multimorbidities (coexistence of 2 or more of the following allergic diseases: asthma, rhinitis, eczema, and conjunctivitis) and severity of allergic diseases was determined by ordinal logistic regression analysis. Results: The rate of polysensitization was 13.6% (n = 458, 95% CI 12.4-14.8) and that of allergic multimorbidity was 23.5% (n = 790, 95% CI 22.0-24.9). Children sensitized to more aeroallergens tended to have more allergic diseases (rho = 0.248, p < 0.001), although the agreement between polysensitization and multimorbidity was poor (kappa = 0.11, p < 0.001). The number allergen classes to which a child was sensitized increased the risk of wheezing attacks (1 allergen: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.22, 4 or more allergens: aOR 9.39), absence from school (1 allergen: aOR 1.96, 3 allergens: aOR 2.08), and severity of nasal symptoms (1 allergen: aOR 1.61, 4 or more allergens: aOR 4.38). Conclusion: Polysensitization was weakly related to multimorbidity. However, the number of allergens to which a child is sensitized is related to the severity of IgE-mediated symptoms. © 2017 S.

Using a case-control design in a Chinese sub-cohort of a Singaporean birth cohort (GUSTO), we utilised 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess intestinal microbial composition and diversity of 21 allergic and 18 healthy infants at 3 weeks, 3 months and 6 months of age, and correlated the microbiota with allergy at ages 18 and 36 months. Pronounced differences in intestinal microbiota composition between allergic and healthy infants were observed at 3 months of age. The intestine of healthy infants was colonised with higher abundance of commensal Bifidobacterium. Conversely, Klebsiella, an opportunistic pathogen, was significantly enriched in the allergic infants. Interestingly, infants with a high Klebsiella/Bifidobacterium (K/B) ratio (above the population median K/B ratio) at age 3 months had an odds ratio of developing allergy by 3 years of age of 9.00 (95% confidence interval 1.46-55.50) compared to those with low K/B ratio. This study demonstrated a relationship between the ratio of genera Klebsiella and Bifidobacterium during early infancy and development of paediatric allergy in childhood. Our study postulates that an elevated K/B ratio in early infancy could be a potential indicator of an increased risk of allergy development. This line of research might enable future intervention strategies in early life to prevent or treat allergy. Our study provides new insights into microbial signatures associated with childhood allergy, in particular, suggests that an elevated K/B ratio could be a potential early-life microbiota biomarker of allergic disease. © 2017 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","16S rRNA; Atopic dermatitis; Bifidobacterium spp; Eczema; Enterobacteriaceae","antibiotic agent; RNA 16S; bacterial DNA; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; 16S rRNA gene; allergy; Article; bacterial colonization; Bifidobacterium; case control study; child; childbirth; childhood disease; Chinese; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; developmental stage; disease association; disease course; female; gene sequence; high risk population; human; infancy; infant; intestine flora; Klebsiella; male; microbial diversity; nonhuman; population abundance; Singaporean; species composition; bacterial load; Bifidobacterium; biota; chemistry; cluster analysis; complication; DNA sequence; dysbiosis; follow up; genetics; hypersensitivity; isolation and purification; Klebsiella; newborn; phylogeny; preschool child; Singapore; Bacterial Load; Bifidobacterium; Biota; Case-Control Studies; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Dysbiosis; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Klebsiella; Male; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Singapore",,"DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",,,"289346, 613977

Objective: Identify peanut-allergic/sensitized phenotypes to personalize patient management. Methods: A combined factor and cluster analysis was used to study the phenotypes of 696 patients diagnosed with peanut sensitization and enrolled in the MIRABEL survey. The method was first applied to the 247 patients with an oral food challenge (OFC). It was then applied to the 449 patients without OFC to confirm the findings in an independent population. Results: Three independent clusters emerged from the OFC subgroup. Cluster 1, ‘Severe peanut allergy with little allergic multi-morbidity’ (123 subjects), had the highest proportion of patients with positive OFC (92%), a medium level of peanut protein inducing a positive OFC (235 mg), lower percentage of allergic multi-morbidity (2% asthma plus atopic dermatitis (A + AD), no cases of A + AD + multiple food allergies (MFA)). Cluster 2, ‘Severe peanut allergy with frequent allergic multi-morbidity’ (62 subjects), had a high proportion of patients with positive OFC (85%) with the lowest level of peanut protein inducing a positive OFC (112 mg), 89% allergic subjects, 100% with allergic multi-morbidity (A + AD) and 84% with A + AD + MFA. Cluster 3, ‘Mild peanut-allergic/sensitized phenotype’ (62 subjects), had the lowest mean age, the lowest proportion of patients with positive OFC (53%) with a high level of peanut protein inducing a positive OFC (770 mg), a low percentage of allergic multi-morbidity (48% A + AD + MFA). The two severe peanut-allergic phenotypes were more frequent in girls. The same clusters were found in the subgroup of patients without OFC. Conclusion & Clinical Relevance: Besides the classic markers associated with lower threshold doses of OFC (such as SPT and rAra h 2), allergic multi-morbidity and female gender should also be taken into account to better adapt the progressive dosage of provocation tests. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","asthma; atopic dermatitis; cluster analysis; gender; multi-morbidity; peanut allergy","Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child; cluster analysis; disease severity; factor analysis; female; food allergy; human; major clinical study; male; morbidity; peanut allergy; phenotype; priority journal; provocation test; sensitization; sex difference; adolescent; anaphylaxis; Arachis; immunology; peanut allergy; phenotype; preschool child; severity of illness index; sex difference; skin test; symptom assessment; allergen; immunoglobulin E; Adolescent; Allergens; Anaphylaxis; Arachis; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Male; Peanut Hypersensitivity; Phenotype; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Skin Tests; Symptom Assessment",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Allergens; Immunoglobulin E",,,"Medical Research Council, MRC: G1000758

Methods A cross-sectional study using multiple group analysis on the Korean panel data was used. A nationwide stratified multistage cluster sampling method was used and the survey was conducted in 2013 on 2,092 first-year middle school students in Korea. We used standardized instruments by the National Youth Policy Institute to measure peer attachment, parenting style, self-concept, and school adjustment. Multiple-group structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the difference of relations for peer attachment, parenting style, self-concept, and school adjustment variable between adolescents with chronic illness and those without chronic illness. Results The model fit of a multiple-group structural equation modeling was good. The difference of the path from negative parenting style to self-concept between the two groups was significant, and a significant between-group difference in the overall path was found. This indicated that self-concept in adolescents with chronic illness was more negatively affected by negative parenting style than in adolescents without chronic illness. Conclusions Healthcare providers can promote the process of school adjustment in several ways, such as discussing this issue directly with adolescent patients, along with their parents and peers, examining how the organization and content of the treatment can be modified according to the adolescents’ school life. © 2016","adolescent; chronic illness; parent-child relations; self concept","academic achievement; adolescent; adolescent health; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child parent relation; chronic disease; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; female; frustration; heart disease; human; major clinical study; male; middle school student; obesity; peer pressure; priority journal; rhinitis; self concept; stress; child parent relation; chronic disease; human relation; object relation; peer group; psychology; self concept; social adaptation; Adolescent; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Object Attachment; Parenting; Peer Group; Self Concept; Social Adjustment",,,,,,,,,,"Okumura, M.J., Saunders, M., Rehm, R.S., The role of health advocacy in transitions from pediatric to adult care for children with special health care needs: bridging families, provider and community services (2015) J Pediatr Nurs, 30 (5), pp. 714-723; Compas, B.E., Jaser, S.S., Dunn, M.J., Rodriguez, E.M., Coping with chronic illness in childhood and adolescence (2012) Annu Rev Clin Psychol, 8 (1), pp. 455-480; Hartling, L., Milne, A., Tjosvold, L., Wrightson, D., Gallivan, J., Newton, A.S., A systematic review of interventions to support siblings of children with chronic illness or disability (2014) J Paediatr Child Health, 50 (10), pp. E26-E38; Glodbeck, L., Holling, I., Schlack, R., West, C., Besier, T., The impact of an inpatient family-oriented rehabilitation program on parent-reported psychological symptoms of chronically ill children (2011) Klinische Pädiatrie, 223 (2), pp. 79-84; Murray, C.B., Amaro, C.M., Devine, K.A., Psihogios, A.M., Murphy, L.K., Holmbeck, G.N., Observed macro- and micro-level parenting behaviors during preadolescent family interactions as predictors of adjustment in emerging adults with and without spina bifida (2015) J Pediatr Psychol, 40 (1), pp. 18-32; Chang, Y.O., Associations between adolescent-perceived parenting styles and aggressive behavior (2014) Korean J Youth Stud, 21 (1), pp. 313-341; Bornstein, M.H., Hahn, C.S., Haynes, O.M., Social competence, externalizing, and internalizing behavioral adjustment from early childhood through early adolescence: developmental cascades (2010) Dev Psychopathol, 22 (4), pp. 717-735; Lindsay, S., Kingsnorth, S., Mcdougall, C., Keating, H., A systematic review of self-management interventions for children and youth with physical disabilities (2014) Disabil Rehabil, 36 (4), pp. 276-288; Kohut, S.A., Stinson, J., van Wyk, M., Giosa, L., Luca, S., Systematic review of peer support interventions for adolescents with chronic illness (2014) Int J Child Adolesc Health, 7 (3), pp. 183-197; Pinquart, M., Teubert, D., Academic, physical, and social functioning of children and adolescents with chronic physical illness: a meta-analysis (2012) J Pediatr Psychol, 37 (4), pp. 376-389; Chao, A.M., Minges, K.E., Park, C., Dumser, S., Murphy, K.M., Grey, M., General life and diabetes-related stressors in early adolescents with type 1 diabetes (2016) J Pediatr Health Care, 30 (2), pp. 133-142; Glenn, S., Cunningham, C., Evaluation of self by young people with Down syndrome (2001) Int J Disabil Dev Edu, 48 (2), pp. 163-177; Kingery, J.N., Erdley, C.A., Marshall, K.C., Peer acceptance and friendship as predictors of early adolescents’ adjustment across the middle school transition (2011) Merrill Palmer Q, 57 (3), pp. 215-243; Henry, K.L., Stanley, L.R., Edwards, R.W., Harkabus, L.C., Chapin, L.A., Individual and contextual effects of school adjustment on adolescent alcohol use (2009) Prev Sci, 10 (3), pp. 236-247; Armsden, G.C., Greenberg, M.T., The inventory of parent and peer attachment: Individual differences and their relationship to psychological well-being in adolescence (1987) J Youth Adolesc, 16 (5), pp. 427-454; Anderson, B.J., Parenting styles and parenting practices in pediatric diabetes (2011) Diabetes Care, 34 (8), pp. 1885-1886; Calafat, A., Gracia, F., Juan, M., Becoña, E., Fernández-Hermida, J.R., Which parenting style is more protective against adolescent substance use?

Objective By using a large prebirth cohort, this study aimed to identify sex-specific risk factors for wheeze from birth through midchildhood and identify distinct longitudinal wheeze phenotypes and the sex-specific risk factors associated with these phenotypes. Methods Mothers reported child wheeze symptoms over the past year approximately yearly on 9 occasions starting at age 1 year. We identified sex-specific predictors of wheeze, wheeze phenotypes, and sex-specific predictors of these phenotypes by using generalized estimating equations, latent class mixed models, and multinomial logistic analysis, respectively. Results A total of 1623 children had information on wheeze at 1 or more time points. Paternal asthma was a stronger predictor of ever wheezing in boys (odds ratio [OR], 2.15; 95% CI, 1.74-2.66) than in girls (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.19-1.96; P for sex by paternal asthma interaction = .03), whereas being black or Hispanic, birth weight for gestational age z score, and breast-feeding duration had stronger associations among girls. We identified 3 longitudinal wheeze phenotypes: never/infrequent wheeze (74.1%), early transient wheeze (12.7%), and persistent wheeze (13.1%). Compared with never/infrequent wheeze, maternal asthma, infant bronchiolitis, and atopic dermatitis were associated with persistent wheeze in both sexes, but paternal asthma was associated with persistent wheeze in boys only (OR, 4.27; 95% CI, 2.33-7.83; P for sex by paternal asthma interaction = .02), whereas being black or Hispanic was a predictor for girls only. Conclusion We identified sex-specific predictors of wheeze and longitudinal wheeze patterns, which might have important prognostic value and allow for a more personalized approach to wheeze and asthma treatment. © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Asthma; bronchiolitis; parental asthma; sex differences","abnormal respiratory sound; asthma; child; cohort analysis; female; follow up; human; infant; male; newborn; phenotype; preschool child; prevalence; prospective study; sex; sex difference; sexual development; United States; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Phenotype; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Respiratory Sounds; Sex; Sex Characteristics; Sex Factors; United States",,,,,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: R01HL064925

The miRNA expression profile of skin biopsies from patients with tumor stage MF (tMF) and normal donors was compared using miRNA microarrays. Overall, 154 miRNAs were found differentially expressed between tMF and the control cohort with the majority of them being up-regulated (57 %). Among the upregulated miRNAs, miR-3177, miR-514b-3p, miR-1267, and miR-1282 were exclusively detected in 70 % of tMF. Additional upregulated miRNAs included miR-34a, miR-29a, let-7a*, and miR-210, while miR-200c* was identified among the downregulated ones. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to further investigate the expression profiles of miR-34a and miR-29a and validated the overexpression of miR-34a. Enrichment studies revealed that the target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were important in several cancer-related signaling pathways. The overlapping relationship of the target genes among tMF, Sezary syndrome, and atopic dermatitis revealed several common and disease-specific genes. Collectively, our study modulated miR-34a as a candidate oncogenic molecule and miR-29a as a putative tumor suppressor highlighting their promising potential in the molecular pathogenesis of tMF. © 2016, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).","miRNA microarrays;

In human medicine, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is an analytical technique used for several diseases. It requires a small amount of sample and allows the identification of structural moieties of biomolecules on the basis of their infrared absorption, with limited sample pretreatment. Hypothesis/Objectives - The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of FTIR. Animals - Three groups were tested: 21 dogs with non food-induced CAD (NFICAD), 16 dogs with inflammatory conditions of various origins but without allergic dermatoses (OD) and 10 healthy dogs (H). Methods - Peripheral blood was collected and spectra were acquired with a FTIR spectrophotometer. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the full wavenumber spectra (4000-600/cm), followed by a Fisher discriminant analysis (DA) to assess the differences between the three groups. Results - The PCA followed by the DA of whole spectra showed significant differences between the three groups. These results suggest that by using the FTIR method, dogs with NFICAD can be differentiated from healthy dogs and dogs with nonallergic inflammation. There was no overlap between the spectral data of the three groups indicating that NFICAD dogs were correctly segregated from the H and OD groups. Conclusions - A study on a larger cohort including common pruritic skin diseases is necessary to confirm these initial results and the relevance of this diagnostic technique. © 2016 ESVD and ACVD.",,"animal; Dermatitis, Atopic; dog; Dog Diseases; female; food allergy; infrared spectroscopy; male; pilot study; veterinary; Animals; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Female; Food Hypersensitivity; Male; Pilot Projects; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared",,,,,,,,,,"Favrot, C., Steffan, J., Seewald, W., A prospective study on the clinical features of chronic canine atopic dermatitis and its diagnosis (2010) Vet Dermatol, 21, pp. 23-31; Willemse, T., Atopic skin disease: A review and a reconsideration of diagnostic criteria (1986) J Small Anim Pract, 27, pp. 771-778; Prélaud, P., Guaguére, E., Alhaidari, Z., Réévaluation des critéres de diagnostic de la dermatite atopique (1998) Rev Med Vet-Toulouse, 149, pp. 1057-1064; Kohn, E.C., Azad, N., Annunziata, C., Proteomics as a tool for biomarker discovery (2007) Dis Markers, 23, pp. 411-417; Fujioka, N., Morimoto, Y., Arai, T., Discrimination between normal and malignant human gastric tissues by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (2004) Cancer Detect Prev, 28, pp. 32-36; Petibois, C., Cazorla, G., Cassaigne, A., Plasma protein contents determined by Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (2001) Clin Chem, 47, pp. 730-738; Bellisola, G., Sorio, C., Infrared spectroscopy and microscopy in cancer research and diagnosis (2012) Am J Cancer Res, 2, pp. 1-21; Xie, Y.B., Liu, Q., He, F., Diagnosis of colon cancer with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on the malignant colon tissue samples (2011) Chin Med J, 124, pp. 2517-2521; Hanash, S.M., Pitteri, S.J., Faca, V.M., Mining the plasma proteome for cancer biomarkers (2008) Nature, 452, pp. 571-579; Chaerkady, R., Pandey, A., Applications of proteomics to lab diagnosis (2008) Annu Rev Pathol, 3, pp. 485-498; Li, X., Conklin, L., Alex, P., New serological biomarkers of inflammatory bowel disease (2008) World J Gastroenterol, 14, pp. 5115-5124; Li, Q.B., Sun, X.J., Xu, Y.Z., Use of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy to rapidly diagnose gastric endoscopic biopsies (2005) World J Gastroenterol, 11, pp. 3842-3845; Du, J.K., Shi, J.S., Sun, X.J., Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of gallbladder carcinoma cell line (2009) Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int, 8, pp. 75-78; Babrah, J., McCarthy, K., Lush, R.J., Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic studies of T-cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoid and myeloid leukaemia cell lines (2009) Analyst, 134, pp. 763-768; Haas, S.L., Bocker, U., Bugert, P., S1208 Application of Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy of serum samples in patients with inflammatory bowel disease-A pilot study (2008) Gastroenterol, 134. , (Abstract); Sakudo, A., Kuratsune, H., Kobayashi, T., Spectroscopic diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome by visible and near-infrared spectroscopy in serum samples (2006) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 345, pp. 1513-1516; Petibois, C., Cazorla, G., Déléris, G., FT-IR spectroscopy utilization to sportsmen fatigability evaluation and control (2000) Med Sci Sports Exerc, 32, pp. 1803-1808; Déléris, D., Petitbois, C., Applications of FT-IR spectrometry to plasma contents analysis and monitoring (2003) Vib Spectrosc, 32, pp. 123-136; Pucheu-Haston, C.M., Bizikova, P., Eisenschenk, M.N., Review: The role of antibodies, autoantigens and food allergens in canine atopic dermatitis (2015) Vet Dermatol, 26, pp. 115-130; Gould, H.J., Sutton, B.J., IgE in allergy and asthma today (2008) Nat Rev Immunol, 8, pp. 205-217; Jong, M.C., Hofker, M.H., Havekes, L.M., Role of ApoCs in lipoprotein metabolism: Functional differences between ApoC1, ApoC2, and ApoC3 (1999) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 19, pp. 472-484; Jong, M.C., Gijbels, M.J., Dahlmans, V.E., Hyperlipidemia and cutaneous abnormalities in transgenic mice overexpressing human apolipoprotein C1 (1998) J Clin Invest, 101, pp. 145-152; Nagelkerken, L., Verzaal, P., Lagerweij, T., Development of atopic dermatitis in mice transgenic for human apolipoprotein C1 (2008) J Invest Dermatol, 128, pp. 1165-1172","Bruet, V.; Dermatology Parasitology CE, Oniris, Atlanpole, CS 40706, France; email: vincent.bruet@oniris-nantes.fr",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",,,,,09594493,,,"27500559","English","Vet.

However, the association between processed food intake and AD has not been studied in a large adult population. Methods and Study Design: We investigated the association between dietary habits and AD in 17,497 adults in the 2009–2011 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Results: We identified 4 dietary patterns using principal components analysis of a 63-item food frequency questionnaire: the “traditional dietary pattern”, rich in rice and kimchi; the “processed food pattern”, with more meat, instant noodles, soda, and processed foods; the “healthy dietary pattern”, high in grains, vegetables, fruits, and seaweeds; and the “drinking dietary pattern”, mainly drinking coffee and alcohol. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for AD were calculated according to dietary patterns after adjusting for potential confounders with incorporation of sample weights for the complex sample design. The “meat and processed food” pattern was associated with a significant 1.57 fold higher OR for atopic dermatitis than the low consumption group. Further analysis revealed that the increased atopic dermatitis was most closely associated with instant noodles. In contrast, the groups with high intake of rice and kimchi exhibited lower ORs, 0.38 and 0.43 folds, compared to the low intake group. Conclusion: Consuming instant noodles, meat and processed foods was associated with increased prevalence of atopic dermatitis, whereas consuming rice and kimchi, and coffee was associated with decreased prevalence of atopic dermatitis. © 2016.

We aimed to investigate the mediating pathways and to search for the most prominent pathological mechanism between central obesity and childhood asthma. In the Taiwan Children Health Study, we collected data on an open cohort of children aged 9-13 years. Children's respiratory outcomes, atopic conditions, obesity measures and pulmonary function were surveyed annually between 2010 and 2012. Exhaled nitric oxide fraction concentrations were recorded in 2012. Generalised estimating equations and general linear models were used to examine the associations between central obesity, possible mediators and asthma. Structural equation models were applied to investigate the pathways that mediate the link between central obesity and asthma. Central obesity (waist-to-hip ratio) most accurately predicted childhood asthma. In the active asthma model, the percentage of mediation was 28.6% for pulmonary function, 18.1% for atopy and 5.7% for airway inflammation. The percentage of mediation for pulmonary function was 40.2% in the lifetime wheeze model.

Although the immune cell–IL-31–neuron axis has been implicated in severe pruritus during atopic skin inflammation, IL-31's neuropoietic potential remains elusive. Objective We sought to analyze the IL-31–related transcriptome in sensory neurons and to investigate whether IL-31 promotes sensory nerve fiber outgrowth. Methods In vitro primary sensory neuron culture systems were subjected to whole-transcriptome sequencing, ingenuity pathway analysis, immunofluorescence, and nerve elongation, as well as branching assays after IL-31 stimulation. In vivo we investigated the cutaneous sensory neuronal network in wild-type, Il31-transgenic, and IL-31 pump–equipped mice. Results Transgenic Il31 overexpression and subcutaneously delivered IL-31 induced an increase in the cutaneous nerve fiber density in lesional skin in vivo. Transcriptional profiling of IL-31–activated dorsal root ganglia neurons revealed enrichment for genes promoting nervous system development and neuronal outgrowth and negatively regulating cell death. Moreover, the growth cones of primary small-diameter dorsal root ganglia neurons showed abundant IL-31 receptor α expression. Indeed, IL-31 selectively promoted nerve fiber extension only in small-diameter neurons. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation mediated IL-31–induced neuronal outgrowth, and pharmacologic inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 completely abolished this effect. In contrast, transient receptor potential cation channel vanilloid subtype 1 channels were dispensable for IL-31–induced neuronal sprouting. Conclusions The pruritus- and TH2-associated novel cytokine IL-31 induces a distinct transcriptional program in sensory neurons, leading to nerve elongation and branching both in vitro and in vivo. This finding might help us understand the clinical observation that patients with atopic dermatitis experience increased sensitivity to minimal stimuli inducing sustained itch. © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","atopic dermatitis; cutaneous hyperinnervation; dorsal root ganglia; IL-31; IL-31 receptor α; nerve growth","interleukin 31; interleukin 31 receptor alpha; interleukin receptor; STAT3 protein; transcriptome; unclassified drug; vanilloid receptor 1; IL31 protein, human; interleukin derivative; STAT3 protein; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; basal ganglion; cell death; controlled study; gene expression; gene product; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nerve cell growth; nerve cell network; nerve elongation; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; pruritus; sensory nerve cell; Th2 cell; transcription elongation; transcription initiation; animal; cluster analysis; cytology; gene expression profiling; genetics; human; immunology; innervation; knockout mouse; metabolism; nerve fiber; phosphorylation; pruritus; sensory nerve cell; skin; spinal ganglion; Th2 cell; transgenic mouse; Animals; Cluster Analysis; Ganglia, Spinal; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Interleukins; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Nerve Fibers; Phosphorylation; Pruritus; Sensory Receptor Cells; Skin; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Th2 Cells",,"vanilloid receptor 1, 363242-41-5; IL31 protein, human; Interleukins; STAT3 Transcription Factor",,,"National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS: R01AR059402",,,,,"Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis (2008) N Engl J Med, 358, pp. 1483-1494; Eyerich, K., Novak, N., Immunology of atopic eczema: overcoming the Th1/Th2 paradigm (2013) Allergy, 68, pp. 974-982; Hamilton, J.D., Suárez-Fariñas, M., Dhingra, N., Cardinale, I., Li, X., Kostic, A., Dupilumab improves the molecular signature in skin of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (2014) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 134, pp. 1293-1300; Kabashima, K., New concept of the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis: interplay among the barrier, allergy, and pruritus as a trinity (2013) J Dermatol Sci, 70, pp. 3-11; Cevikbas, F., Steinhoff, A., Homey, B., Steinhoff, M., Neuroimmune interactions in allergic skin diseases (2007) Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol, 7, pp. 365-373; Tominaga, M., Takamori, K., Itch and nerve fibers with special reference to atopic dermatitis: therapeutic implications (2014) J Dermatol, 41, pp. 205-212; Emtestam, L., Hagströmer, L., Dou, Y.C., Sartorius, K., Johansson, O., PGP 9.5 distribution patterns in biopsies from early lesions of atopic dermatitis (2012) Arch Dermatol Res, 304, pp. 781-785; Urashima, R., Mihara, M., Cutaneous nerves in atopic dermatitis.

Methods: We analyzed data from the 2007–2008 National Survey of Children's Health including a representative sample of 91,642 children age 0–17 years and the 2006–2007 Environmental Protection Agency measurements of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrate (NO3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), organic carbon (OC), sulfate (SO3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM-2.5) and &lt;10 μm (PM-10), and tropospheric ozone levels, and the National Climate Data Center measurements of relative humidity (%), issued UV index, outdoor air temperature, and precipitation levels. Results: In multivariate survey logistic regression models controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, household income, US birthplace, and history of moving to a new location, eczema was associated with higher mean annual NO2 (p = 0.008), SO2 (p = 0.006), SO3 (p = 0.0002), arsenic (p = 0.0007), nickel (p = 0.0002), lead (p = 0.03), vanadium (p &lt; 0.0001), and zinc (p = 0.003), but lower NO3 (p = 0.002), OC (p = 0.03), PM-2.5 (p = 0.006), cadmium (p &lt; 0.0001), copper (p = 0.004), and potassium (p &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, moderate–severe eczema was associated with higher NO3 (p = 0.03), OC (p = 0.008) and PM-2.5 (p = 0.01), copper (p = 0.04), lead (p = 0.008), and zinc (p = 0.01), but lower CO (p = 0.03). Principal component analysis was used and identified 4 combinations of pollutants and climate factors occurring in the USA, of which 1 was associated with higher prevalence and two were associated with lower prevalences of eczema (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Pollutants in conjunction with climate factors may differentially impact eczema prevalence and severity, some with apparent harmful effects. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, no scale of this kind exists in Japan. The aims of this study were to validate the Japanese Culturally Modified Version of the CADIS (JCMV-CADIS) and to describe the family impact of children with AD in a Japanese context. Methods Participants included primary-caregivers for children with AD between 2 and 6 years of age. Interviews were conducted, and new items for the Japanese version were drafted. Reliability and validity were evaluated and compared with the original CADIS, and unique features of the Japanese version were analyzed. Results Exploratory factor analysis revealed the following factors: “Symptoms” and “Activity Limitations and Behavior” in the Child domain, and “Emotions Related to Social Factors,” “Emotions Related to the Child's Condition,” “Family and Social Function,” “Complexity of Care,” and “Approaches to Management of AD in Daily Life” in the Parent domain. The latter two factors were unique to the JCMV-CADIS and were not derived from the Original. “Emotion” was split into two independent factors. All factors showed good reliability (internal consistency and stability) and validity (concurrent validity and discriminant validity), except for the concurrent validity of “Approaches to Management of AD in Daily Life.” This factor seemed to reflect characteristics similar to the family-related function. Conclusions The JCMV-CADIS is a QoL scale developed for Japanese children with AD and their families. Further evaluation of clinical applicability is needed. © 2016 Japanese Society of Allergology","Atopic dermatitis; Child; Family; Quality of life; Reliability and validity","allergic conjunctivitis; allergic rhinitis; allergy; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; caregiver; child; Childhood Atopic Dermatitis Impact Scale; concurrent validity; Dermatitis Family Impact; discriminant validity; emotion; exploratory factor analysis; family; Family Assessment Inventory; female; food allergy; human; interview; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; Parenting Stress Short Form; preschool child; priority journal; questionnaire; Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis; social status; comorbidity; cultural anthropology; Dermatitis, Atopic; health survey; Japan; quality of life; reproducibility; risk factor; severity of illness index; Caregivers; Child; Child, Preschool; Comorbidity; Culture; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Population Surveillance; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index",,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 26861933",,,,,"Eichenfield, L.F., Tom, W.L., Chamlin, S.L., Feldman, S.R., Hanifin, J.M., Simpson, E.L., Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1.

Objective We sought to assess short (4 weeks) and long-term (16 weeks) application of topical glucocorticosteroids on AD skin and define response biomarkers. Methods The effects of triamcinolone acetonide cream 0.025% were assessed based on gene expression and immunohistochemistry studies at baseline, 4 weeks, and 16 weeks in biopsy specimens from 15 patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Results At 16 weeks, only 3 patients were clinical responders (by using SCORAD50 criteria), but 6 patients qualified as responders based on histologic criteria. Baseline characteristics indicated more severe disease in nonresponders. While 3 of 15 patients experienced only transient benefit after 4 weeks, others showed progressive improvements toward 16 weeks. Topical glucocorticosteroid use in patients with AD resulted in improvements of the AD genomic signature of 25.6% at 4 weeks and 71.8% at 16 weeks, respectively, and even 123.9% in the histologic responder group. Cytokines (IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-22, CCL17, CCL18, peptidase inhibitor 3 [PI3]/elafin, and S100As) showed consistent decreases from baseline toward 16 weeks with corresponding improvements in epidermal disease hallmarks (keratin 16 and loricrin) in lesional skin from responders (P < .05). Nonresponders largely showed lesser/nonsignificant reductions in key inflammatory and barrier markers (keratin 16, IL-13, IL-22, CCL17, CCL18, PI3/elafin, S100As, and loricrin). The combination of IL-21 and IFN-γ baseline expression closely predicted individual clinical glucocorticosteroid responses at 16 weeks of treatment. Conclusion Our study indicates that even low-potency glucocorticosteroids can broadly affect immune and barrier responses in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, associating higher baseline severity with increased steroid resistance in patients with AD. © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Atopic dermatitis; epidermal; immune; topical glucocorticosteroids; triamcinolone acetonide","calgranulin A; chemokine CCL18; CXCL9 chemokine; cytokeratin 16; eotaxin 3; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; interferon regulatory factor 1; interleukin 12p40; interleukin 13; interleukin 17; interleukin 21; interleukin 22; interleukin 23p19; interleukin 34; loricrin; macrophage derived chemokine; macrophage elastase; peptidase inhibitor 3; protein S 100; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; triamcinolone acetonide; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory agent; steroid; adult; aged; antiinflammatory activity; Article; atopic dermatitis; cell infiltration; clinical article; clinical trial (topic); down regulation; female; gene expression; histology; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; inflammatory cell; male; priority journal; skin biopsy; steroid therapy; treatment response; biopsy; cluster analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; drug effects; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; immunology; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; severity of illness index; skin; T lymphocyte subpopulation; time factor; topical drug administration; treatment outcome; young adult; Administration, Topical; Adult; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Biopsy; Cluster Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Severity of Illness Index; Skin; Steroids; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",,"gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; gamma interferon inducible protein 10, 97741-20-3; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; interleukin 21, 251100-02-4, 510787-82-3, 542817-56-1; interleukin 22, 457106-70-6, 478219-35-1, 554460-75-2; macrophage elastase; thymus and activation regulated chemokine, 181532-29-6; triamcinolone acetonide, 76-25-5; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Steroids",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

Objective To identify rhinitis phenotypes in school aged children and to predict the prognosis for developing bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and asthma. Methods This prospective follow-up study involved schoolchildren from the Children's Health and Environment Research cohort with current rhinitis, which was defined based on parental-reported, physician-diagnosed rhinitis and symptoms of rhinitis in the previous 12 months. All participants were followed up at 2 and 4 years later. Rhinitis clusters were identified by latent class analysis that used demographic, clinical, and environmental variables. Results In 512 eligible children (age range, 6–8 years), 4 rhinitis phenotypes were identified: cluster 1 (25% of children) was associated with nonatopy and a low socioeconomic status; cluster 2 (36%) was associated with a high-atopic burden but normal lung function; cluster 3 (22%) was associated with a high-atopic burden and impaired lung function; and cluster 4 (17%) was associated with low atopy and a high socioeconomic status. Cluster 3 was associated with the highest total serum IgE levels and blood eosinophil percentages at enrollment and the highest incidence of new cases of BHR (P =.04) and asthma symptoms (P =.005) during follow-up. Conclusion The rhinitis cluster of schoolchildren with atopy and impaired lung function is associated with allergic march. This identification of distinct rhinitis phenotypes in affected children may help to prevent allergic march in children with rhinitis. © 2016 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",,"immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; bronchus hyperreactivity; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; eosinophil count; female; follow up; food allergy; human; immunoglobulin blood level; lung disease; major clinical study; male; phenotype; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; social status; asthma; blood; Bronchial Hyperreactivity; complication; health survey; immunology; lung function test; phenotype; preschool child; prevalence; rhinitis; risk factor; South Korea; Asthma; Bronchial Hyperreactivity; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Male; Phenotype; Prevalence; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Public Health Surveillance; Republic of Korea; Respiratory Function Tests; Rhinitis; Risk Factors",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Immunoglobulin E",,,,,,,,"Meltzer, E.O., Blaiss, M.S., Derebery, M.J., Burden of allergic rhinitis: results from the Pediatric Allergies in America survey (2009) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 124, pp. S43-S70; Kim, W.K., Kwon, J.W., Seo, J.H., Interaction between IL13 genotype and environmental factors in the risk for allergic rhinitis in Korean children (2012) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 130, pp. 421-426.e425; Rochat, M.K., Illi, S., Ege, M.J., Allergic rhinitis as a predictor for wheezing onset in school-aged children (2010) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 126, pp. 1170-1175.e1172; Khanna, P., Shah, A., Categorization of patients with allergic rhinitis: a comparative profile of “sneezers and runners” and “blockers” (2005) Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol, 94, pp. 60-64; Eriksson, J., Bjerg, A., Lotvall, J., Rhinitis phenotypes correlate with different symptom presentation and risk factor patterns of asthma (2011) Respir Med, 105, pp. 1611-1621; Cingi, C., Catli, T., Phenotyping of allergic rhinitis (2012) Curr Allergy Asthma Rep, 12, pp. 115-119; Zheng, T., Yu, J., Oh, M.H., Zhu, Z., The atopic march: progression from atopic dermatitis to allergic rhinitis and asthma (2011) Allergy Asthma Immunol Res, 3, pp. 67-73; Ciprandi, G., Cirillo, I., The lower airway pathology of rhinitis (2006) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 118, pp. 1105-1109; Ekback, M., Tedner, M., Devenney, I., Severe eczema in infancy can predict asthma development: a prospective study to the age of 10 years (2014) PLoS One, 9, p. e99609; Kim, B.J., Kwon, J.W., Seo, J.H., Association of ozone exposure with asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic sensitization (2011) Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol, 107, pp. 214-219.e211; Kim, B.J., Seo, J.H., Jung, Y.H., Air pollution interacts with past episodes of bronchiolitis in the development of asthma (2013) Allergy, 68, pp. 517-523; Hong, S.J., Lee, M.S., Sohn, M.H., Self-reported prevalence and risk factors of asthma among Korean adolescents: 5-year follow-up study, 1995-2000 (2004) Clin Exp Allergy, 34, pp. 1556-1562; Miller, M.R., Hankinson, J., Brusasco, V., Standardisation of spirometry (2005) Eur Respir J, 26, pp. 319-338; Kim, B.J., Lee, S.Y., Kwon, J.W., Traffic-related air pollution is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness (2014) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 133, pp. 1763-1765.e1762; Crapo, R.O., Casaburi, R., Coates, A.L., Guidelines for methacholine and exercise challenge testing-1999 (2000) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 161, pp. 309-329; Siroux, V., Basagana, X., Boudier, A., Identifying adult asthma phenotypes using a clustering approach (2011) Eur Respir J, 38, pp. 310-317; Hagenaars, J.A., McCutcheon, A.L., Applied Latent Class Analysis (2002), Cambridge University Press Cambridge, MA; Bachert, C., van Cauwenberge, P., Olbrecht, J., van Schoor, J., Prevalence, classification and perception of allergic and nonallergic rhinitis in Belgium (2006) Allergy, 61, pp. 693-698; Singh, G.K., Siahpush, M., Kogan, M.D., Disparities in children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the United States, 2007 (2010) Pediatrics, 126, pp. 4-13; Kurukulaaratchy, R.J., Zhang, H., Patil, V., Identifying the heterogeneity of young adult rhinitis through cluster analysis in the Isle of Wight birth cohort (2015) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 135, pp. 143-150; Lee, B.E., Ha, E.H., Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke among South Korean adults: a cross-sectional study of the 2005 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011) Environ Health, 10, p. 29; Bolte, G., Fromme, H., Group GMES, Socioeconomic determinants of children's environmental tobacco smoke exposure and family's home smoking policy (2009) Eur J Public Health, 19, pp. 52-58; Jaakkola, N., Ruotsalainen, R., Jaakkola, J.J., What are the determinants of children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke at home?

The aims of this study were to determine AD phenotypes in school-age children and investigate their associations with the allergic march in each cluster. Methods We included 242 children (6-8 years) with current AD from the Children's HEalth and Environmental Research study, a 4-year prospective follow-up study with 2-year survey intervals. Latent class analysis was used. Serum IL-13 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) levels at the time of enrollment were measured using ELISA. Results We identified four current AD phenotypes in children, characterized as 'early onset with low atopy' (26.4% of the sample; group 1), 'early onset with high atopy and high eosinophil percentages' (48.3%; group 2), 'late onset with low atopy' (9.9%; group 3), and 'late onset with high atopy and normal eosinophils' (15.3%; group 4). Although groups 2 and 4 demonstrated high atopic burden, children in group 2 showed the persistence of AD and eosinophilia associated with a high prevalence of new cases of bronchial hyper-responsiveness and asthma symptoms during follow-up. The serum IL-13 level was significantly increased in the early-onset AD groups, but there was no significant difference in the serum TSLP levels across all four groups. Conclusion An allergic march-associated AD phenotype exists that is characterized by early onset of AD with its persistence, increased serum IL-13 levels, high atopy, and a persistently increased blood eosinophil percentage. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, the correspondence between different phenotypic clusters and differences in the underlying molecular mechanisms of asthma pathogenesis remains unclear. Objective We sought to determine whether clinical differences among children with asthma in different phenotypic clusters corresponded to differences in levels of gene expression. Methods We explored differences in gene expression profiles of CD4+ lymphocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of 299 young adult participants in the Childhood Asthma Management Program study. We obtained gene expression profiles from study subjects between 9 and 14 years of age after they participated in a randomized, controlled longitudinal study examining the effects of inhaled anti-inflammatory medications over a 48-month study period, and we evaluated the correspondence between our earlier phenotypic cluster analysis and subsequent follow-up clinical and molecular profiles. Results We found that differences in clinical characteristics observed between subjects assigned to different phenotypic clusters persisted into young adulthood and that these clinical differences were associated with differences in gene expression patterns between subjects in different clusters. We identified a subset of genes associated with atopic status, validated the presence of an atopic signature among these genes in an independent cohort of asthmatic subjects, and identified the presence of common transcription factor binding sites corresponding to glucocorticoid receptor binding. Conclusion These findings suggest that phenotypic clusters are associated with differences in the underlying pathobiology of asthma. Further experiments are necessary to confirm these findings. © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","asthma phenotypes; Childhood asthma; gene expression profiling; longitudinal study; microarray analysis","adducin 3; glucocorticoid receptor; histone deacetylase 2; immunoglobulin E; methacholine; protein; purinergic receptor P2Y, G protein coupled, 10 protein; solute carrier family 33, member 1 protein; spermidine synthase; transcription factor; unclassified drug; immunoglobulin E; transcriptome; adolescent; adult; airway obstruction; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; binding site; CD4+ T lymphocyte; child; clinical feature; cohort analysis; down regulation; eosinophil count; female; follow up; gene expression; gene expression profiling; human; human cell; immunoglobulin blood level; major clinical study; male; microarray analysis; phenotype; predictive value; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; respiratory tract allergy; smoking; spirometry; upregulation; asthma; blood; eosinophil; gene expression profiling; genetics; immediate type hypersensitivity; immunology; metabolism; pathophysiology; randomized controlled trial (topic); Adolescent; Asthma; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Child; Eosinophils; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Hypersensitivity, Immediate; Immunoglobulin E; Male; Phenotype; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Spirometry; Transcriptome",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; methacholine, 55-92-5; protein, 67254-75-5; spermidine synthase, 37277-82-0, 67016-02-8; Immunoglobulin E",,,"National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA: P30DA035778

Objective Although aberrant interactions between gut microbes and the intestinal immune system have been implicated in this skin disease, the nature of the microbiome dysfunction underlying the disease remains unclear. Methods The gut microbiome from 132 subjects, including 90 patients with AD, was analyzed by using 16S rRNA gene and metagenome sequence analyses. Reference genomes from the Human Microbiome Project and the KEGG Orthology database were used for metagenome analyses. Short-chain fatty acids in fecal samples were compared by using gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses. Results We show that enrichment of a subspecies of the major gut species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is strongly associated with AD. In addition, the AD microbiome was enriched in genes encoding the use of various nutrients that could be released from damaged gut epithelium, reflecting a bloom of auxotrophic bacteria. Fecal samples from patients with AD showed decreased levels of butyrate and propionate, which have anti-inflammatory effects. This is likely a consequence of an intraspecies compositional change in F prausnitzii that reduces the number of high butyrate and propionate producers, including those related to the strain A2-165, a lack of which has been implicated in patients with Crohn disease. Conclusions The data suggest that feedback interactions between dysbiosis in F prausnitzii and dysregulation of gut epithelial inflammation might underlie the chronic progression of AD by resulting in impairment of the gut epithelial barrier, which ultimately leads to aberrant TH2-type immune responses to allergens in the skin. © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","Atopic dermatitis; dysbiosis; Faecalibacterium prausnitzii; gut microbiota; microbiome","butyric acid; propionic acid; RNA 16S; RNA 16S; antiinflammatory activity; Article; atopic dermatitis; Bifidobacterium; controlled study; Crohn disease; dysbiosis; Faecalibacterium prausnitzii; human; intestine epithelium; intestine flora; Lactobacillus; major clinical study; mass fragmentography; metagenome; microbial diversity; phylogenetic tree; priority journal; biological model; biology; classification; Clostridiales; cluster analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; DNA sequence; feces; female; genetics; male; metabolism; metagenomics; microbiology; phylogeny; procedures; Clostridiales; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dysbiosis; Feces; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Male; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Models, Biological; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA",,"butyric acid, 107-92-6, 156-54-7, 461-55-2; propionic acid, 72-03-7, 79-09-4; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",,,,,,,,"Eichenfield, L.F., Tom, W.L., Chamlin, S.L., Feldman, S.R., Hanifin, J.M., Simpson, E.L., Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: Section 1.

Methods: A nationwide, cross-sectional study was conducted in children aged 6-7 years and adolescents aged 12-13 years who were randomly selected. Information was obtained through a Korean version of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire (ISAAC), and skin prick tests were performed. AD-diagnosed children were selected for risk factor analysis by using logistic regression. Results: We enrolled 4,003 children (M/F=2,021/ 1,982) in aged 6-7 years and 4,112 children (M/F=2,029/2,083) in 12-13 years. In children aged 6-7 years, the lifetime prevalence of AD diagnosis was 35.6% (N=1,424). On the other hand, in the 12 to 13 year age group, the lifetime prevalence of AD diagnosis was 24.2% (N=981). In the univariate logistic regression analysis in 6- 7 year-old children, possible risk factors were atopy, a parental history of allergic disease, the use of antibiotics during infancy, a history of having moved into a newly built house during infancy, the presence of visible mould in the house, and remodelling of house within 12 months. The statistical significance persisted after adjustment. However, antibiotic use during infancy and remodelling within 12 months showed no statistical significance as a risk factor for AD. In contrast, multivariate logistic regression analysis in adolescents demonstrated that female sex, atopy, a parental history of allergic diseases, the presence of visible mould in the house, and a history of having moved into a newly built house during infancy was associated with AD. There was no significant association between AD and other risk factors. Conclusion: In Korean schoolchildren, risk factors such as atopy, the presence of parental allergic diseases, moving into a newly built house during infancy and visible mould in the house were associated with AD. © 2016, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

Objective: The objective of this study was to explore potential differences in caregiver QoL between self-selected caregivers reporting a child with food allergy (SS) and caregivers with children followed at a food allergy referral center clinic (RC). Methods: The Food Allergy Quality of Life Parental Burden (FAQL-PB) index and screening questions regarding the child's most severe food reaction were administered to caregivers of milk, egg, peanut, or tree nut allergic children. SS were recruited via the email and/or social media networks of 2 large national food allergy advocacy groups, and RC from a tertiary referral center specialty clinic. Results: Among 2003 SS and 305 RC, the mean total FAQL-PB QoL score was 2.67. Compared with SS, RC had a lower (better) mean total QoL score (1.84 vs 2.81, P < .001), individual FAQL-PB domain scores (mean difference range 0.51-1.93; all P < .001), and lower QoL scores for all allergens (mean difference range 0.89-1.32; peanut P < .001, tree nut P < .001, milk P = .006, egg P = .001). In an adjusted multiple linear regression model, RC were associated with a lower QoL score (-1.6 [95% CI, -1.91 to -1.29], P < .001). Factor analysis of the index revealed 2 dimensions. A minimal clinically important difference of 0.3 was calculated for the FAQL-PB using the standard error of measurement method. Conclusions: Caregiver food allergy QoL is heterogeneous, and worse among SS versus RC. Clinically and statistically significant differences were noted in the total, domain-specific, and allergen-specific QoL scores, which indicated that the food allergic population may be segmented and have different risk profiles and/or burdens of illness, despite a common diagnosis. © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","Anaphylaxis; Epinephrine; Food allergy; Food Allergy Quality of Life-Parental Burden; Prevalence; Quality of life; Self-efficacy; Self-reported food allergy","allergen; immunoglobulin E; adult; anaphylaxis; Article; atopic dermatitis; caregiver; caregiver burden; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; e-mail; egg allergy; food allergy; Food Allergy Quality of Life Parental Burden; Food Allergy Self Efficacy Questionnaire; health center; human; milk allergy; nut allergy; peanut allergy; psychometry; quality of life; quality of life assessment; questionnaire; risk factor; self report; sensitization; social media; specialty clinic; tertiary health care; tree nut allergy; validation study; comparative study; female; Food Hypersensitivity; hospital; male; patient care; patient referral; population group; preschool child; prospective study; statistics and numerical data; Caregivers; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Food Hypersensitivity; Hospitals, Special; Humans; Male; Patient-Centered Care; Population Groups; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Referral and Consultation; Tertiary Healthcare",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

We hypothesized that the prevalence of AD is associated with the different dietary patterns and fermented food intakes of the Korean adult population. We examined the hypothesis using 9763 adults 19 years or older using the 2012-2013 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We identified 4 dietary patterns in addition to that including fermented foods using principal component analysis on data obtained from a 116-item validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire: meat and processed foods; vegetables, fruits, legumes, seafood, and seaweed; rice and grains; and coffee, chocolate, and ice cream. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for AD were calculated according to dietary patterns after adjusting for potential confounders. High levels of consumption (>92 times/month) of fermented foods such as doenjang, chungkookjang, kimchi, fermented seafood, makgeolli, and beer were associated with a lower prevalence of AD (OR, 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.84). In contrast, high levels of consumption of meat and processed foods were strongly associated with the prevalence of AD (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.48-3.94). Interestingly, the consumption of coffee, chocolate, and ice cream was significantly negatively associated with the prevalence of AD (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34-0.82). In conclusion, the hypothesis was accepted. The results can be applied to nutrition education programs for the general population to decrease risk factors for AD. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Atopic dermatitis; Fermented foods; Meats; Processed foods; Vegetables","adult; aged; Article; atopic dermatitis; beer; cacao; coffee; controlled study; diet; education program; female; fermented product; food frequency questionnaire; food intake; fruit; grain; human; ice cream; kimchi; legume; major clinical study; makgeolli; male; meat; nutrient; principal component analysis; priority journal; rice; risk factor; sea food; seaweed; South Korean; vegetable; adverse effects; cross-sectional study; Dermatitis, Atopic; diet; ethnology; feeding behavior; fermentation; functional food; health survey; microbiology; middle aged; population dynamics; prevalence; South Korea; trends; Western diet; young adult; coffee; Adult; Aged; Cacao; Coffee; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Diet; Diet, Western; Feeding Behavior; Fermentation; Functional Food; Health Surveys; Health Transition; Humans; Ice Cream; Meat; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Principal Component Analysis; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; Young Adult",,"Coffee",,,"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE","The authors thank John Robert Dickson, at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA, for his valuable comments.

This study aimed to give specific estimates for the heritability of childhood asthma and other allergic diseases, to attempt to replicate findings from genomewide association studies (GWAS) for childhood asthma and to test the same variants against other allergic diseases. Methods In a cohort of 25 306 Swedish twins aged 9 or 12 years, data on asthma were available from parental interviews and population-based registers. The interviews also inquired about wheeze, hay fever, eczema, and food allergy. Through structural equation modeling, the heritability of all phenotypes was calculated. A subset of 10 075 twins was genotyped for 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from previous GWAS; these were first tested for association with asthma and significant findings also against the other allergic diseases. Results The heritability of any childhood asthma was 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.85). For the other allergic diseases, the range was approximately 0.60-0.80. Associations for six SNPs with asthma were replicated, including rs2305480 in the GSDMB gene (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.86, P = 1.5∗10-8; other significant associations all below P = 3.5∗10-4). Of these, only rs3771180 in IL1RL1 was associated with any other allergic disease (for hay fever, OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53-0.77, P = 2.5∗10-6). Conclusion Asthma and allergic diseases of childhood are highly heritable, and these high-risk genetic variants associated specifically with childhood asthma, except for one SNP shared with hay fever. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Claudin-1, a protein present in tight junctions, is associated with many skin conditions. Our aim was to investigate expression levels of claudin-1 and atopic signature cytokines in atopic and normal dog skins. The affected skin showed significantly decreased intensity and epidermal distribution of claudin-1 compared to the normal control skin (P < 0.05). The CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ T cell subsets, eosinophils, and neutrophils infiltrated the affected epidermis and dermis. The CD3+/CD4+ T cell subsets in lesional skin were significantly higher than CD3+/CD8+ T cell subsets. CLDN-1 mRNA expression was markedly downregulated in the lesional skin, while IL-17A was upregulated in both lesional and nonlesional skin. IL-4 and IL-31 mRNA was upregulated in the lesional skin, and TNF-α mRNA was significantly upregulated in the nonlesional skin (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Correlation-based hierarchical clustering showed that CLDN-1 expression was closely clustered with IL-31 but loosely clustered with L-4, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-17A. We suggest that the alteration of claudin-1 in atopic dogs may disrupt the skin barrier and allow an influx of allergens, inciting inflammatory cytokine responses.","Canine atopic dermatitis; Claudin-1;

A recent phase II/III study has demonstrated the success of propranolol for involution of infantile hemangioma as well as a better efficacy and safety when indirectly compared with corticosteroids. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-utility of propranolol (Hemangiol), a new medicinal product and the first to be authorized for this specific paediatric indication, versus corticosteroids in the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma requiring systemic therapy. Methods: A life-time mixed decision tree and Markov model was developed to describe the pathway of infants with infantile hemangioma and to assess costs and outcomes in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. Clinical inputs were derived from the MA holder’s pivotal trial and literature review, and were validated by disease key opinion leaders in Italy. The economic evaluation considered direct medical costs associated with infantile hemangioma, derived from public sources. Atopic dermatitis utilities were used as a proxy for infantile hemangioma. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate model parameter variabilities. Results: The cumulative costs were €2,399.32 and €1,859.68, while cumulative QALYs were 19.11 and 18.95, respectively for propranolol and corticosteroids (Prednisolone-Deltacortene), corresponding to an incremental cost-utility ratio of €3,372.75 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that 94.60% of the 1,000 iterations fall within an a priori €30,000/QALY cost-effectiveness threshold. Conclusions: Propranolol oral solution for the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma requiring systemic therapy can be considered cost-effective compared to corticosteroids from the Italian National Health Service (NHS) perspective at a threshold fixed at €30,000/QALY. © 2015, The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,"Izadpanah, A., Kanevsky, J., Belzile, E., Propranolol versus Corticosteroids in the treatment of infantile hemangioma: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2013) Plast Reconstr Surg, 131 (3), pp. 601-613. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXjtF2mtLg%3D, PID: 23142941; Bertrand, J., McCuaig, C., Dubois, J., Hatami, A., Ondrejchak, S., Powell, J., Propranolol versus Prednisone in the treatment of infantile hemangiomas: a retrospective comparative study (2011) Ped Dermatol, 28, pp. 649-654; Bauman, N., McCarter, R., Guzzetta, P., Propranolol vs Prednisolone for symptomatic proliferating infantile hemangiomas.

However, there is also considerable variation in the list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) reported by different groups and the exact cause of AD is still not fully understood. Using a rank-based approach, we analyzed gene expression data from five different microarray studies, comprising a total of 127 samples and more than 250,000 transcripts. A total of 89 AD gene expression signatures '89ADGES', including FLG gene, were identified to show dysregulation consistently across these studies. Using a Support Vector Machine, we showed that the '89ADGES' discriminates AD from normal skin with 98% predictive accuracy. Functional annotation of these genes implicated their roles in immune responses (e.g., betadefensin, microseminoprotein), keratinocyte differentiation/epidermal development (e.g., FLG, CORIN, AQP, LOR, KRT16), inflammation (e.g., IL37, IL27RA, CCL18) and lipid metabolism (e.g., AKR1B10, FAD7, FAR2). Subsequently, we validated a subset of signature genes using quantitative PCR in a mouse model. Using a bioinformatic approach, we identified keratinocyte pathway over-represented (P = <0.0006) among the 89 signature genes. Keratinocytes are known to play a major role in barrier function due to their location in the epidermis. Our result suggests that besides immune-mediated pathway, skin barrier pathways such as the keratinocyte differentiation pathway play a key role in AD pathogenesis. A better understanding of the role of keratinocytes in AD will be important for developing novel ""barrier therapy"" for this disease. © 2015 Ghosh et al.

Self-efficacy is a key factor influencing effective chronic disease management, yet there are no published scales to measure parental self-efficacy in managing childhood eczema. The Parental Self-Efficacy with Eczema Care Index (PASECI) was designed to measure parental self-efficacy in managing childhood eczema as a pre- and postintervention tool in the evaluation of a structured Eczema Education Programme (EEP). Objectives To develop and test the validity, reliability and sensitivity of a new outcome measure (PASECI) designed to assess parental self-efficacy in managing their child's eczema to determine pre- vs. postintervention changes in educational intervention evaluation studies. Methods PASECI was developed from the literature, expert consultation and piloting of a 40-item prototype. The final 29-item scale is arranged in four subscales. Parents of children with eczema aged 0-16 years (n = 242) attending the EEP were assessed at 1 week pre-EEP and 4 weeks postintervention. Cronbach's α and factor analyses were undertaken. Results PASECI has face, content and construct validity. It is reliable, with high item internal consistency (α > 0·87 in all domains). Factor analysis revealed four viable domains. It was sensitive to change for postintervention measures using sign tests (P < 0·001). Conclusions PASECI is a useful, valid, reliable and sensitive evaluative outcome measure of self-efficacy in parents managing childhood eczema. © 2015 British Association of Dermatologists.",,"adolescent; Article; assessment of humans; atopic dermatitis; child; childhood disease; construct validity; content validity; controlled study; disease severity; education program; face validity; factorial analysis; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; Parental Self Efficacy with Eczema Care Index; primary medical care; priority journal; program evaluation; quality of life; questionnaire; sensitivity analysis; validation process; Dermatitis, Atopic; infant; newborn; parent; preschool child; psychology; reproducibility; self concept; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Parents; Reproducibility of Results; Self Efficacy; Treatment Outcome",,,,,,,,,,"McHenry, P.M., Williams, H.C., Bingham, E.A., Management of atopic eczema (1995) BMJ, 310, pp. 843-847; Lawson, V., Lewis-Jones, M.S., Finlay, A.Y., The family impact of childhood atopic dermatitis: The Dermatitis Family Impact questionnaire (1998) Br J Dermatol, 138, pp. 107-113; Atopic Eczema in Children: Management of Atopic Eczema in Children from Birth Up to the Age of 12 Years.

A total of 10 dogs with no history of skin disease were sampled at 10 distinct body sites consisting of haired and mucosal skin, and 8 dogs with diagnosed skin allergies were sampled at six body sites commonly affected by allergic disease. Analysis of similarities revealed that body site was not an influencing factor on membership or structure of fungal communities in healthy skin; however, the mucosal sites were significantly reduced in fungal richness. The mycobiota from body sites in healthy dogs tended to be similar within a dog, which was visualized in principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) by clustering of all sites from one dog separate from other dogs. The mycobiota of allergic skin was significantly less rich than that of healthy skin, and all sites sampled clustered by health status in PCoA. Interestingly, the most abundant fungi present on canine skin, across all body sites and health statuses, were Alternaria and Cladosporium--two of the most common fungal allergens in human environmental allergies. © FEMS 2015.","atopic dermatitis; dog; fungi; ITS; microbiome; skin","fungal DNA; animal; atopic dermatitis; classification; DNA sequence; dog; dog disease; dysbiosis; female; fungus; genetics; human; isolation and purification; male; microbiology; microflora; nucleotide sequence; procedures; skin; veterinary; Animals; Base Sequence; Dermatitis, Atopic; DNA, Fungal; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Dysbiosis; Female; Fungi; Humans; Male; Microbiota; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Skin",,"DNA, Fungal",,,"T35 OD010991

With the objective to modulate the intestinal microbiota, probiotic supplementation during infancy has been used for prevention of allergic diseases in infants, with variable success. However, not much is known about the longterm consequences of neonatal use of probiotics on the microbiota composition. The aim of this study was to assess the composition and microbial diversity in stool samples of infants at high-risk for atopic disease, from birth onwards to six years of age, who were treated with probiotics or placebo during the first year of life. Methods: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, a probiotic mixture consisting of B. bifidum W23, B. lactis W52 and Lc. Lactis W58 (Ecologic® Panda) was administered to pregnant women during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy and to their offspring during the first year of life. During follow-up, faecal samples were collected from 99 children over a 6-year period with the following time points: first week, second week, first month, three months, first year, eighteen months, two years and six years. Bacterial profiling was performed by IS-pro. Differences in bacterial abundance and diversity were assessed by conventional statistics. Results: The presence of the supplemented probiotic strains in faecal samples was confirmed, and the probiotic strains had a higher abundance and prevalence in the probiotic group during supplementation. Only minor and short term differences in composition of microbiota were found between the probiotic and placebo group and between children with or without atopy. The diversity of Bacteroidetes was significantly higher after two weeks in the placebo group, and at the age of two years atopic children had a significantly higher Proteobacteria diversity (p < 0.05). Gut microbiota development continued between two and six years, whereby microbiota composition at phylum level evolved more and more towards an adult-like configuration. Conclusion: Perinatal supplementation with Ecologic® Panda, to children at high-risk for atopic disease, had minor effects on gut microbiota composition during the supplementation period. No long lasting differences were identified. Regardless of intervention or atopic disease status, children had a shared microbiota development over time determined by age that continued to develop between two and six years. © 2015 Rutten et al.",,"ecologic; probiotic agent; unclassified drug; placebo; probiotic agent; RNA 16S; RNA 23S; Actinobacteria; Article; atopic dermatitis; atopy; Bacteroidetes; Bifidobacterium animalis; Bifidobacterium bifidum; child; colony forming unit; controlled study; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; discriminant analysis; double blind procedure; feces analysis; Firmicutes; fluorescence in situ hybridization; follow up; Fusobacteria; human; immune response; infant; intestine flora; Lactococcus lactis; major clinical study; newborn; population abundance; pregnant woman; preschool child; Proteobacteria; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; species diversity; Verrucomicrobia; bacterium identification; Bifidobacterium; biodiversity; dietary supplement; drug effects; female; genetics; hypersensitivity; immunology; intestine flora; Lactobacillus; male; metagenome; pregnancy; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Bifidobacterium; Biodiversity; Child; Child, Preschool; Dietary Supplements; Double-Blind Method; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Lactobacillus; Male; Metagenome; Placebos; Pregnancy; Probiotics; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; RNA, Ribosomal, 23S",,"Placebos; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; RNA, Ribosomal, 23S","ecologic panda, Winclove Probiotics, Netherlands","Winclove Probiotics, Netherlands",,,,,,"Makino, H., Kushiro, A., Ishikawa, E., Kubota, H., Gawad, A., Sakai, T., Mother-to-infant transmission of intestinal bifidobacterial strains has an impact on the early development of vaginally delivered infant's microbiota (2013) PLoS One., 8. , 24244304; Bisgaard, H., Li, N., Bonnelykke, K., Chawes, B.L.K., Skov, T., Paludan-Müller, G., Reduced diversity of the intestinal microbiota during infancy is associated with increased risk of allergic disease at school age (2011) J Allergy Clin Immunol., 128, pp. 646-652. , 21782228 e1-5; Li, M., Wang, M., Donovan, S.M., Early development of the gut microbiome and immune-mediated childhood disorders (2014) Semin Reprod Med., 32, pp. 74-86. , 24390924; Ringel-Kulka, T., Cheng, J., Ringel, Y., Salojärvi, J., Carroll, I., Palva, A., Intestinal microbiota in healthy U.S. Young children and adults - A high throughput microarray analysis (2013) PLoS One., 8. , 23717595; Nylund, L., Satokari, R., Nikkilä, J., Rajilić-Stojanović, M., Kalliomäki, M., Isolauri, E., Microarray analysis reveals marked intestinal microbiota aberrancy in infants having eczema compared to healthy children in at-risk for atopic disease (2013) BMC Microbiol., 13, p. 12. , 23339708; Fouhy, F., Ross, R.P., Fitzgerald, G., Stanton, C., Cotter, P.D., Food, E., (2012) Knowledge, Knowledge Gaps and the Use of High-throughput Sequencing to Address These Gaps © 2012 Landes Bioscience, pp. 203-220; Wang, M., Karlsson, C., Olsson, C., Adlerberth, I., Wold, A.E., Strachan, D.P., Reduced diversity in the early fecal microbiota of infants with atopic eczema (2008) J Allergy Clin Immunol., 121, pp. 129-134. , 18028995; Nylund, L., Nermes, M., Isolauri, E., Salminen, S., De Vos, W.M., Satokari, R., Severity of atopic disease inversely correlates with intestinal microbiota diversity and butyrate-producing bacteria (2014) Allergy., 70, pp. 241-244; Abrahamsson, T.R., Jakobsson, H.E., Andersson, A.F., Björkstén, B., Engstrand, L., Jenmalm, M.C., Low diversity of the gut microbiota in infants with atopic eczema (2012) J Allergy Clin Immunol., 129, pp. 434-440. , 22153774 440. e1-2; Kirjavainen, P.V., Arvola, T., Salminen, S.J., Isolauri, E., Aberrant composition of gut microbiota of allergic infants: A target of bifidobacterial therapy at weaning?

Direct comparisons between European American (EA) and Asian patients with AD are unavailable, but earlier blood studies detected increased IL-17+-producing cell counts in Asian patients with AD. Objective We sought to characterize the Asian AD skin phenotype and compare it with the EA AD skin phenotype. Methods We performed genomic profiling (real-time PCR) and immunohistochemistry on lesional and nonlesional biopsy specimens from 52 patients with AD (25 EAs and 27 Asians), 10 patients with psoriasis (all EAs), and 27 healthy subjects (12 EAs and 15 Asians). Results Although disease severity/SCORAD scores were similar between the AD groups (58.0 vs 56.7, P =.77), greater acanthosis, higher Ki67 counts, and frequent parakeratosis were characteristics of lesional epidermis from Asian patients with AD (P &lt;.05). Most (24/27) Asian patients had high IgE levels. A principal component analysis using real-time PCR data clustered the Asian AD phenotype between the EA AD and psoriasis phenotypes. TH2 skewing characterized both Asian and EA patients with AD but not patients with psoriasis. Significantly higher TH17 and TH22 (IL17A, IL19, and S100A12 in lesional and IL-22 in nonlesional skin; P &lt;.05) and lower TH1/interferon (CXCL9, CXCL10, MX1, and IFNG in nonlesional skin; P &lt;.05) gene induction typified AD skin in Asian patients. Conclusion The Asian AD phenotype presents (even in the presence of increased IgE levels) a blended phenotype between that of EA patients with AD and those with psoriasis, including increased hyperplasia, parakeratosis, higher TH17 activation, and a strong TH2 component. The relative pathogenic contributions of the TH17 and TH2 axes in creating the Asian AD phenotype need to be tested in future clinical trials with appropriate targeted therapeutics. © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","acanthosis; Asian; Atopic dermatitis; European American; parakeratosis; psoriasis; TH1; TH17; TH2; TH22","calgranulin C; CXCL9 chemokine; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; gamma interferon receptor 1; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 17; interleukin 19; interleukin 22; Ki 67 antigen; cytokine; immunoglobulin E; acanthosis; adult; aged; Article; Asian; atopic dermatitis; comparative study; controlled study; dendritic cell; disease activity; disease severity; epidermis; epidermis hyperplasia; European American; female; gene cluster; gene induction; genomics; human; human cell; immunoglobulin blood level; immunohistochemistry; immunophenotyping; major clinical study; male; parakeratosis; polarization; principal component analysis; priority journal; psoriasis; real time polymerase chain reaction; skin biopsy; skin defect; T lymphocyte activation; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; Th2 cell; Th22 cell; adolescent; Asian continental ancestry group; atopic dermatitis; blood; Caucasian; cell differentiation; disease course; ethnology; gene expression profiling; immunology; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; phenotype; psoriasis; skin; Th17 cell; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cell Differentiation; Cytokines; Dermatitis, Atopic; Disease Progression; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Principal Component Analysis; Psoriasis; Skin; Th17 Cells; Th2 Cells; Young Adult",,"gamma interferon inducible protein 10, 97741-20-3; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; interleukin 19, 204338-30-7; interleukin 22, 457106-70-6, 478219-35-1, 554460-75-2; Cytokines; Immunoglobulin E",,,"National Center for Research Resources, NCRR: UL1RR024143

However, this classic sequence is not always present and only a few studies have addressed children at risk of developing asthma. The objective of this study is to define early-onset AD phenotypes leading to asthma. Methods: We performed a cluster analysis with 9 variables of 214 infants with early-onset AD prospectively enrolled in the ORCA cohort and followed each year on the occurrence of asthma until the age of 6. Results: We identified 3 clusters - cluster 1 (n = 94) with low to no sensitization to food (27.7%) or aeroallergens (10.6%) and moderate AD severity (SCORAD 25.29 +/- 14.6) called ""AD with low sensitization"";-cluster 2 (n = 84) characterized by a higher AD severity (SCORAD 32.66+/-16.6) and frequent sensitization to food (98.9%) or aeroallergens (26.2%), most likely multiple (96.4% for food allergens), called ""AD with multiple sensitizations"" - cluster 3 (n = 36) with parental history, moderate AD severity (SCORAD 24.46+/-15.7), moderate rate of sensitization to food allergens (38.9%) (exclusively single) with no sensitization to aeroallergens, called ""AD with familial history of asthma"". Percentages of children suffering from asthma at the age of 6 were higher in clusters 2 and 3 (36.1% and 33.3% respectively versus 14.9% in cluster 1, p<0.01). Conclusion: Two phenotypes in infants with early-onset AD convey a higher risk of developing asthma during childhood: multiple sensitization and familial history of asthma. © 2015 Amat et al.

It has been shown in atopic dermatitis that continuous low-level use of topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors in previously affected skin can prevent new flares. We hypothesized that a twice-weekly application of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment might be effective for maintaining repigmentation in therapeutically repigmented lesions of vitiligo patients. After randomization, sixteen patients with 31 patches were assigned to the placebo group and 19 patients with 41 patches were assigned to the tacrolimus group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 48.4% of lesions showed depigmentation in the placebo group, whereas 26.8% did in the tacrolimus group (P=0.059). The intention-to-treat results did not remain significant after adjustment for within-patient clustering, odds ratio (OR) 2.55; 95% confidence interval (CI; 0.65-9.97); P=0.1765. The per-protocol analysis (n=56) showed that 40% of lesions had some depigmentation in the placebo group, whereas only 9.7% did in the tacrolimus group (P=0.0075). The per-protocol results remained significant after adjustment for within-patient clustering: OR 6.22; 95% CI (1.48-26.12); P=0.0299. Our study shows that twice-weekly application of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment is effective in preventing the depigmentation of vitiligo patches that have been previously successfully repigmented. © 2015 The Society for Investigative Dermatology.",,"placebo; tacrolimus; calcineurin inhibitor; dermatological agent; immunosuppressive agent; tacrolimus; adult; Article; burning sensation; cancer recurrence; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; erythema; female; follow up; human; injection site stinging; intention to treat analysis; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; skin defect; vitiligo; cluster analysis; drug effects; pigmentation; psychology; quality of life; recurrent disease; risk; skin; topical drug administration; treatment outcome; vitiligo; Administration, Topical; Adult; Calcineurin Inhibitors; Cluster Analysis; Dermatologic Agents; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Pigmentation; Quality of Life; Recurrence; Skin; Tacrolimus; Treatment Outcome; Vitiligo",,"tacrolimus, 104987-11-3; Calcineurin Inhibitors; Dermatologic Agents; Immunosuppressive Agents; Tacrolimus",,,"Astellas Pharma US","Astellas provided research grant for this study.",,,,"Ezzedine, K., Eleftheriadou, V., Whitton, M., Vitiligo Lancet, , in press; Felsten, L.M., Alikhan, A., Petronic-Rosic, V., Vitiligo: A comprehensive overview part II: Treatment options and approach to treatment (2011) J Am Acad Dermatol, 65, pp. 493-514; Lepe, V., Moncada, B., Castanedo-Cazares, J.P., A double-blind randomized trial of 0.1% tacrolimus vs 0.05% clobetasol for the treatment of childhood vitiligo (2003) Arch Dermatol, 139, pp. 581-585; Nicolaidou, E., Antoniou, C., Stratigos, A.J., Efficacy, predictors of response, and long-term follow-up in patients with vitiligo treated with narrowband UVB phototherapy (2007) J am Acad Dermatol, 56, pp. 274-278; Ostovari, N., Passeron, T., Zakaria, W., Treatment of vitiligo by 308-nm excimer laser: An evaluation of variables affecting treatment response (2004) Lasers Surg Med, 35, pp. 152-156; Parsad, D., Dogra, S., Kanwar, A.J., Quality of life in patients with vitiligo (2003) Health Qual Life Outcomes, 1, p. 58; Passeron, T., Ortonne, J.P., Activation of the unfolded protein response in vitiligo: The missing link?

However, most of these markers are not only psoriasis-specific but also found in other inflammatory disorders. We performed an unsupervised cluster analysis of gene expression profiles in 150 psoriasis patients and other inflammatory skin diseases (atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, contact eczema, and healthy controls). We identified a cluster of IL-17/tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-associated genes specifically expressed in psoriasis, among which IL-36γ was the most outstanding marker. In subsequent immunohistological analyses, IL-36γ was confirmed to be expressed in psoriasis lesions only. IL-36γ peripheral blood serum levels were found to be closely associated with disease activity, and they decreased after anti-TNFα-treatment. Furthermore, IL-36γ immunohistochemistry was found to be a helpful marker in the histological differential diagnosis between psoriasis and eczema in diagnostically challenging cases. These features highlight IL-36γ as a valuable biomarker in psoriasis patients, both for diagnostic purposes and measurement of disease activity during the clinical course. Furthermore, IL-36γ might also provide a future drug target, because of its potential amplifier role in TNFα- and IL-17 pathways in psoriatic skin inflammation. © 2015 The Society for Investigative Dermatology.",,"biological marker; CXCL9 chemokine; cytokine; etanercept; interleukin 17; interleukin 19; interleukin 36 gamma; macrophage inflammatory protein 3beta; platelet derived growth factor; protein S 100; suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; biological marker; IL36G protein, human; interleukin 1; interleukin 17; Article; atopic dermatitis; contact dermatitis; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; disease activity; disease course; down regulation; eczema; follow up; gene cluster; gene expression; gene expression profiling; genetic association; human; human tissue; immunohistology; lichen planus; major clinical study; mycosis fungoides; pityriasis lichenoides; predictive value; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; psoriasis; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; pustular psoriasis; skin biopsy; skin defect; skin lupus erythematosus; systemic therapy; tinea; treatment duration; upregulation; biopsy; gene expression regulation; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; metabolism; psoriasis; skin disease; Biological Markers; Biopsy; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Inflammation; Interleukin-1; Interleukin-17; Predictive Value of Tests; Psoriasis; Skin Diseases",,"etanercept, 185243-69-0, 200013-86-1; interleukin 19, 204338-30-7; macrophage inflammatory protein 3beta, 181030-14-8; thymus and activation regulated chemokine, 181532-29-6; Biological Markers; IL36G protein, human; Interleukin-1; Interleukin-17",,,"0306v12

Proactive maintenance treatment with moisturizing agents is the mainstay AD therapy. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a non-steroidal barrier cream (Atopiclair), compared to regular emollient in pediatric patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Methods: A Markov decision model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Atopiclair versus regular emollient in 12 Asia-Pacific countries, grouped by income categories based on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Data was obtained from structured literature review, expert opinion, fee schedules, and findings from a 2012 survey of 12 Asia-Pacific countries. Analysis was performed a societal perspective. Results: In the base case analysis, Atopiclair was cost-effective against regular emollient, with USD786, USD499, and USD289 in cost savings per year for high, middle, and low-income countries, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed that Atopiclair remained cost-effective versus regular emollient. Conclusions: Modelling analysis showed that Atopiclair is a cost-effective treatment compared to regular emollient for mild-to-moderate pediatric AD in the countries included in the study.

There is an increasing appreciation of heterogeneity within asthma and allergic diseases based primarily on recent cluster analyses, molecular phenotyping, biomarkers, and differential responses to targeted and nontargeted therapies. These pioneering studies have led to successful therapeutic trials of molecularly targeted therapies in defined phenotypes. This review analyzed randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of molecularly targeted therapies in defined allergic disease and asthma phenotypes. IgE was the first successful biological target used in patients with allergic disease and asthma. This review shows that therapies targeting the canonical type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 have shown consistent efficacy, especially in asthmatic patients with evidence of TH2/type 2 inflammation (""type 2 high""). As of yet, there are no successful trials of targeted therapies in asthmatic patients without evidence for type 2 inflammation. We conclude that further refinement of type 2 therapies to specific type 2 phenotypes and novel approaches for patients without type 2 inflammation are needed for asthma and allergic disease treatment. © 2014 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","Asthma phenotypes; biologic therapies; eosinophils; IgE; IL-13; IL-4; IL-5; TH2/type 2 inflammation","allergen; biological marker; biological product; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 13; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; tumor necrosis factor alpha; antiasthmatic agent; biological factor; biological marker; cytokine; immunoglobulin E; allergic asthma; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; biological therapy; disease severity; drug efficacy; eosinophil; eosinophilia; food allergy; human; inflammation; intervention study; molecularly targeted therapy; neutrophil; nonhuman; personalized medicine; pharmacogenetics; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phenotype; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Th2 cell; treatment response; urticaria; antagonists and inhibitors; asthma; drug effects; genetics; hypersensitivity; immunology; metabolism; signal transduction; Anti-Asthmatic Agents; Asthma; Biological Factors; Biological Markers; Cytokines; Eosinophils; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunoglobulin E; Individualized Medicine; Neutrophils; Pharmacogenetics; Phenotype; Signal Transduction; Th2 Cells",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; Anti-Asthmatic Agents; Biological Factors; Biological Markers; Cytokines; Immunoglobulin E",,,,,,,,"(2007) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma: Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR3), , http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/asthgdln.pdf, National Asthma Education and Prevention Program National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Bethesda (MD) Publication no. 08-4051.

Study design A Markov model was developed integrating published data, a survey of US pediatricians, costing sources and market data, and expert opinion. Key modeled outcomes included reduction in AD risk, time spent post AD diagnosis, days without AD flare, and AD-related costs. Costs and clinical consequences were discounted at 3% annually. Results An estimated absolute 14-percentage point reduction in AD risk was calculated with the use of PHF-W compared with CMF (95% CI for difference, 3%-22%). Relative to CMF, PHF-W decreased the time spent post-AD diagnosis by 8.3 months (95% CI, 2.78-13.31) per child and increased days without AD flare by 39 days (95% CI, 13-63) per child. The AD-related, 6-year total cost estimate was $495 less (95% CI, -$813 to -$157) per child with PHF-W ($724 per child; 95% CI, $385-$1269) compared with CMF ($1219 per child; 95% CI, $741-$1824). Conclusion Utilization of PHF-W in place of CMF as the initial infant formula administered to high-risk US infants not exclusively breastfed during the first 4 months of life may reduce the incidence and economic burden of AD. Broad implementation of this strategy could result in a minimum savings of $355 million per year to society. © 2015 The Authors.",,"antibiotic agent; antihistaminic agent; antiinflammatory agent; corticosteroid; emollient agent; immunosuppressive agent; non prescription drug; milk protein; whey protein; Article; artificial milk; atopic dermatitis; bottle feeding; corticosteroid therapy; cost effectiveness analysis; disease course; disease exacerbation; disease severity; drug cost; drug potency; follow up; health care cost; high risk infant; human; infant; milk; newborn; nutritional requirement; onset age; outcome assessment; partially hydrolyzed whey formula; priority journal; risk assessment; risk reduction; topical treatment; whey; adverse effects; animal; atopic dermatitis; chemically induced; chemistry; child; cohort analysis; cost benefit analysis; cost of illness; economics; milk; Milk Hypersensitivity; preschool child; probability; risk factor; theoretical model; treatment outcome; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Cost of Illness; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Infant; Infant Formula; Infant, Newborn; Markov Chains; Milk; Milk Hypersensitivity; Milk Proteins; Models, Theoretical; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome",,"Milk Proteins; whey protein",,,,,,,,"Horii, K.A., Simon, S.D., Liu, D.Y., Sharma, V., Atopic dermatitis in children in the United States, 1997-2004: Visit trends, patient and provider characteristics, and prescribing patterns (2007) Pediatrics, 120, pp. e527-e534; Shaw, T.E., Currie, G.P., Koudelka, C.W., Simpson, E.L., Eczema prevalence in the United States: Data from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health (2011) J Invest Dermatol, 131, pp. 67-73; Laughter, D., Istvan, J.A., Tofte, S.J., Hanifin, J.M., The prevalence of atopic dermatitis in Oregon schoolchildren (2000) J Am Acad Dermatol, 43, pp. 649-655; Kapoor, R., Menon, C., Hoffstad, O., Bilker, W., Leclerc, P., Margolis, D.J., The prevalence of atopic triad in children with physician-confirmed atopic dermatitis (2008) J Am Acad Dermatol, 58, pp. 68-73; Fivenson, D., Arnold, R.J., Kaniecki, D.J., Cohen, J.L., Frech, F., Finlay, A.Y., The effect of atopic dermatitis on total burden of illness and quality of life on adults and children in a large managed care organization (2002) J Manag Care Pharm, 8, pp. 333-342; Chamlin, S.L., Frieden, I.J., Williams, M.L., Chren, M.M., Effects of atopic dermatitis on young American children and their families (2004) Pediatrics, 114, pp. 607-611; Ellis, C.N., Drake, L.A., Prendergast, M.M., Abramovits, W., Boguniewicz, M., Daniel, C.R., Cost of atopic dermatitis and eczema in the United States (2002) J Am Acad Dermatol, 46, pp. 361-370; Von Berg, A., Filipiak-Pittroff, B., Kramer, U., Hoffmann, B., Link, E., Beckmann, C., Allergies in high-risk schoolchildren after early intervention with cow's milk protein hydrolysates: 10-year results from the German Infant Nutritional Intervention (GINI) study (2013) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 131, pp. 1565-1573; Alexander, D.D., Cabana, M.D., Partially hydrolyzed 100% whey protein infant formula and reduced risk of atopic dermatitis: A meta-analysis (2010) J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr, 50, pp. 422-430; Szajewska, H., Horvath, A., Meta-analysis of the evidence for a partially hydrolyzed 100% whey formula for the prevention of allergic diseases (2010) Curr Med Res Opin, 26, pp. 423-437; Marini, A., Agosti, M., Motta, G., Mosca, F., Effects of a dietary and environmental prevention programme on the incidence of allergic symptoms in high atopic risk infants: Three years' follow-up (1996) Acta Paediatr Suppl, 414, pp. 1-21; Vandenplas, Y., Hauser, B., Van Den Borre, C., Clybouw, C., Mahler, T., Hachimi-Idrissi, S., The long-term effect of a partial whey hydrolysate formula on the prophylaxis of atopic disease (1995) Eur J Pediatr, 154, pp. 488-494; Boyce, J.A., Assa'Ad, A., Burks, A.W., Jones, S.M., Sampson, H.A., Wood, R.A., Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy in the United States: Report of the NIAID-sponsored expert panel (2010) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 126, pp. S1-S58; Fleischer, D.M., Spergel, J.M., Assa'Ad, A.H., Pongracic, J.A., Primary prevention of allergic disease through nutritional interventions (2013) J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract, 1, pp. 29-36; Host, A., Halken, S., Muraro, A., Dreborg, S., Niggemann, B., Aalberse, R., Dietary prevention of allergic diseases in infants and small children (2008) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 19, pp. 1-4; Mertens, J., Stock, S., Lungen, M., Von Berg, A., Kramer, U., Filipiak-Pittroff, B., Is prevention of atopic eczema with hydrolyzed formulas cost-effective?

Here, we analyzed publicly available microarray data from 16 diverse skin conditions in order to gain insight into disease pathogenesis. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated samples by disease as well as common cellular and molecular pathways. Disease-specific signatures were leveraged to build a multi-disease classifier, which predicted the diagnosis of publicly and prospectively collected expression profiles with 93% accuracy. In one sample, the molecular classifier differed from the initial clinical diagnosis and correctly predicted the eventual diagnosis as the clinical presentation evolved. Finally, integration of IFN-regulated gene programs with the skin database revealed a significant inverse correlation between IFN-β and IFN-γ programs across all conditions. Our study provides an integrative approach to the study of gene signatures from multiple skin conditions, elucidating mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. In addition, these studies provide a framework for developing tools for personalized medicine toward the precise prediction, prevention, and treatment of disease on an individual level. © 2015 The Society for Investigative Dermatology.",,"beta interferon; gamma interferon; beta interferon; gamma interferon; transcriptome; Article; atopic dermatitis; basal cell carcinoma; burn; clinical feature; comparative study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; gene control; gene expression profiling; human; human tissue; immunopathogenesis; irritant dermatitis; leprosy; microarray analysis; mycosis fungoides; priority journal; psoriasis; sarcoidosis; sensitivity and specificity; skin allergy; skin carcinoma; skin disease; skin injury; Stevens Johnson syndrome; surgical wound; ulcus molle; biological model; cluster analysis; genetics; immunology; predictive value; Skin Diseases; Cluster Analysis; Humans; Interferon-beta; Interferon-gamma; Microarray Analysis; Models, Genetic; Predictive Value of Tests; Skin Diseases; Transcriptome",,"gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; Interferon-beta; Interferon-gamma",,,"P50 5P50AR063020

Spectra of normal or pathological skin were collected from 15 patients. Principal component analysis and principal component scores of skin spectra were employed to distinguish the spectral characteristics with different diseases. Finally, skin regions with suspected cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) lesions were successfully predicted by evaluation and classification of the spectra of pathological skin. The sensitivity and specificity of this technique were 89.65% and 95.18% after the analysis of about 109 patients.

In patients affected by both psoriasis and nonatopic or atopic eczema simultaneously (n = 24), an intraindividual comparison of the molecular signatures of psoriasis and eczema identified genes and signaling pathways regulated in common and exclusive for each disease across all patients. Psoriasis-specific genes were important regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism, epidermal differentiation, as well as immune mediators of T helper 17 (TH17) responses, interleukin-10 (IL-10) family cytokines, and IL-36. Genes in eczema related to epidermal barrier, reduced innate immunity, increased IL-6, and a TH2 signature. Within eczema subtypes, a mutually exclusive regulation of epidermal differentiation genes was observed. Furthermore, only contact eczema was driven by inflammasome activation, apoptosis, and cellular adhesion. On the basis of this comprehensive picture of the pathogenesis of psoriasis and eczema, a disease classifier consisting of NOS2 and CCL27 was created. In an independent cohort of eczema (n = 28) and psoriasis patients (n = 25), respectively, this classifier diagnosed all patients correctly and also identified initially misdiagnosed or clinically undifferentiated patients.",,"cutaneous T cell attracting chemokine; cytokine; guanine deaminase; haptocorrin; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 10; interleukin 13; interleukin 36; interleukin 6; sclerostin; unclassified drug; adult; article; atopic dermatitis; C type lectin family member 4 gene; chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 27 gene; classifier; clinical article; comorbidity; contact dermatitis; controlled study; differentiation; down regulation; eczema; epidermis; female; gene; gene expression; gene ontology; glucose metabolism; guanine deaminase gene; human; human tissue; inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 gene; interleukin 13 gene; interleukin 36A gene; interleukin 36G gene; kallikrein related peptidase 13 gene; lipid metabolism; male; neuronal pentraxin 1 gene; pathogenesis; phospholipase A2 group IVG gene; principal component analysis; priority journal; psoriasis; psoriasis vulgaris; RH family C glycoprotein gene; sclerostin gene; serine transmembrane protease 11D gene; signal transduction; Th17 cell; Th2 cell; transcobalamin 1 gene; transglutaminase 1 gene; upregulation; cohort analysis; eczema; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; human genome; middle aged; pathology; psoriasis; Adult; Cohort Studies; Eczema; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genome, Human; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Principal Component Analysis; Psoriasis; Signal Transduction",,"guanine deaminase, 9033-16-3; haptocorrin, 12651-27-3; inducible nitric oxide synthase, 501433-35-8; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0",,,"259294",,,,,"Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis (2008) N.

In this study, 19 children's day care centers (DCC) from 2 main Portuguese cities were selected after stratification and cluster analysis. An ISAAC's (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) derived health questionnaire was applied to a sample of children attending DCCs. Outcomes were FA parental report and anaphylaxis. Logistic regression was used to explore potential risk factors for reported FA. From the 2228 distributed questionnaires, 1217 were included in the analysis (54.6%). Children's median age was 3.5 years, and 10.8% were described as ever having had FA. Current FA was reported in 5.7%. Three (0.2%) reports compatible with anaphylaxis were identified. Reported parental history of FA, personal history of atopic dermatitis, and preterm birth increased the odds for reported current FA. A high prevalence of parental-perceived FA in preschool-age children was identified. Risk factor identification may enhance better prevention. © The Author(s) 2014.","anaphylactic reaction; children; food allergy; prevalence; risk factors","anaphylaxis; article; atopic dermatitis; child; clinical article; cluster analysis; cross-sectional study; day care; demography; female; food allergy; human; infant; logistic regression analysis; male; outcome assessment; Portugal; premature labor; preschool child; prevalence; questionnaire; risk factor; anaphylaxis; clinical trial; Food Hypersensitivity; multicenter study; Anaphylaxis; Child; Child Day Care Centers; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Infant; Male; Portugal; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,"Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia para Excitotoxicidade e Neuroproteção, INCT-EN: PEst-OE/MAT/UI0006/2011, PTDC/SAU-ESA/100275/2008","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia—ENVIRH Project PTDC/SAU-ESA/100275/2008 and PEst-OE/MAT/UI0006/2011.",,,,"Chafen, J.J., Newberry, S.J., Ma, R., Diagnosing and managing common food allergies: A systematic review (2010) JAMA, 303, pp. 1848-1856; Sackeyfio, A., Senthinathan, A., Kandaswamy, P., Barry, P.W., Shaw, B., Baker, M., Diagnosis and assessment of food allergy in children and young people: Summary of NICE guidance (2011) BMJ, 342, p. 747; Fiocchi, A., Schunemann, H.J., Brozek, J., Diagnosis and Rationale for Action Against Cow's Milk Allergy (DRACMA): A summary report (2010) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 126, pp. 1119-1128; Urisu, A., Ebisawa, M., Mukoyama, T., Morikawa, A., Kondo, N., Japanese guideline for food allergy (2011) Allergol Int, 60, pp. 221-236; Burks, A.W., Tang, M., Sicherer, S., ICON: Food allergy (2012) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 129, pp. 906-920; Sampson, H.A., Munoz-Furlong, A., Bock, S.A., Symposium on the definition and management of anaphylaxis: Summary report (2005) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 115, pp. 584-591; Novembre, E., Cianferoni, A., Bernardini, R., Anaphylaxis in children: Clinical and allergologic features (1998) Pediatrics, 101, p. 8; Bock, S.A., Munoz-Furlong, A., Sampson, H.A., Fatalities due to anaphylactic reactions to foods (2001) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 107, pp. 191-193; Mehl, A., Wahn, U., Niggemann, B., Anaphylactic reactions in children: A questionnaire-based survey in Germany (2005) Allergy, 60, pp. 1440-1445; Muraro, A., Roberts, G., Clark, A., The management of anaphylaxis in childhood: Position paper of the European academy of allergology and clinical immunology (2007) Allergy, 62, pp. 857-871; Caffarelli, C., Coscia, A., Ridolo, E., Parents' estimate of food allergy prevalence and management in Italian school-aged children (2011) Pediatr Int, 53, pp. 505-510; Decker, W.W., Campbell, R.L., Manivannan, V., The etiology and incidence of anaphylaxis in Rochester, Minnesota: A report from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (2008) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 122, pp. 1161-1165; Braganza, S.C., Acworth, J.P., McKinnon, D.R., Peake, J.E., Brown, A.F., Paediatric emergency department anaphylaxis: Different patterns from adults (2006) Arch Dis Child, 91, pp. 159-163; Moneret-Vautrin, D.A., Romano, M.C., Kanny, G., The individual reception project (IRP) for anaphylactic emergencies.

For many identified genes, however, the cell type mediating disease activity is uncertain, which has limited our ability to design gene functional studies based on genomic findings. Methods. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with altered expression in psoriasis lesions (n = 216 patients), as well as candidate genes near susceptibility loci from psoriasis GWAS studies. These gene sets were characterized based upon their expression across 10 cell types present in psoriasis lesions. Susceptibility-associated variation at intergenic (non-coding) loci was evaluated to identify sites of allele-specific transcription factor binding. Results: Half of DEGs showed highest expression in skin cells, although the dominant cell type differed between psoriasis-increased DEGs (keratinocytes, 35%) and psoriasis-decreased DEGs (fibroblasts, 33%). In contrast, psoriasis GWAS candidates tended to have highest expression in immune cells (71%), with a significant fraction showing maximal expression in neutrophils (24%, P < 0.001). By identifying candidate cell types for genes near susceptibility loci, we could identify and prioritize SNPs at which susceptibility variants are predicted to influence transcription factor binding. This led to the identification of potentially causal (non-coding) SNPs for which susceptibility variants influence binding of AP-1, NF-κB, IRF1, STAT3 and STAT4. Conclusions: These findings underscore the role of innate immunity in psoriasis and highlight neutrophils as a cell type linked with pathogenetic mechanisms. Assignment of candidate cell types to genes emerging from GWAS studies provides a first step towards functional analysis, and we have proposed an approach for generating hypotheses to explain GWAS hits at intergenic loci. © 2014 Swindell et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","AP-1; Fibroblast; GWAS; Keratinocyte; Microarray; Neutrophil; TNFRSF9; Transcription factor","immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interferon regulatory factor 1; STAT3 protein; STAT4 protein; transcription factor AP 1; tumor necrosis factor receptor; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9; unclassified drug; article; atopic dermatitis; binding site; boutonneuse fever; controlled study; gene expression; gene locus; genetic association; genetic susceptibility; human; human cell; innate immunity; keratinocyte; macrophage; major clinical study; neutrophil; priority journal; psoriasis; single nucleotide polymorphism; skin fibroblast; squamous cell carcinoma; transcriptomics; Antigens, CD137; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Cluster Analysis; Cytokines; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Keratinocytes; Macrophages; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Molecular Sequence Data; Neutrophils; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Psoriasis; RNA, Messenger; Transcription Factors",,"tumor necrosis factor receptor, 129203-93-6, 184595-01-5",,,"AR042742, AR050511, AR054966, AR060802, AR062382, AR065183

The Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis is the only questionnaire developed specifically for assessment of psychosomatization in atopic dermatitis. Objectives: the objective of this study was to cross-culturally adapt and validate a Brazilian-Portuguese version of the Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis. Methods: adaptation consisted of independent translation and backtranslation by three bilingual translators, followed by a pre-test. The Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis and the Dermatology Life Quality Index were self-administered to 47 patients with atopic dermatitis. Disease severity was evaluated using the Eczema Area and Severity Index. Factor analysis was used to identify the dimensions of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis. Internal consistency and convergence validity were also analyzed. Reproducibility was assessed using the Kappa coefficient. Results: factor analysis revealed a two-dimensional structure: stress/laziness/insecurity (I) and maladjustment/social relationships (II), explaining 54.4% of total variance. All dimensions revealed excellent internal consistency. External construct validity was confirmed by positive correlations between the Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis and the Dermatology Life Quality Index. Test-retest reliability was excellent, with k>0.7 for all questions. Conclusions: the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties and can be used for the evaluation of psychosomatic symptoms in patients with atopic dermatitis and as a tool in clinical and epidemiological research. © 2014 by Anais Brasileiros de Dermatologia.","Atopic; Cost of illness; Dermatitis; Physiological; Psychological; Questionnaires; Stress; Validation studies","adult; atopic dermatitis; Brazil; cultural factor; female; human; male; mental stress; middle aged; procedures; psychology; psychometry; Psychophysiologic Disorders; publication; quality of life; questionnaire; reference value; reproducibility; standards; validation study; young adult; Adult; Brazil; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Psychophysiologic Disorders; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; Stress, Psychological; Translations; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,"Eichenfield, L.F., Hanifin, J.M., Luger, T.A., Stevens, S.R., Pride, H.B., Consensus conference on pediatric atopic dermatitis (2003) J Am Acad Dermatol, 49, pp. 1088-1095; Abramovits, W., Atopic dermatitis (2005) J Am Acad Dermatol, 53, pp. S86-S93; Ring, J., Alomar, A., Bieber, T., Deleuran, M., Fink-Wagner, A., Gelmetti, C., Guidelines for treatment of atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) part I (2012) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 26, pp. 1045-1060; Katsarou, A., Armenaka, M., Atopic dermatitis in older patients: Particular points (2011) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 25, pp. 12-18; Illi, S., Von Mutius, E., Lau, S., Nickel, R., Grüber, C., Niggemann, B., The natural course of atopic dermatitis from birth to age 7 years and the association with asthma (2004) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 113, pp. 925-931; Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis (2008) N Engl J Med, 358, pp. 1483-1494; Arndt, J., Smith, N., Tausk, F., Stress and atopic dermatitis (2008) Curr Allergy Asthma Rep, 8, pp. 312-317; Harth, W., Psychosomatic dermatology (psychodermatology) (2008) J Dtsch Dermatol Ges, 6, pp. 67-76; Lammintausta, K., Kalimo, K., Raitala, R., Forsten, Y., Prognosis of atopic dermatitis.

However, the corresponding IgE-recognition patterns have not yet been extensively characterized using multiallergen microarrays. Objective To provide comprehensive, molecular IgE repertoires in paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis using microarray technology. Methods Sera of 140 affected children were screened with a protein microarray containing a panel of 95 inhalant, food and staphylococcal antigen components. In addition, total serum IgE levels and further clinical parameters were recorded. Results At a mean total IgE level of 1528 kU/L, the number of sensitizations varied from 0 to 32 per patient, and regression analysis revealed a significant association between total IgE and the quantity of recognized antigens. A total of 78 single allergen and microbial components elicited at least one IgE response, while 11 plant and 13 non-plant molecules were recognized by more than 10% of patients. Specific IgE against Staphylococcus aureus could be detected in 14% of children. Sensitization rates against the studied allergen molecules differed significantly when stratified by age. Whereas reactivity against inhalant allergens and SEC was lowest in the youngest group (<24 months) reaching highest values in children ≥72 months, IgE responses against food allergen components peaked in younger age groups (0-48 months) and clearly declined in patients of higher age. The large amount of microarray data could be aggregated by centroid cluster analysis revealing valid allergen clusters possibly linked with higher disease severity as determined by multivariate analysis of covariance. Conclusion Allergenic molecule microarray analysis can be regarded as a suitable research tool for large-scale IgE screening in infants and children with atopic dermatitis (AD). Still, further studies in well-defined populations are needed to exactly identify its tangible benefits in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of affected patients in daily clinical practice. © 2013 The Authors Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology © 2013 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.",,"allergen;

Recent studies have begun to suggest that atopy, as conventionally defined, might be an umbrella term that obfuscates more specific allergic disease types. Objective We sought to determine whether distinct and meaningful atopic phenotypes exist within a racially diverse birth cohort using 10 allergen-specific serum IgE (sIgE) measurements from children aged 2 years. Methods Using the Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study (WHEALS) birth cohort (62% black), we analyzed sIgE data on 10 allergens (Dermatophagoides farinae, dog, cat, timothy grass, ragweed, Alternaria alternata, egg, peanut, milk, and German cockroach) obtained from 594 children at age 2 years. Conventional atopy was defined as at least 1 sIgE level of 0.35 IU/mL or greater. Results A 4-class solution (latent class model) was the best fit. Class types were labeled ""low to no sensitization"" (76.9% of sample), ""highly sensitized"" (2.7%), ""milk and egg dominated"" (15.3%), and ""peanut and inhalant(s)"" (5.1%). Almost one third (32.2%) of the low to no sensitization group met the criteria for conventional atopy. The highly sensitized group was significantly associated with a doctor's diagnosis of asthma after age 4 years (odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% CI, 1.6-17.4), whereas the milk and egg dominated and peanut and inhalant(s) groups were not (ORs of 1.6 [95% CI, 0.8-3.0] and 1.8 [95% CI, 0.6-4.9], respectively). Children of black race were more likely to be in the 3 multisensitized groups (P =.04). Conclusion Classification by sIgE patterns defined groups whose membership is more strongly associated with atopic dermatitis, wheeze, and asthma compared with conventional atopy. © 2014 The Authors.

To empirically identify underlying subtypes of NSV, we performed latent class analysis (LCA) of 717 consecutive patients with NSV seen between 2006 and 2012 and were analyzed. Median age was 32 yrs (14-45), median age at NSV onset was 18 yrs (8-32), and median NSV duration 5 yrs (0.75-78.5). A two-class model showed the best fit. Of the 717 patients, 280 (39%) belonged to LC1 and 437 (61%) to LC2. LC1 patients had high probabilities for early disease onset (<12 yrs), halo nevi, family history of premature hair greying, Koebner phenomenon, previous episodes of repigmentation, and family history of vitiligo. By contrast, LC2 patients were characterized by a late disease onset (after or at the age of 12 yrs, median age of 30 yrs) and acrofacial localization without any lesions on trunk or limbs. These two LCA classes (LC1, 'prepubertal onset'; LC2, 'post-pubertal onset') may help refining results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and allow a more accurate genotype-phenotype correlation and help defining more directed treatment protocols. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Endophenotype; Latent class analysis; Post-pubertal; Prepubertal; Vitiligo","adolescent; adult; article; atopic dermatitis; cross-sectional study; disease classification; disease duration; family history; female; genetic association; genotype; genotype phenotype correlation; halo nevus; human; isomorphic phenomenon; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non segmental vitiligo; onset age; premature hair greying; prepuberty; skin disease; skin pigmentation; vitiligo; young adult; endophenotype; latent class analysis; post-pubertal; prepubertal; vitiligo; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Vitiligo",,,,,,,,,,"Benzekri, L., Gauthier, Y., Hamada, S., Clinical features and histological findings are potential indicators of activity in lesions of common vitiligo (2013) Br.

Genetic predisposition, immunologic hyperreactivity, a defective skin barrier, and environmental factors play a role in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to analyze gene expression in the skin of dogs sensitized to house dust mite antigens. Skin biopsy samples were collected from six sensitized and six nonsensitized Beagle dogs before and 6 hr and 24 hr after challenge using skin patches with allergen or saline as a negative control. Transcriptome analysis was performed by the use of DNA microarrays and expression of selected genes was validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Expression data were compared between groups (unpaired design). After 24 hr, 597 differentially expressed genes were detected, 361 with higher and 226 with lower mRNA concentrations in allergen-treated skin of sensitized dogs compared with their saline-treated skin and compared with the control specimens. Functional annotation clustering and pathway- and co-citation analysis showed that the genes with increased expression were involved in inflammation, wound healing, and immune response. In contrast, genes with decreased expression in sensitized dogs were associated with differentiation and barrier function of the skin. Because the sensitized dogs did not show differences in the untreated skin compared with controls, inflammation after allergen patch test probably led to a decrease in the expression of genes important for barrier formation. Our results further confirm the similar pathophysiology of human and canine atopic dermatitis and revealed genes previously not known to be involved in canine atopic dermatitis. © 2014 Schamber et al.","Allergy; Beagle; Canine; Canis familiaris; Microarray","antigen; messenger RNA; transcriptome; allergen; house dust allergen; messenger RNA; animal tissue; Article; atopic dermatitis; beagle; controlled study; Dermatophagoides farinae; DNA microarray; environmental factor; female; gene expression; genetic predisposition; immune response; immunostimulation; inflammation; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; patch test; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; skin biopsy; wound healing; animal; atopic dermatitis; biology; Dermatophagoides farinae; dog; down regulation; drug effects; metabolism; pathology; skin; time; upregulation; Canis familiaris; Dermatophagoides farinae; Pyroglyphidae; Allergens; Animals; Antigens, Dermatophagoides; Computational Biology; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dermatophagoides farinae; Dogs; Down-Regulation; Female; Male; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Skin; Time Factors; Up-Regulation","GENBANK: BI421087, CO597689, XM542531, XM843165","Allergens; Antigens, Dermatophagoides; RNA, Messenger",,,,,,,,"Ando-Akatsuka, Y., Saitou, M., Hirase, T., Kishi, M., Sakakibara, A., Interspecies diversity of the occludin sequence: cDNA cloning of human, mouse, dog, and rat-kangaroo homologues (1996) J.

Objective To further characterize the distinguishing features of phenotypic groups in difficult-to-treat asthma. Methods Children ages 6-11 years (n = 518) and adolescents and adults ages ≥12 years (n = 3612) with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma from The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens (TENOR) study were evaluated in this post hoc cluster analysis. Analyzed variables included sex, race, atopy, age of asthma onset, smoking (adolescents and adults), passive smoke exposure (children), obesity, and aspirin sensitivity. Cluster analysis used the hierarchical clustering algorithm with the Ward minimum variance method. The results were compared among clusters by χ2 analysis; variables with significant (P &lt;.05) differences among clusters were considered as distinguishing feature candidates. Associations among clusters and asthma-related health outcomes were assessed in multivariable analyses by adjusting for socioeconomic status, environmental exposures, and intensity of therapy. Results Five clusters were identified in each age stratum. Sex, atopic status, and nonwhite race were distinguishing variables in both strata; passive smoke exposure was distinguishing in children and aspirin sensitivity in adolescents and adults. Clusters were not related to outcomes in children, but 2 adult and adolescent clusters distinguished by nonwhite race and aspirin sensitivity manifested poorer quality of life (P &lt;.0001), and the aspirin-sensitive cluster experienced more frequent asthma exacerbations (P &lt;.0001). Conclusion Distinct phenotypes appear to exist in patients with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma, which is related to outcomes in adolescents and adults but not in children. The study of the therapeutic implications of these phenotypes is warranted. © 2014 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology.","atopy; cluster analysis; demographics; difficult-to-treat asthma; phenotype; severe asthma; TENOR","acetylsalicylic acid; acetylsalicylic acid; corticosteroid; immunoglobulin E; prednisone; adolescent; article; asthma; atopy; child; cluster analysis; disease exacerbation; drug hypersensitivity; female; human; major clinical study; male; passive smoking; phenotype; post hoc analysis; preschool child; priority journal; quality of life; race difference; school child; adult; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; difficult to treat asthma; difficult to treat asthma; disease exacerbation; drug megadose; drug sensitivity; environmental exposure; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; immunoglobulin blood level; obesity; onset age; pathogenesis; phenotype; prospective study; race; severe asthma; severe asthma; sex; smoking; social status; atopy; cluster analysis; demographics; difficult-to-treat asthma; phenotype; severe asthma; TENOR; Adolescent; Age Factors; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Phenotype; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult",,"acetylsalicylic acid, 493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; prednisone, 53-03-2","aspirin",,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI

Evolving disease models link changes in epidermal growth and differentiation to TH2/TH22 cytokine activation. However, these models have not been tested by in vivo suppression of T-cell cytokines. Cyclosporine (CsA) is an immunosuppressant that is highly effective for severe disease, but its mechanism in AD skin lesions has not been studied. Objective We sought to establish the ability of a systemic immunosuppressant to modulate immune and epidermal alterations that form the pathogenic disease phenotype and to correlate changes with clinical improvement. Methods CsA's effects on AD skin pathology were evaluated by using gene expression and immunohistochemistry studies in baseline, week 2, and week 12 lesional and nonlesional biopsy specimens from 19 patients treated with 5 mg/kg/d CsA for 12 weeks. Results After 2 and 12 weeks of treatment, we observed significant reductions of 51% and 72%, respectively, in SCORAD scores. Clinical improvements were associated with significant gene expression changes in lesional but also nonlesional skin, particularly reductions in levels of TH2-, TH22-, and some TH17-related molecules (ie, IL-13, IL-22, CCL17, S100As, and elafin/peptidase inhibitor 3), and modulation of epidermal hyperplasia and differentiation measures. Conclusions This is the first study that establishes a relationship between cytokine activation and molecular epidermal alterations, as well as correlations between disease biomarkers in the skin and clinical improvement. The reversal of the molecular phenotype with CsA and the associated biomarkers can serve as a reference for the successful modulation of tissue inflammation with specific immune antagonists in future studies, contributing to the understanding of the specific cytokines involved in epidermal pathology. © 2014 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology.","Atopic dermatitis; cyclosporine; epidermal abnormalities; immune; S100 proteins; T cell","biological marker; cyclosporin A; immunosuppressive agent; interleukin 13; interleukin 22; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; adult; aged; article; atopic dermatitis; cell differentiation; clinical article; correlation analysis; drug efficacy; epidermis hyperplasia; female; gene expression; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunosuppressive treatment; inflammation; male; pathogenesis; phenotype; priority journal; scoring system; skin defect; T lymphocyte; Th2 cell; treatment outcome; Atopic dermatitis; cyclosporine; epidermal abnormalities; immune; S100 proteins; T cell; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Biological Markers; Cluster Analysis; Cyclosporine; Dendritic Cells; Dermatitis, Atopic; Epidermis; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Hyperplasia; Immunosuppressive Agents; Inflammation; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Signal Transduction; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",,"cyclosporin A, 59865-13-3, 63798-73-2; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; interleukin 22, 457106-70-6, 478219-35-1, 554460-75-2; thymus and activation regulated chemokine, 181532-29-6",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

Objective Our aim was to examine the clinical relevance and temporal stability of phenotypic clusters in children with asthma. Methods We applied spectral clustering to clinical data from 1041 children with asthma participating in the Childhood Asthma Management Program. Posttreatment randomization follow-up data collected over 48 months were used to determine the effect of these clusters on pulmonary function and treatment response to inhaled anti-inflammatory medication. Results We found 5 reproducible patient clusters that could be differentiated on the basis of 3 groups of features: atopic burden, degree of airway obstruction, and history of exacerbation. Cluster grouping predicted long-term asthma control, as measured by the need for oral prednisone (P <.0001) or additional controller medications (P =.001), as well as longitudinal differences in pulmonary function (P <.0001). We also found that the 2 clusters with the highest rates of exacerbation had different responses to inhaled corticosteroids when compared with the other clusters. One cluster demonstrated a positive response to both budesonide (P =.02) and nedocromil (P =.01) compared with placebo, whereas the other cluster demonstrated minimal responses to both budesonide (P =.12) and nedocromil (P =.56) compared with placebo. Conclusion Phenotypic clustering can be used to identify longitudinally consistent and clinically relevant patient subgroups, with implications for targeted therapeutic strategies and clinical trials design.","asthma classification; asthma phenotypes; Childhood asthma; cluster analysis; inhaled corticosteroids; longitudinal study","beclometasone dipropionate; bronchodilating agent; budesonide; corticosteroid; methacholine; nedocromil; placebo; prednisone; salbutamol; antiinflammatory agent; beclometasone dipropionate; budesonide; nedocromil; prednisone; airway obstruction; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child; cluster analysis; controlled study; disease classification; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug response; female; follow up; human; lung function; major clinical study; male; medical history; outcome assessment; phenotype; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; respiratory tract allergy; treatment response; Article; atopy; disease control; phenotype; treatment response; Administration, Inhalation; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Asthma; Budesonide; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Nedocromil; Phenotype; Prednisolone",,"beclometasone dipropionate, 5534-09-8; budesonide, 51333-22-3, 51372-29-3; methacholine, 55-92-5; nedocromil, 69049-73-6, 69049-74-7; prednisone, 53-03-2; salbutamol, 18559-94-9, 35763-26-9","pulmicort, Astra Zeneca, United States; tilade, Rhone Poulenc, United States; vanceril, Schering Plough, United States","Astra Zeneca, United States; Rhone Poulenc, United States; Schering Plough, United States","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: R01HL016052, R01HL086601, R01HL093076, R01HL118455, R37HL066289, RC2HL101543, U01HL065899

Methods Questionnaires for primary screening were issued using the method of multi-stage stratified sampling. Suspected asthmatic children were given a second questionnaire, physical examination, medical history review, and auxiliary examination to confirm the diagnosis. Age-and sex-matched non-asthmatic children were randomly recruited to the control group. Results The number of valid questionnaires was 10 616 (5 444 males and 5 172 females). There were 308 confirmed asthma cases and the overall prevalence was 2.90%. The prevalence in boys was higher than that in girls (3.4% vs 2.4%). The prevalence in children under 3 years of age was 10.2%, which was higher than that in other age groups. The top three triggers for asthma attack in children were respiratory infection (94.2%), weather changes (89.0%), and exercise (35.1%). The most common asthma attack was moderate (71.8%), followed by mild (22.7%). Inhaled corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics were applied to 94.8% (292 cases), 74.7% (230 cases), and 90.9% (280 cases) of all patients, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated the following major risk factors for asthma: history of allergic rhinitis (OR=150.285, 95% CI: 31.934-707.264), history of eczema (OR=10.600, 95% CI: 1.054-106.624), history of atopic dermatitis (OR=31.368, 95% CI: 3.339-294.683), food allergies (OR=27.373, 95% CI: 2.670-280.621), method of birth (OR=2.853, 95% CI: 1.311-6.208), age of first antibiotic use (OR=0.384, 95% CI: 0.172-0.857), frequency of antibiotic use within 1 year of age (OR=9.940, 95% CI: 6.246-15.820), use of wall decorating materials (OR=2.108, 95% CI: 1.464-3.036), and use of heat supply in winter (OR=6.046, 95% CI: 1.034-35.362). Conclusions The prevalence of childhood asthma is associated with age and gender in Zhengzhou. Most asthma attacks are moderate, often triggered by respiratory infection. Treatment of asthma has been standardized, but still needs further improvement. History of allergic rhinitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis and food allergies, cesarean delivery, frequent use of antibiotics within 1 year of age, use of decorating materials on the wall, and use of heating in winter may increase risk for asthma, and use of antibiotics in older age is a protective factor against asthma in children.","Asthma; Child; Epidemiological survey; Risk factor","antibiotic agent; corticosteroid; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child; China; controlled study; eczema; female; food allergy; groups by age; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; multivariate logistic regression analysis; physical examination; preschool child; prevalence; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; respiratory tract infection; risk factor; stratified sample; urban area; weather; adolescent; asthma; infant; newborn; statistical model; Adolescent; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Epidemiologic Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Male; Questionnaires; Risk Factors",,,,,,,,,,"Mansour, E., Ahmed, A., Cortes, A., Mechanisms of metabisulfite-induced bronchoconstriction: Evidence for bradykinin B2-receptor stimulation[J] (1992) J Appl Physiol, 72 (5), pp. 1831-1837",,,,"Xiangya Hospital of CSU",,,,,10088830,,,"25523569","Chinese","Chin.

Methods: A Markov model was used to simulate over 6 years the incidence of AD, days with AD symptoms, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and AD-related direct and indirect (i.e., parents'/caregivers' productivity loss) costs incurred by hypothetical cohorts of healthy, at-risk infants fed with either PHF-W or SF as AD prevention for ≤ 17 weeks. Efficacy estimates of PHF-W versus SF in preventing AD were literature-based. The resources used to manage AD (by severity, age, and treatment modality) were estimated using clinical pathways derived from clinical expert opinion. Local costs were applied to resource use. Results were presented as point estimates and as 95 percent credible intervals (CIs, i.e., range of values around the point estimate that include 95% of model simulations) generated via multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte-Carlo simulation techniques. All costs are reported in Philippines pesos ([U+20B1], where [U+20B1]1000 = US $22.24). All reported outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3.5% per year. Results: Based on the 6-year simulation, compared with SF, PHF-W was predicted to result in a 14-percentage point reduction (i.e., 39% vs. 25%) (95% CI 0.09-0.19) in the incidence of AD and a gain of 0.03 (i.e., 5.46 vs. 5.43) (95% CI 0.01-0.07) QALYs/patient. PHF-W's higher feeding formula cost (+[U+20B1]1,304/patient) (95% CI -[U+20B1]3,090 to [U+20B1]5,779) were offset by reductions in AD-related costs (-[U+20B1]11,959/patient; i.e., [U+20B1]27,228 vs. [U+20B1]15,269) (95% CI -[U+20B1]14,685 to -[U+20B1]7,284), including, in particular, the costs of pharmacotherapy, formula used as treatment, and visits to physicians. As a result, PHF-W became a net cost-saving strategy within 38 weeks. Overall, PHF-W resulted in net savings of -[U+20B1]10,654 (-US $237) (CI -[U+20B1]4,240 [-US $94] to -[U+20B1]14,544 [-US $323]) (i.e., [U+20B1]27,228 [US $606] vs. [U+20B1]16,574 [US $369]). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of results; the most influential variable was the first-year risk reduction in AD. Conclusions: Based on the present modeling exercise, compared with SF, PHF-W appears to substantially reduce the risk of AD and its associated direct and indirect medical costs in healthy, at-risk urban Filipino infants over a 6-year period. © 2014 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).","Atopic dermatitis; Cost effectiveness; NAN-HA; Partially hydrolyzed whey formula; Prevention","milk protein; article; artificial milk; atopic dermatitis; clinical pathway; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; Filipino (people); health care cost; high risk population; human; incidence; infant; Monte Carlo method; partially hydrolyzed whey protein formula; prediction; priority journal; probability; productivity; quality adjusted life year; risk reduction; sensitivity analysis; urban population",,,,,,"Source of financial support: Partial research funding was received from the Nestlé Research Center, Lausanne, Switzerland, to conduct this study.",,,,"Spergel, J., Paller, A., Atopic dermatitis and the atopic march (2003) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 112, pp. S118-S127; Mack, C.M.C., Nebus, J., Management of patients with atopic dermatitis: the role of emollient therapy (2012) Dermatol Res Pract, 2012, p. 836931; Fennessy, M.C., Coupland, S., Popay, J., Naysmith, K., The epidemiology and experience of atopic eczema during childhood: a discussion paper on the implications of current knowledge for health care, public health policy and research (2000) J Epidemiol Community Health, 54, pp. 581-589; Asher, M., Montefort, S., Björkstén, B., Lai, C.K., ISAAC Phase Three Study Group.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between wheezing in children and indoor CO2 (a ventilation surrogate marker) in DCC and to identify behaviours and building characteristics potentially related to CO2. In phase I, 45 DCCs from Lisbon and Oporto (Portugal) were selected through a proportional stratified random sampling. In phase II, 3 months later, 19 DCCs were further reassessed after cluster analysis for the greatest difference comparison. In both phases, children's respiratory health was assessed by ISAAC-derived questionnaires. Indoor CO2 concentrations and building characteristics of the DCC were evaluated in both phases, using complementary methods. Mixed effect models were used to analyze the data. In phase I, which included 3,186 children (mean age 3.1±1.5 years), indoor CO2 concentration in the DCC rooms was associated with reported wheezing in the past 12 months (27.5 %) (adjusted odds ratio (OR) for each increase of 200 ppm 1.04, 95 % CI 1:01 to 1:07). In phase II, the association in the subsample of 1,196 children seen in 19 out of the initial 45 DCCs was not significant (adjusted OR 1.02, 95 % CI 0.96 to 1.08). Indoor CO2 concentration was inversely associated with the practices of opening windows and internal doors and with higher wind velocity. A positive trend was observed between CO2 and prevalence of reported asthma (4.7 %). Conclusion: Improved ventilation is needed to achieve a healthier indoor environment in DCC. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.","Children; Environmental health; Indoor air quality; Kindergarten; Ventilation","carbon dioxide;

Evidence points toward lifestyle as a major risk factor. AE is often the first symptom early in life later followed by food allergy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. Thus, there is a great need to find early, preferentially noninvasive, biomarkers to identify individuals that are predisposed to AE with the goal to prevent disease development. Objective: To investigate whether the protein abundances in vernix can predict later development of AE. Methods: Vernix collected at birth from 34 newborns within the Assessment of Lifestyle and Allergic Disease During INfancy (ALADDIN) birth cohort was included in the study. At 2 years of age, 18 children had developed AE. Vernix proteins were identified and quantified with liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Results: We identified and quantified 203 proteins in all vernix samples. An orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model was found with R2 = 0.85, Q2 = 0.39, and discrimination power between the AE and healthy group of 73.5%. Polyubiquitin-C and calmodulin-like protein 5 showed strong negative correlation to the AE group, with a correlation coefficient of 0.73 and 0.68, respectively, and a P-value of 8.2 E-7 and 1.8 E-5, respectively.

Objective To study intratonsillar/nasopharyngeal virus detections and in vivo expressions of T-cell- and innate immune response-specific cytokines, transcription factors, and type I/II/III interferons in human tonsils. Methods: Palatine tonsil samples were obtained from 143 elective tonsillectomy patients. Adenovirus, bocavirus-1, coronavirus, enteroviruses, influenza virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were detected using PCR. The mRNA expression levels of IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-28, IL-29, IL-37, TGF-β, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2, and Tbet were directly analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Results Fifty percentage of subjects reported allergy, 59% had ≥1 nasopharyngeal viruses, and 24% had ≥1 intratonsillar viruses. Tonsillar virus detection showed a strong negative association with age; especially rhinovirus or parainfluenza virus detection showed positive association with IFN-γ and Tbet expressions. IL-37 expression was positively associated with atopic dermatitis, whereas IFN-α, IL-13, IL-28, and Tbet expressions were negatively associated with allergic diseases. Network analyses demonstrated strongly polarized clusters of immune regulatory (IL-10, IL-17, TGF-β, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2, Tbet) and antiviral (IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-28, IL-29) genes. These two clusters became more distinctive in the presence of viral infection or allergy. A negative correlation between antiviral cytokines and IL-10, IL-17, IL-37, FOXP3, and RORC2 was observed only in the presence of viruses, and interestingly, IL-13 strongly correlated with antiviral cytokines. Conclusions: Tonsillar cytokine expression is closely related to existing viral infections, age, and allergic illnesses and shows distinct clusters between antiviral and immune regulatory genes. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Skindex-29 is a self-report questionnaire developed to measure dermatology-specific quality of life. Aim: The objective of this study is to adapt this questionnaire to Polish conditions. The adaptation procedure involved the works on the linguistic content of the items and testing psychometric properties of the Polish version of Skindex-29, including item characteristics, factorial structure, aspects of reliability and validity. Material and methods: Two-hundred and ninety patients (63.4% women and 35.2% men) suffering from a range of skin conditions were recruited from several dermatological out-patient and in-patient clinics in Poland. Quality of life was measured using Skindex-29 and appropriate clinical data were collected. Results: The global score of Skindex-29 showed the normal distribution. Cronbach's α reliability coeficients were found to be high to very high for all Skindex-29 indexes. Factor analysis yielded four factors, in contrast to the original version of the questionnaire, for which a three-factor solution had been reported. Skindex-29 validity was demonstrated by showing the differences in the quality of life scores across different diagnostic categories, and between in-patients and out-patients. Skindex-29 global scores were found to be significantly predicted by the localization of the skin lesions on legs, anogenital areas and palms. Conclusions: The findings of this study support reliability and validity of the Polish version of Skindex-29, but they also raise questions to its three-factor structure.","Psychodermatology; Psychometric assessment; Quality of life","acne vulgaris; adolescent; adult; aged; alopecia areata; arm; article; atopic dermatitis; bacterial skin disease; burn; condyloma; contact dermatitis; controlled study; dermatitis; dermatitis herpetiformis; dermatomycosis; eczema; erythema; face; female; furunculosis; genital system; hand palm; head; herpes zoster; human; keratoderma; leg; leg ulcer; lichen planus; lipoma; major clinical study; male; male type alopecia; middle aged; mycosis fungoides; neck; nevus; normal distribution; outpatient department; pemphigus; pityriasis; Poland; Polish version of Skindex 29 questionnaire; psoriasis; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; rosacea; self report; skin allergy; skin disease; skin pruritus; stria; superficial thrombophlebitis; systemic lupus erythematosus; systemic sclerosis; trunk; urticaria; validity; verruca vulgaris; very elderly; vitiligo; young adult",,,,,,,,,,"Finlay, A.Y., Coles, E.C., The efect of severe psoriasis on the quality of life of 369 patients (1995) Br J Dermatol, 132, pp. 236-244; Koo, J., Population-based epidemiologic study of psoriasis with emphasis on quality of life assessment (1996) Dermatologic Clinics, 14 (3), pp. 485-496. , DOI 10.1016/S0733-8635(05)70376-4; Lasek, R.J., Chren, M.-M., Acne vulgaris and the quality of life of adult dermatology patients (1998) Archives of Dermatology, 134 (4), pp. 454-458. , DOI 10.1001/archderm.134.4.454; Lundberg, L., Johannesson, M., Silverdahl, M., Hermansson, C., Lindberg, M., Health-related quality of life in patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis measured with SF-36, DLQI and a subjective measure of disease activity (2000) Acta Dermato-Venereologica, 80 (6), pp. 430-434. , DOI 10.1080/000155500300012873; Finlay, A.Y., Ryan, T.J., Disability and handicap in dermatology (1996) International Journal of Dermatology, 35 (5), pp. 305-311; Finlay, A.Y., Skin Disease Disability: Measuring Its Magnitude (1998) Keio Journal of Medicine, 47 (3), pp. 131-134; Finlay, A.Y., Khan, G.K., Luscombe, D.K., Salek, M.S., Validation of sickness impact profile and psoriasis disability index in psoriasis (1990) Br J Dermatol, 123, pp. 751-756; Salek, M.S., Finlay, A.Y., Luscombe, D.K., Cyklosporin greatly improves the quality of life of adults with severe atopic dermatitis (1993) Br J Dermatol, 129, pp. 422-430; Motley, R.J., Finlay, A.Y., How much disability is caused by acne?

None of the outcome measurements of atopic dermatitis (AD) are Zheng-specific. The effectiveness of TCM is likely to be underestimated without a Zheng-related symptom-specific instrument. The aim of this study was to develop an instrument for measuring the Zheng-related symptom-specific status of patients with AD.Methods: We followed standard methodology to develop the instrument, including item generation and selection, item reduction and presentation, and pretesting, and recruited 188 patients with AD involved in a six-center randomized-controlled trial (ChiCTR-TRC-08000156) to validate the questionnaire. We conducted construct validity, reliability, and responsiveness analysis. The standardized effect size (SES) and standardized response mean (SRM) were used to calculate the responsiveness of additional items and the total score for the rating items.Results: ZRADSQ has 15 items, with 12 rating items and 3 additional items. The 12 rating items fall within three domains: AD symptoms (n = 6 items); Heat (n = 4 items) and Mood (n = 2 items). Confirmatory factor analysis provided good support for a three-factor model (d.f. = 51, x2=97.11, RMSEA = 0.07, CFI = 0.96), and the Pearson's correlation coefficient between ZRADSQ and Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) was 0.40 (P &lt; 0.001). The reliability was also good, with a Cronbach's alpha value for ZRADSQ of 0.84, a split-half coefficient of 0.75, and a test-retest reliability coefficient of 0.98. The standardized effect size and standardized response mean were close to or larger than 1, which indicated moderate to good responsiveness.Conclusions: The ZRADSQ demonstrates promising reliability, validity, and responsiveness. It can be used to determine whether Zheng-specific or symptom-specific treatments relieve the symptom that is most bothersome the patient. © 2013 Wu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Atopic dermatitis; Development; Questionnaire; Symptom; Traditional Chinese medicine; Validation","adolescent; adult; article; atopic dermatitis; child; Chinese medicine; construct validity; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; named inventories, questionnaires and rating scales; outcome assessment; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; reliability; scoring system; test retest reliability; validation study; validity; Zheng related atopic dermatitis symptom questionnaire; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Dermatitis, Atopic; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Patient Outcome Assessment; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,"Leung, D.Y., Boguniewicz, M., Howell, M.D., Nomura, I., Hamid, Q.A., New insights into atopic dermatitis (2004) J Clin Invest, 113, pp. 651-657. , 351324, 14991059; Ellis, C.N., Drake, L.A., Prendergast, M.M., Abramovits, W., Boguniewicz, M., Daniel, C.R., Lebwohl, M., Tong, K.B., Cost of atopic dermatitis and eczema in the United States (2002) J Am Acad Dermatol, 46 (3), pp. 361-370. , 10.1067/mjd.2002.120528, 11862170; Boneberger, S., Rupec, R.A., Ruzicka, T., Complementary therapy for atopic dermatitis and other allergic skin diseases: facts and controversies (2010) Clin Dermatol, 28, pp. 57-61. , 10.1016/j.clindermatol.2009.03.017, 20082952; Hughes, R., Ward, D., Tobin, A.M., Keegan, K., Kirby, B., The use of alternative medicine in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis (2007) Pediatr Dermatol, 24, pp. 118-120. , 10.1111/j.1525-1470.2007.00355.x, 17461804; Ruta, D.A., Garratt, A.M., Leng, M., Russell, I.T., MacDonald, L.M., A new approach to the measurement of quality of life: the patient-generated index (1994) Med Care, 32, pp. 1109-1126. , 10.1097/00005650-199411000-00004, 7967852; Schmitt, J., Langan, S., Williams, H.C., What are the best outcome measurements for atopic eczema?

Psychological traits and lack of skills to cope with stress could be maintaining factors of AD. The first aim of the present study was to compare sense of coherence (SOC), depression, and anger among adult patients with AD, adults with remission from AD, and adults without AD. The second aim was to explore whether depression and anger have significant impacts on SOC. A cross-sectional survey was carried out from May to September of 2007. In total, 43 adult patients with AD, 32 adults with remission from AD, and 63 adults without AD participated. A one-way analysis of variance showed that adult patients with AD have significantly higher levels of depression than adults with remission from AD and adults without AD. Furthermore, structural equation modeling indicated a significant impact of depression on SOC across the three groups, along with a significant impact of anger suppression on depression, particularly in adult patients with AD. The findings of this study suggest that psychological traits have a negative impact on skills for coping with stress, and that this relationship might be a contributory factor for maintenance of AD. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","anger; atopic dermatitis; depression; sense of coherence","adaptive behavior; adolescent; adult; analysis of variance; anger; cross-sectional study; defense mechanism; depression; Dermatitis, Atopic; female; human; infant; male; middle aged; preschool child; pruritus; psychological model; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; recurrent disease; remission; sense of coherence; statistical model; young adult; article; atopic dermatitis; depression; psychological aspect; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anger; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; Models, Statistical; Pruritus; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Recurrence; Remission Induction; Remission, Spontaneous; Repression, Psychology; Sense of Coherence; Young Adult; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anger; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; Models, Statistical; Pruritus; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Recurrence; Remission Induction; Remission, Spontaneous; Repression, Psychology; Sense of Coherence; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,"Al Ahmar, H.F., Kurban, A.K., Psychological profile of patients with atopic dermatitis (1976) British Journal of Dermatology, 95, pp. 373-377; Antonovsky, A., (1979) A Health, Stress, and Coping: New Perspective on Mental and Physical Wellbeing, , San Francisco, CA Jossey-Bass; Antonovsky, A., (1987) Unraveling the Mystery of Health.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases with an estimated prevalence of 5%-30% in children. Objective To develop and validate a specific questionnaire which assess the burden of families of children with AD: the Atopic dermatitis Burden Scale (ABS). Methods Items for inclusion in ABS were initially generated from a literature review and a verbatim report from parents whose child had AD. ABS was refined via item reduction according to interquestion correlations, consensus among experts and exploratory factor analysis. Internal consistency was determined by calculating the Cronbach's α, concurrent validity by calculating the correlation between ABS and the Short-Form 12 items. Discriminant validity was analysed according to the severity degrees of AD assessed by Patient-Oriented SCORing index of Atopic Dermatitis (PO-SCORAD). Results From an initial list of 29 items, ABS was reduced to a 14-item questionnaire, grouped into four dimensions based on the exploratory factor analysis. Construct validity was demonstrated and ABS showed good internal coherence (Cronbach's α: 0.78). ABS was significantly correlated to the mental dimension of Short-Form 12 (r = -0.49), but it was not correlated to the physical dimension (r = 0.04). ABS scores were significantly different according to the severity degrees of AD, with higher ABS score in parents whose child had severe AD. Conclusion The ABS questionnaire is a validated tool for assessing the burden of families of children with AD. An implementation of a prospective study is planned to estimate sensitivity to change and to confirm its domain structure in larger samples. © 2013 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.",,"adult; article; atopic dermatitis; atopic dermatitis burden scale; child; concurrent validity; consensus; construct validity; discriminant validity; factorial analysis; family assessment; female; human; infant; internal consistency; literature; major clinical study; male; newborn; patient oriented scoring index of atopic dermatitis; preschool child; priority journal; questionnaire; school child; scoring system; Short Form 12; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Family; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Psychometrics; Questionnaires",,,,,,,,,,"Misery, L., Ortonne, J.P., Cambazard, F., PPAD: A tool for presumption of atopic dermatitis (2012) J Dermatol, 39, pp. 151-155; Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis (2008) N Engl J Med, 358, pp. 1483-1494; Darsow, U., Wollenberg, A., Simon, D., ETFAD/EADV eczema task force 2009 position paper on diagnosis and treatment of atopic dermatitis (2010) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 24, pp. 317-328; Ellis, C., Luger, T., Abeck, D., International Consensus Conference on Atopic Dermatitis II (ICCAD II): Clinical update and current treatment strategies (2003) Br J Dermatol, 148, pp. 3-10; Kalavala, M., Dohil, M.A., Calcineurin inhibitors in pediatric atopic dermatitis: A review of current evidence (2011) Am J Clin Dermatol, 12, pp. 15-24; Schmitt, J., Schmitt, N., Meurer, M., Cyclosporin in the treatment of patients with atopic eczema - A systematic review and meta-analysis (2007) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 21, pp. 606-619; Taieb, C., Sibaud, V., Merial-Kieny, C., Impact of Avène hydrotherapy on the quality of life of atopic and psoriatic patients (2011) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 25, pp. 24-29; Kiebert, G., Sorensen, S.V., Revicki, D., Atopic dermatitis is associated with a decrement in health-related quality of life (2002) Int J Dermatol, 41, pp. 151-158; Finlay, A.Y., Quality of life in atopic dermatitis (2001) J Am Acad Dermatol, 45, pp. S64-S66; Rehal, B., Armstrong, A.W., Health outcome measures in atopic dermatitis: A systematic review of trends in disease severity and quality-of-life instruments 1985-2010 (2011) PLoS ONE, 6, pp. e17520; Weber, M.B., Fontes Neto Pde, T., Prati, C., Improvement of pruritus and quality of life of children with atopic dermatitis and their families after joining support groups (2008) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 22, pp. 992-997; Koblenzer, C.S., Itching and the atopic skin (1999) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 104, pp. S109-S113; Dahl, R.E., Bernhisel-Broadbent, J., Scanlon-Holdford, S., Sleep disturbances in children with atopic dermatitis (1995) Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med, 149, pp. 856-860; Moore, K., David, T.J., Murray, C.S., Effect of childhood eczema and asthma on parental sleep and well-being: A prospective comparative study (2006) Br J Dermatol, 154, pp. 514-518; Whalley, D., McKenna, S.P., Dewar, A.L., A new instrument for assessing quality of life in atopic dermatitis: International development of the Quality of Life Index for Atopic Dermatitis (QoLIAD) (2004) Br J Dermatol, 150, pp. 274-283; McKenna, S.P., Whalley, D., Dewar, A.L., International development of the Parents' Index of Quality of Life in Atopic Dermatitis (PIQoL-AD) (2005) Qual Life Res, 14, pp. 231-241; Chamlin, S.L., Chren, M.M., Quality-of-life outcomes and measurement in childhood atopic dermatitis (2010) Immunol Allergy Clin North Am, 30, pp. 281-288; http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/, World Health Organization.

Objectives: To determine the structure of skin microbiome in patients with AD and its changes during an 18-day course of hydrotherapy and to assess the association between S. aureus and microorganism colonisation, local skin condition and AD severity. Methods: Three skin areas (xerotic, inflammatory and healthy) were identified in 25 moderate to severe AD patients for sampling before treatment, just after (day 1), and at day 10 and day 18. The structure of the bacterial community in the samples was assessed using a molecular biology approach based on 16S rRNA gene profiling. At each visit, AD severity was measured globally by the SCORAD index and at the lesional and healthy sampling sites. Results: Clustering analysis of 296 samples showed two different bacterial community profiles: one with 2 peaks corresponding to S. aureus, the other displayed multiple peaks, identified as diversified microflora. At baseline, xerotic areas seemed to be less colonised by S. aureus than inflammatory areas. After 18 days of hydrotherapy, the number of lesional sites colonised by S. aureus (p<0.05) and the SCORAD index (p<0.00001) were significantly reduced, mainly in inflammatory and moist areas, promoting the emergence of a diversified microflora. Conclusions:We identified two bacterial community profiles corresponding to S. aureus and diversified microflora. The competitive balance between both profiles appears to be a key element associated with the severity of AD lesions.","Atopic dermatitis; Hydrotherapy; Microbiome; Microflora; Staphylococcus aureus","corticosteroid; emollient agent; RNA 16S; adult; article; atopic dermatitis; bacterial colonization; capillary electrophoresis; clinical article; disease association; DNA extraction; female; gene library; genotyping technique; human; hydrotherapy; male; microbial community; microbiome; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; prospective study; single strand conformation polymorphism; skin flora; Staphylococcus aureus; xerosis; adolescent; Dermatitis, Atopic; genetics; genotype; hydrotherapy; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; severity of illness index; skin; staphylococcal skin infection; Staphylococcus aureus; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Genotype; Humans; Hydrotherapy; Male; Microbiota; Prospective Studies; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Severity of Illness Index; Skin; Staphylococcal Skin Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Young Adult",,"RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",,,,,,,,"Leung, D.Y., Bieber, T., Atopic Dermatitis (2003) Lancet, 361, pp. 151-160; Baurecht, H., Irvine, A.D., Novak, N., Toward a major risk factor for atopic eczema: Meta-analysis of filaggrin polymorphism data (2007) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 120, pp. 1406-1412; Zollner, T.M., Wichelhaus, T.A., Hartung, A., Colonisation with superantigen-producing Staphylococcus aureus is associated with increased severity of atopic dermatitis (2000) Clin Exp Allergy, 30, pp. 994-1000; Casas, C., Ginisty, H., Alvarez-Georges, S., Molecular characterisation of inflammation and Staphylococcus aureus colonisation of involved skin of atopic patients.

Assessing patients' atopic dermatitis and their parents' topical corticosteroid phobia is an essential step to improving adherence to treatment. Because topical corticophobia appears to be a complex phenomenon, its evaluation by binary responses (yes/no) is too simplistic. Thus, a scale is needed, which is capable of identifying the subtleties of topical corticosteroid phobia.Objectives:To develop and validate a scale, TOPICOP©, measuring worries and beliefs about topical corticosteroids among atopic dermatitis outpatients and their parents.Methods:An initial statistical validation of TOPICOP was carried out, collecting qualitative data about patients' topical corticophobia behaviors and beliefs using focus-group methodology. Then, 208 outpatients or their parents from five French centers completed a self-administered questionnaire built from focus-group results. The scale-development process comprised an explanatory principal component analysis, Cronbach's α-coefficients and structural equation modeling.Results:The validated questionnaire comprised 12 items, covering two important dimensions relative to ""worries"" (6 items) and ""beliefs"" (6 items). Psychometric properties showed that items had very good communality (>0.60) within their own dimension. The final two-factor solution accounted for 47.3% of the variance. Cronbach's α-coefficients were, respectively, 0.79 and 0.78. Structural equation modeling strongly supported the possibility of calculating a global score.Conclusions:TOPICOP© is the first scale aimed at assessing topical corticophobia in adult patients and parents of children with eczema. TOPICOP® has excellent psychometric properties and should be easy to use in everyday clinical practice for clinicians and researchers. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and validate TOPICOP© in other cultures. © 2013 Moret et al.",,"corticosteroid; adult; article; atopic dermatitis; Cronbach alpha coefficient; human; major clinical study; multicenter study; patient assessment; patient attitude; phobia; principal component analysis; psychometry; rating scale; structural equation modeling; topical corticophobia; topical corticophobia scale; validation study; Administration, Topical; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Child; Culture; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Linear Models; Outpatients; Parents; Phobic Disorders; Principal Component Analysis; Psychometrics",,,,,,,,,,"Williams, H.C., Burney, P.G., Pembroke, A.C., Hay, R.J., The U.K. Working Party's Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Dermatitis.

In order to develop more effective therapies, there is a need for objective measures to detect scratching. Wrist actigraphy, which detects wrist movements over time using microaccelerometers, has shown great promise in detecting scratch because it is lightweight, usable in the home environment, can record longitudinally, and does not require any wires. However, current actigraphy-based scratch-detection methods are limited in their ability to discriminate scratch from other nighttime activities. Our previous work demonstrated the separability of scratch from both walking and restless sleep using a clustering technique which employed four features derived from the actigraphic data: number of accelerations above 0.01 g's, epoch variance, peak frequency, and autocorrelation value at one lag. In this paper, we extended these results by employing these same features as independent variables in a logistic regression model. This allows us to directly estimate the conditional probability of scratching for each epoch. Our approach outperforms competing actigraphy-based approaches and has both high sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (0.92) for identifying scratch as validated on experimental data collected from 12 healthy subjects. The model must still be fully validated on clinical data, but shows promise for applications to clinical trials and longitudinal studies of scratch.","Atopic dermatitis; Generalized linear models; Logistic regression; Scratch","Atopic dermatitis; Auto-correlation value; Clustering techniques; Conditional probabilities; Generalized linear model; Logistic Regression modeling; Logistic regressions; Scratch; Regression analysis; Patient monitoring; accelerometry; actimetry; adult; article; atopic dermatitis; clothing; cluster analysis; equipment; female; human; male; methodology; physiology; pruritus; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; wrist; actimetry; devices; procedures; pruritus; Accelerometry; Actigraphy; Adult; Clothing; Cluster Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Pruritus; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Wrist; Accelerometry; Actigraphy; Adult; Clothing; Cluster Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Pruritus; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Wrist",,,,,,,,,,"Mortz, C.G., Lauritsen, J.M., Bindslev-Jensen, C., Andersen, K.E., Prevalence of atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and hand and contact dermatitis in adolescents.

The aim was to review all clinical and psychometric data on the use of the IDQoL from its inception in 2001 until November 2012, to serve as a single reference source. A literature search was carried out using Medline, PubMed, EBSCOhost, Science Direct and Google Scholar. Articles and abstracts that described the clinical use of the IDQoL and those that investigated its psychometric properties were included. Articles not in English were excluded. Fifty-one publications were identified, of which 46 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. IDQoL data relating to psychometric, descriptive and clinical practice research, drug trials and therapeutic interventions were extracted. The IDQoL has been translated into 21 languages and used in 18 countries, including two multinational studies. Thirty-one studies demonstrated its psychometric properties, such as test-retest reliability, internal consistency, validity, responsiveness to change and interpretability. No studies investigated dimensionality, carried out factor analysis or described the minimal clinically important difference of the tool. Eight studies used the IDQoL to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions such as education programmes, consultations and wet-wrap therapy, while seven studies described the use of IDQoL in topical interventions. When deciding whether to use the IDQoL, researchers and clinicians should consider the validation data, the relevant comparative clinical data available and the potential burden on the respondents. What's already known about this topic? The quality of life of infants may be severely affected by atopic dermatitis. As infants cannot answer questions, proxy methods are needed to measure their life quality. The Infants' Dermatitis Quality of Life Index (IDQoL) has been widely used for such assessment. What does this study add? The IDQoL has been used in 46 published studies in 18 countries. This review collates the scattered data about the wide use of the IDQoL in clinical and psychometric studies. Seven studies used the IDQoL in assessment of topical therapy and eight in assessment of other treatment interventions. Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, validity, responsiveness to change and interpretability of the IDQoL have been reported across 31 studies. © 2013 British Association of Dermatologists.",,"15 methyllipoxin A;

We report here the validation of the German version (GerItchyQoL) of the frst pruritus-specifc QoL instrument ItchyQoL. GerItchyQoL was created from the original version following standard protocols. It was completed by 308 patients with chronic pruritus of different origin and tested for validity, reliability and responsiveness. Factor analysis of Ger-ItchyQoL revealed the 4 domains symptoms, functioning, feelings, and self-perception. Reliability was demonstrated by good internal consistency of all domains. We confrmed convergent validity by comparing the instrument with itch severity, as measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-10), and with the Short-Form-12 (SF-12), a widely used generic health-related QoL instrument. Concurrent validity was shown by the ability to discriminate between patient groups of different itch severity. Changes in GerItchyQoL scores correlated with changes in itch severity (VAS), suggesting responsiveness of the German tool. This study provides preliminary evidence of validity, reliability and responsiveness of GerItchyQoL and also shows a high impact of chronic pruritus on QoL. Further translations of ItchyQoL into additional languages will enable large-scale international, multilingual trials. © 2013 The Authors.","Itch; ItchyQol; Pruritus; Quality of life","adolescent; adult; aged; article; atopic dermatitis; chronic pruritus; clinical assessment tool; concurrent validity; convergent validity; disease severity; face validity; female; german version of itchy quality of life; human; internal consistency; kidney disease; liver disease; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prurigo; pruritus; psoriasis; quality of life index; reliability; self concept; Short Form 12; symptom; urticaria; visual analog scale; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chi-Square Distribution; Chronic Disease; Cost of Illness; Discriminant Analysis; Emotions; Female; Germany; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Predictive Value of Tests; Pruritus; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Self Concept; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,"Ständer, S., Weisshaar, E., Mettang, T., Szepietowski, J.C., Carstens, E., Ikoma, A., Clinical classifcation of itch: A position paper of the International Forum for the Study of Itch (2007) Acta Derm Venereol, 87, pp. 291-294; Metz, M., Ständer, S., Chronic pruritus - pathogenesis, clinical aspects and treatment (2010) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 24, pp. 1249-1260; Ständer, S., Schafer, I., Phan, N.Q., Blome, C., Herberger, K., Heigel, H., Prevalence of chronic pruritus in Germany: Results of a cross-sectional study in a sample working population of 11,730 (2010) Dermatology, 221, pp. 229-235; Matterne, U., Apfelbacher, C.J., Loerbroks, A., Schwarzer, T., Buttner, M., Ofenloch, R., Prevalence, correlates and characteristics of chronic pruritus: A population-based cross-sectional study (2011) Acta Derm Venereol, 91, pp. 674-679; Tessari, G., Dalle Vedove, C., Loschiavo, C., Tessitore, N., Rugiu, C., Lupo, A., The impact of pruritus on the quality of life of patients undergoing dialysis: A single centre cohort study (2009) J Nephrol, 22, pp. 241-248; Weisshaar, E., Apfelbacher, C., Jager, G., Zimmermann, E., Bruckner, T., Diepgen, T.L., Pruritus as a leading symptom: Clinical characteristics and quality of life in German and Ugandan patients (2006) Br J Dermatol, 155, pp. 957-964; Guyatt, G.H., Feeny, D.H., Patrick, D.L., Measuring health-related quality of life (1993) Ann Intern Med, 118, pp. 622-629; Bullinger, M., Assessing health related quality of life in medicine.

It may cause occupational contact dermatitis and asthma. Many traditional and naturistic preparations may contain their extracts, hence sensitization may occur by several routes. Objective: To determine the prevalence of sensitization to Hedera helix pollen by skin prick test on allergic subjects. Material and methods: Skin prick tests (SPT) with 24 pollen extracts, including Hedera helix extract, were performed on 62 patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, allergic conjunctivitis and atopic dermatitis. It was determined the frequency of sensitization to pollen extracts and the differences in the reactivity patterns among patients who showed a positive or negative result with Hedera helix extract. A cluster analysis was made to identify cross-allergenicity among pollen extracts. Results: Eleven out of 62 (17.7%) patients had a positive SPT with common ivy pollen extract. The main differences found were the number of pollen species to which patients were allergic. Patients with atopic dermatitis had a nine-fold higher frequency of positive skin tests with Hedera extracts, than subjects with other allergic diseases. Conclusions: Hedera hélix pollen extract is a frequent cause of sensitization among allergic patients, and show crossallergenicity with pollen from different sources. There is a higher frequency of positive skin tests with Hedera extract in patients with atopic dermatitis than with other allergies.","Allergen; Common ivy; Hedera helix; Pollen; Sensitization","hedelix; pollen extract; allergenicity; allergic asthma; allergic conjunctivitis; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; article; atopic dermatitis; cluster analysis; human; ivy; major clinical study; prick test; sensitization; skin test; Adolescent; Adult; Allergens; Child; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Hedera; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pollen; Prevalence; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,"http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/hiedra, consultada el 05 de agosto del 2011; Metcalfe, D.J., Hedera helix (2005) Journal of Ecology, 93, pp. 632-648; Dimitri, M., Hedera helix (1987) Enciclopedia Argentina de Agricultura Y Jardinería, 1, p. 148. , Editorial ACME, Buenos Aires.

AD is a frequent disease among children and has a substantial impact on the lives of both the child and its family. A better understanding of the disease would enable better treatment, prevention and information to the families involved. Previous risk factor studies have been hampered by an unsuitable study design and/or difficulties in standardization when diagnosing AD, which limit their conclusions. In paper I, we conducted a traditional cross-sectional analysis testing 40 possible risk factors for developing AD at 3 years of age. Our data suggested a strong heredity of AD and confirmed the risk associated with the non-functional FLG allele mutations after adjustments for confounders. Besides this mother's dermatitis and father's allergic rhinitis were found to increase the risk of AD. Perinatal exposure to dog was the only environmental exposure that significantly reduced the disease manifestation, suggesting other, yet unknown environmental factors affecting the increasing prevalence of AD in children. Length at birth was shown to be inversely associated with the risk of later developing AD. This traditional risk factor analysis led to two borderline significant results: duration of exclusive breastfeeding and mother's alcohol intake during the 3rd trimester. Since these possible two risk factors could neither be rejected nor accepted, we decided to do two in-depth studies, further investigating these, using longitudinal data information and data analysis instead of the traditional cross-sectional approach (paper II & III). In paper II, we investigated the risk of developing AD and wheezy symptoms until age 2 years depending on duration of breastfeeding. We found an increased risk of AD, but a protective effect on wheezy disorders in infancy from exclusive breastfeeding. The effect of exclusive breastfeeding on the risk of development of AD was significant after adjustment for demographics, FLG variants R501X and 2282del4 status, parent's AD and pets at home (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15-3.80, p=0.016). In addition, there was a significant effect of duration of exclusive breastfeeding (p=0.043), as the relative risk of AD was increased in proportion to increased duration of breastfeeding. The risk associated with exclusive breastfeeding was not explained by the fatty acid composition of mother's milk, though a trend showed higher risk of AD if mother's milk had low concentrations of n-3 fatty acids. In paper III, we found that alcohol intake during pregnancy was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing AD in the offspring, with the effect persisting throughout the whole 7 years follow-up period (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.05-1.99, p=0.024). The increased risk was still significant after confounder adjustment for mother's education, AD and smoking habits during the 3rd trimester. There was no association between alcohol intake during pregnancy and other atopic endpoints (wheeze episodes, asthma, allergic rhinitis, blood eosinophil count, total IgE, sensitization, cord blood IgE and nasal eosinophilia). However, the underlying explanation was not clear. The thesis is based on data collected as part of the ongoing COPSAC cohort. The cohort is a longitudinal, prospective birth cohort following 411 children born to mothers with asthma. This selection of high-risk children restricts the interpretation of the results and they cannot necessarily be expanded to apply to the general population.",,"genetic marker; asthma; breast feeding; cross-sectional study; Dermatitis, Atopic; drinking behavior; female; follow up; genetic marker; genotype environment interaction; human; infant; male; maternal behavior; Monte Carlo method; newborn; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prenatal exposure; preschool child; probability; prospective study; Respiratory Sounds; risk; risk assessment; risk factor; statistical model; survival; Alcohol Drinking; Asthma; Breast Feeding; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genetic Markers; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Male; Markov Chains; Maternal Behavior; Monte Carlo Method; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Prospective Studies; Respiratory Sounds; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis",,"Genetic Markers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22451919,,,"23809981","English","Dan Med J",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894620093

We developed an abbreviated version of QPCAD (QP9) to reduce the burden of respondents and to popularize the evaluation of QOL in clinical practice, and evaluated its reliability, validity, and responsiveness. Methods: We applied factor analysis to the data of primary caregivers of AD children at the age of 0 to 6, tried to select the items of QP9. Next, we evaluated the reliability of QP9 based on the data of reliability analysis set of caregivers. We also examined the associations of scores of QP9 with background characteristics and the AD severity index for the validity analysis. In addition, we examined associations of the amount of change of scores with that of the AD severity index for the responsiveness analysis. Results: We selected the items of QP9 consisting of 9 items based on the data of 529 primary caregivers. We confirmed sufficient reliability of the item scores. We found the expected associations between the scores and background characteristics and AD severity. We also found the association between the amount of change of pre- and post-treatment scores and that of the AD severity. Conclusions: QP9 must be a useful questionnaire with sufficient reliability, validity, and responsiveness, as a QOL scale of primary caregivers of AD children. ©2013 Japanese Society of Allergology.","Atopic dermatitis; Caregivers; Qol questionnaire; Validity; Veliability","article; atopic dermatitis; caregiver; child care; clinical practice; disease severity; factorial analysis; quality of life index; questionnaire; reliability; validation study; validity; Adult; Caregivers; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results",,,,,,,,,,"Williams, H.C., Clinical practice.

Filaggrin is enzymatically degraded to natural moisturizing factor (NMF) in the stratum corneum (SC). In vivo Raman spectra of human skin can be used to quantify the NMF concentration in SC and thereby identify carriers of a loss-of-function mutation in the gene coding for filaggrin, which results in decreased NMF content. Here, we demonstrate that strongly reduced Raman spectral information is sufficient to make this differentiation. This is an important step towards development of a dedicated diagnostic device of reduced complexity, size and cost as compared to current state-of-the-art Raman equipment. A genetic algorithm was used to select the spectral regions needed to classify skin based on normal or reduced NMF content in SC. Using the NMF content based on full spectral information as gold standard, only four Raman regions were required to create a linear discriminant analysis model that can differentiate between skin with low NMF and skin with normal NMF with a prediction accuracy of 93 %.

Methods A community-based study was undertaken in three major cities in China, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, from November 2009 to January 2010. The participants in the study were screened by cluster sampling, and were investigated by interview at their own homes. A questionnaire, including skin sensitivity, the occurrence of burning, prickling or irritating sensations correlated with the factors, history of skin diseases and skin types, was given to each participant aged over 15 years. Results Totally 9154 questionnaires were completed (3931 men and 5223 women). The mean prevalence of very sensitive and sensitive skin in three cities was 13% (17.12% in Beijing, 9.10% in Shanghai and 22.39% in Guangzhou.) The mean prevalence was 8.62% in men and 15.93% in women, with significant difference between men and women in three selected cities (P < 0.001). The total prevalence of very sensitive and sensitive skin was 16.44% in <25 years group, 14.14% in 25-49 years group and 9.73% in ≥50 years group. Moreover, 18.54% of participants claimed with dry skin, 16.70% with greasy skin and 8.04% with normal skin claimed to have the symptoms of sensitive skin. Conclusions The prevalence of sensitive skin in the three cities of China is much lower than that in Europe and the United States. There was significant difference of the prevalence of sensitive skin among three cities located in different climatic and latitude regions and between men and women. The prevalence gradually decreased with the increasing age.

Currently it is well accepted that allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis are not single diseases, but syndromes encompassing different diseases entities. Therefore, it is important to cluster allergic disease patients to assess prognosis or the choice of therapeutic drugs, and useful biomarkers are required for these purposes. Periostin, an extracellular matrix protein, has recently emerged as a biomarker useful for clustering asthma patients. We further found that periostin plays an important role in allergic inflammation and based on this finding we are now developing therapeutic agents targeting periostin against allergic diseases. Since periostin is involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases in addition to allergic diseases, such diagnostics and therapeutic agents can be applied to many inflammatory diseases. In this article, we describe the history of periostin research and our application of basic research to the development of diagnostics and therapeutic agents against inflammatory diseases.",,"biological marker; cell adhesion molecule; cytokine; POSTN protein, human; animal; blood; human; hypersensitivity; immunology; inflammation; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; Animals; Biological Markers; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cytokines; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Inflammation; Molecular Targeted Therapy",,"Biological Markers; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cytokines; POSTN protein, human",,,,,,,,,"Izuhara, K.email: kizuhara@cc.saga-u.ac.jp",,,,,,,,00471860,,,"24371994","Japanese","Rinsho Byori",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893082978

We sought to determine the impact of specific climatic factors on the prevalence of AD in the United states. We used a merged analysis of the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) from a representative sample of 91,642 children aged 0-17 years and the 2006-2007 National Climate Data Center and Weather Service measurements of relative humidity (%), indoor heating degree days (HDD), clear-sky UV indices, ozone levels, and outdoor air temperature. As a proxy for AD, we used an affirmative response to the NSCH survey question asking whether the participant's child has been given a doctor diagnosis of ""eczema or any other kind of skin allergy"" in the previous 12 months. In multivariate models controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, age, and household income, eczema prevalence was significantly lower with the highest-quartile mean annual relative humidity (logistic regression, adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=0.82 (0.71-0.96), P=0.01) and issued UV index (0.73 (0.64-0.84), P<0.0001), and with two other factors associated with increased UV exposure. Eczema prevalence was decreased with the highest-quartile air temperature (0.80 (0.70-0.92), P=0.002) but increased with third-quartile mean annual HDD (1.26 (1.11-1.43), P=0.0003).

AD is a frequent disease among children and has a substantial impact on the lives of both the child and its family. A better understanding of the disease would enable better treatment, prevention and information to the families involved. Previous risk factor studies have been ham-pered by an unsuitable study design and/or difficulties in stand-ardization when diagnosing AD, which limit their conclusions. In paper I, we conducted a traditional cross-sectional analysis testing 40 possible risk factors for developing AD at 3 years of age. Our data suggested a strong heredity of AD and confirmed the risk associated with the non-functional FLG allele mutations after adjustments for confounders. Besides this mother's derma-titis and father's allergic rhinitis were found to increase the risk of AD. Perinatal exposure to dog was the only environmental expo-sure that significantly reduced the disease manifestation, suggest-ing other, yet unknown environmental factors affecting the in-creasing prevalence of AD in children. Length at birth was shown to be inversely associated with the risk of later developing AD.This traditional risk factor analysis led to two borderline signifi-cant results: duration of exclusive breastfeeding and mother's alcohol intake during the 3rd trimester. Since these possible two risk factors could neither be rejected nor accepted, we decided to do two in-depth studies, further investigating these, using longi-tudinal data information and data analysis instead of the tradi-tional cross-sectional approach (paper II & III). In paper II, we investigated the risk of developing AD and wheezy symptoms until age 2 years depending on duration of breastfeed-ing. We found an increased risk of AD, but a protective effect on wheezy disorders in infancy from exclusive breastfeeding. The effect of exclusive breastfeeding on the risk of development of AD was significant after adjustment for demographics, FLG variants R501X and 2282del4 status, parent's AD and pets at home (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15-3.80, p=0.016). In addition, there was a signifi-cant effect of duration of exclusive breastfeeding (p=0.043), as the relative risk of AD was increased in proportion to increased duration of breastfeeding. The risk associated with exclusive breastfeeding was not explained by the fatty acid composition of mother's milk, though a trend showed higher risk of AD if moth-er's milk had low concentrations of n-3 fatty acids. In paper III, we found that alcohol intake during pregnancy was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing AD in the offspring, with the effect persisting throughout the whole 7 years follow-up period (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.05-1.99, p=0.024). The in-creased risk was still significant after confounder adjustment for mother's education, AD and smoking habits during the 3rd tri-mester. There was no association between alcohol intake during pregnancy and other atopic endpoints (wheeze episodes, asthma, allergic rhinitis, blood eosinophil count, total IgE, sensitization, cord blood IgE and nasal eosiniphilia). However, the underlying explanation was not clear. The thesis is based on data collected as part of the ongoing COPSAC cohort. The cohort is a longitudinal, prospective birth cohort following 411 children born to mothers with asthma. This selection of high-risk children restricts the interpretation of the results and they cannot necessarily be expanded to apply to the general population.",,"nicotine; alcohol consumption; allergy; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; body height; breast feeding; breast milk; clinical trial (topic); disease exacerbation; dog; environmental exposure; family history; follow up; genotype; human; lipid composition; mutation; nonhuman; pregnancy; rhinitis; risk assessment; risk factor; sensitization; temperature; wheezing",,"nicotine, 54-11-5",,,,,,,,"Schultz, L.F., Hanifin, J.M., Secular change in the occurrence of atopic dermatitis (1992) Acta Derm Venereol Suppl (Stockh), 176, pp. 7-12; Schultz, L.F., Diepgen, T., Svensson, A., The occurrence of atopic dermatitis in north Europe: An international questionnaire study (1996) J Am Acad Dermatol, 34 (5 PART 1), pp. 760-764; Ben-Gashir, M.A., Relationship between quality of life and disease severity in atopic dermatitis/eczema syndrome during childhood (2003) Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol, 3 (5), pp. 369-373; Alanne, S., Nermes, M., Soderlund, R., Laitinen, K., Quality of life in infants with atopic dermatitis and healthy infants: A follow-up from birth to 24 months (2011) Acta Paediatr, 100 (8), pp. e65-e70; O'Connell, E.J., The burden of atopy and asthma in chil-dren (2004) Allergy, 59 (SUPPL. 78), pp. 7-11; (2006), Handbook of atopic eczema. 2nd ed.

We aimed to characterize the clinical presentation and course of atopic dermatitis associated with filaggrin mutations within the first 7 years of life. Method: The COPSAC cohort is a prospective, clinical birth cohort study of 411 children born to mothers with a history of asthma followed during their first 7 years of life with scheduled visits every 6 months, as well as visits for acute exacerbations of dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis was defined in accordance with international guidelines and described at every visit using 35 predefined localizations and 10 different characteristics. Results: A total of 170 (43%) of 397 Caucasian children developed atopic dermatitis. The R501X and/or 2282del4 filaggrin null mutations were present in 26 (15%) of children with atopic dermatitis and were primarily associated with predilection to exposed skin areas (especially the cheeks and back of the hands) and an up-regulation of both acute and chronic dermatitis. Furthermore, we found the filaggrin mutations to be associated with a higher number of unscheduled visits (3.6 vs. 2.7; p = 0.04) and more severe (moderate-severe SCORAD 44% vs. 31%; p = 0.14), and widespread dermatitis (10% vs. 6% of the body area, p<0.001) with an earlier age at onset (246 vs. 473 days, p<0.0001) compared to wild-type. Conclusion: In children, filaggrin mutations seem to define a specific endotype of atopic dermatitis primarily characterized by predilection to exposed areas of the body, in particular hands and cheeks, and an up-regulation in both acute and chronic morphological markers. Secondary, this endotype is characterized by an early onset of dermatitis and a more severe course, with more generalized dermatitis resulting in more frequent medical consultations. © 2012 Carson et al.",,"filaggrin; article; atopic dermatitis; child; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; discriminant analysis; disease course; disease exacerbation; disease severity; gene mutation; heterozygosity; homozygosity; human; major clinical study; morphology; phenotype; practice guideline; preschool child; prospective study; school child; upregulation; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Denmark; Dermatitis, Atopic; European Continental Ancestry Group; Genotype; Humans; Infant; Intermediate Filament Proteins; Mutation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Statistics, Nonparametric",,"Intermediate Filament Proteins; filaggrin",,,,,,,,"Irvine, A.D., Fleshing out filaggrin phenotypes (2007) J Invest Dermatol, 127, pp. 504-507; Candi, E., Schmidt, R., Melino, G., The cornified envelope: a model of cell death in the skin (2005) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, 6, pp. 328-340; Gruber, R., Elias, P.M., Crumrine, D., Lin, T.K., Brandner, J.M., Filaggrin genotype in ichthyosis vulgaris predicts abnormalities in epidermal structure and function (2011) Am J Pathol, 178, pp. 2252-2263; Sergeant, A., Campbell, L.E., Hull, P.R., Porter, M., Palmer, C.N., Heterozygous null alleles in filaggrin contribute to clinical dry skin in young adults and the elderly (2009) J Invest Dermatol, 129, pp. 1042-1045; Thyssen, J.P., Ross-Hansen, K., Johansen, J.D., Zachariae, C., Carlsen, B.C., Filaggrin loss-of-function mutation R501X and 2282del4 carrier status is associated with fissured skin on the hands: results from a cross-sectional population study (2012) Br J Dermatol, 166, pp. 46-53; O'Regan, G.M., Kemperman, P.M., Sandilands, A., Chen, H., Campbell, L.E., Raman profiles of the stratum corneum define 3 filaggrin genotype-determined atopic dermatitis endophenotypes (2010) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 126, pp. 574-580; Kezic, S., O'Regan, G.M., Yau, N., Sandilands, A., Chen, H., Levels of filaggrin degradation products are influenced by both filaggrin genotype and atopic dermatitis severity (2011) Allergy; Palmer, C.N., Irvine, A.D., Terron-Kwiatkowski, A., Zhao, Y., Liao, H., Common loss-of-function variants of the epidermal barrier protein filaggrin are a major predisposing factor for atopic dermatitis (2006) Nat Genet, 38, pp. 441-446; Marenholz, I., Nickel, R., Ruschendorf, F., Schulz, F., Esparza-Gordillo, J., Filaggrin loss-of-function mutations predispose to phenotypes involved in the atopic march (2006) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 118, pp. 866-871; Weidinger, S., Illig, T., Baurecht, H., Irvine, A.D., Rodriguez, E., Loss-of-function variations within the filaggrin gene predispose for atopic dermatitis with allergic sensitizations (2006) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 118, pp. 214-219; Worldwide variation in prevalence of symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and atopic eczema: ISAAC.

Convergent and discriminative validity was explored by analysing the associations of the ISS total score and the individual ISS component scores with age, sex, diagnosis, disease severity, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, anxiety, non-specific somatic symptoms, and pruritus-related quality of life impairment. Patients with urticaria reported significantly (p < 0.05) greater pruritus severity scores than the remaining patient groups, and pruritus severity was significantly associated with impaired sleep quality, more depressive symptoms, higher levels of anxiety, more non-specifc somatic symptoms, and impaired quality of life. The results also confirmed the multidimensional nature of pruritus, with the affective dimension of pruritus being a better predictor of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life impairment than the sensory dimension. Finally, our results confirmed previous findings that the associations between pruritus severity and depressive symptoms and somatic symptoms were partly mediated by the effect of pruritus on sleep quality. © 2012 The Authors.","Anxiety; Depression; Pruritus; Quality of life; Sleep impairment","adult; anxiety; article; atopic dermatitis; congenital blood vessel malformation; controlled study; convergent validity; depression; discriminative validity; disease severity; female; genital pruritus; human; Itch Severity Scale; major clinical study; male; nephrogenic pruritus; priority journal; pruritus; psoriasis; quality of life; rating scale; sleep quality; urticaria; validity; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Chi-Square Distribution; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Denmark; Depression; Discriminant Analysis; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Predictive Value of Tests; Principal Component Analysis; Pruritus; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Severity of Illness Index; Sleep Disorders; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,"Yosipovitch, G., Goon, A., Wee, J., Chan, Y.H., Goh, C.L., The prevalence and clinical characteristics of pruritus among patients with extensive psoriasis (2000) Br J Dermatol, 143, pp. 969-973; Buske-Kirschbaum, A., Geiben, A., Hellhammer, D., Psycho-biological aspects of atopic dermatitis: An overview (2001) Psycho-ther Psychosom, 70, pp. 6-16; Kosmadakis, G.C., Zerefos, N., Uremic pruritus (2006) Int J Artif Organs, 29, pp. 938-943; Gupta, M.A., Gupta, A.K., Kirkby, S., Weiner, H.K., Mace, T.M., Schork, N.J., Pruritus in psoriasis.

The prevalence of allergic disease is increasing in Korea, but the relationship between allergic symptoms and stress is not empirically well known. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between allergy-related symptoms and stress in children and adolescents. Methods: We investigated 698 children and adolescents living in Gwangyang Bay, Korea, using a multi-stage cluster sampling method. Using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood and the Psychosocial Well-being Index, these subjects were surveyed on allergy-related symptoms and psychosocial stressors in their lives, respectively. We used a multivariate logistic analysis for odds ratios for the complaint rate of allergic symptoms, after adjusting for age, gender, household income, body mass index, and residence. Results: After adjustments, lifetime rhinitis (odds ratio [OR], 1.024), rhinoconjunctivitis (OR, 1.090), diagnosis of itchy eczema (OR, 1.040), treatment of itchy eczema (OR, 1.049), 12-month allergic conjunctivitis (OR, 1.026), diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis (OR, 1.031), and treatment of allergic conjunctivitis (OR, 1.034) were found to be signifcantly associated with stress. Conclusions: Our results support the notion that there is a relationship between stress and allergic symptoms in children and adolescents.

We hypothesized that variation in the GM correlated with variation in clinical parameters of a murine oxazolone-induced skin inflammation model of atopic dermatitis. BALB/cA mice were sensitized with oxazolone over a 28-d period and variation in gastrointestinal microbiota in fecal and cecal samples was assessed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Clinical parameters included transepidermal water loss, ear thickness, inflammatory factors in ear tissue and plasma, and histopathologic evaluation. The fecal microbiota before induction of skin inflammation strongly correlated with the levels of some proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, IL1β, IL12, and TNFα), the antiinflammatory cytokines IL4 and IL10, and the chemokine KC/GRO that were measured in ear samples at study termination. Cecal microbiota at termination correlated with ear thickness and transepidermal water loss. There was no correlation between cytokine responses and ear thickness or transepidermal water loss. In addition, GM changed during the study period in the oxazolone-treated mice, whereas this was not the case for the control mice. The current study shows that the GM of mice influences the development of oxazolone-induced skin inflammation and that the model itself likely induces a pathophysiologic response that alters the composition of the GM.

Although dermatology data were not used in its development, the use of the EQ-5D questionnaire has been encouraged by the requirement of health technology assessment agencies for utility comparisons informing reimbursement decisions. The aim of this review was to examine the use of the EQ-5D in dermatology and to consider its future role in the economic evaluation of skin diseases. Published studies reporting the use of the EQ-5D in the economic analysis of skin diseases were carefully examined. Nineteen articles and 1 abstract published between 2003 and 2011 were identified, in which cost-of-illness, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were described. The EQ-5D is not a dermatology-specific measure, and it is not yet clear whether it is the most appropriate measure to support economic evaluation in the context of dermatology. Copyright © 2012 S.

AIT was introduced 100 years ago but remained an empirical treatment for more than 40 years, when the first controlled trial in 1954 opened the era of scientific evidence. A major advance was the introduction of venom immunotherapy to prevent anaphylaxis from insect stings in 1978. Concerning inhalant allergens, currently AIT may be administered in two forms, subcutaneous (SCIT), and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). A large number of trials, globally analyzed in a number of meta-analyses, gave sound evidence to the efficacy and safety of SCIT and SLIT in allergic rhinitis and asthma. Adverse systemic reactions are still a drawback for SCIT, while safety and tolerability of SLIT are very good, provided recommended doses and schedules of administration are used. A significant advance for SLIT development was the registration in Europe of the standardized quality tablets. New applications, such as food allergy and atopic dermatitis, as well as new routes of administration, are currently under evaluation. After 100 years of use, AIT has a central role in the management of allergy and the ongoing improvement seems able to warrant to AIT an even brighter future.","Allergy; Asthma; Efficacy; Rhinitis; Safety; Specific immunotherapy; Venom immunotherapy","adrenalin; allergen; ant venom; bee venom; chlorpheniramine maleate; Hymenoptera venom; immunomodulating agent; omalizumab; placebo; recombinant allergen; allergic asthma; allergic reaction; allergic rhinitis; anaphylaxis; atopic dermatitis; bronchus hyperreactivity; cell function; cluster analysis; drug efficacy; drug safety; food allergy; house dust allergy; human; insect sting; mastocytosis; meta analysis; meta analysis (topic); mortality; observational study; pollen allergy; randomized controlled trial (topic); respiratory tract allergy; retrospective study; review; risk; statistical significance; subcutaneous immunotherapy; sublingual immunotherapy; tablet; Clinical Trials as Topic; Desensitization, Immunologic; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans",,"adrenalin, 51-43-4, 55-31-2, 6912-68-1; chlorpheniramine maleate, 113-92-8; omalizumab, 242138-07-4",,,,,,,,"Bousquet, J., Lockey, R., Malling, H.J., Allergen immunotherapy: Therapeutic vaccines for allergic diseases (1998) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 102, pp. 558-562. , (eds).

The purpose of the study was to validate and assess the sensitivity to change of a new questionnaire to measure HRQOL in patients with psoriasis (PSO-LIFE).Methods: Observational, prospective, multicenter study performed in centers around Spain. Patients with active or inactive psoriasis completed the PSO-LIFE together with other Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) and Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI). A control group of patients with urticaria or atopic dermatitis was also included. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the PSO-LIFE were assessed by calculating Cronbach's alpha and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Validity was assessed by examining factorial structure, the capacity to discriminate between groups, and correlations with other measures. Sensitivity to change was measured using effect sizes.Results: The final sample included for analysis consisted of 304 patients and 56 controls. Mean (SD) age of psoriasis patients was 45.3 (14.5) years compared to 38.8 (14) years for controls (p < 0.01). Cronbach's alpha for the PSO-LIFE was 0.95 and test-retest reliability using the ICC was 0.98. Factor analysis showed the questionnaire to be unidimensional. Mean (SD) PSO-LIFE scores differed between patients with psoriasis and controls (64.9 [22.5] vs 69.4 [17.3]; p < 0.05), between those with active and inactive disease (57.4 [20.4] vs 76.4 [20.6]; p < 0.01), and between those with visible and non-visible lesions (63.0 [21.9] vs. 74.8 [23.9]; p < 0.01). The correlation between PSO-LIFE and PASI scores was moderate (r = -0.43) while correlations with DLQI and PDI dimensions ranged from moderate to high (between 0.4 and 0.8). Effect size on the PSO-LIFE in patients reporting 'much improved' health status at study completion was 1.01 (large effect size).Conclusions: The present results provide substantial support for the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the PSO-LIFE questionnaire in the population for which it was designed. © 2012 Dauden et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Psoriasis; Quality of life; Questionnaire; Validation","adult; article; atopic dermatitis; controlled study; dermatology quality of life index; female; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; named inventories, questionnaires and rating scales; observational study; prospective study; psoriasis; psoriasis disability index; psoriasis quality of life questionnaire; quality of life; quality of life index; sensitivity analysis; Spain; test retest reliability; urticaria; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Office Visits; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Psoriasis; Psychometrics; Qualitative Research; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Social Class; Spain; Statistics, Nonparametric",,,,,,,,,,"Eghlileb, A.M., Davies, E.E., Finlay, A.Y., Psoriasis has a major secondary impact on the lives of family members and partners (2007) Br J Dermatol, 156, pp. 1245-1250. , 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2007.07881.x, 17459044; Bhosle, M.J., Kulkarni, A., Feldman, S.R., Balkrishnan, R., Quality of life in patients with psoriasis (2006) Health Qual Life Outcomes, 4, p. 35. , 10.1186/1477-7525-4-35, 1501000, 16756666; de Korte, J., Sprangers, M.A., Mombers, F.M., Bos, J.D., Quality of life in patients with psoriasis: a systematic literature review (2004) J Investig Dermatol Symp Proc, 9, pp. 140-147. , 10.1046/j.1087-0024.2003.09110.x, 15083781; Müller, H., Brockow, T., Franke, A., Resch, F.L., Calliess, I.T., Schmid-Ott, G., Construct validity of the questionnaire on experience with skin complaints (short form).

Clinical evaluation of skin lesions is based on common sense and experience of the dermatologist to differentiate features of each disease. Aim: To evaluate a computer-based image analysis system as a helping tool for classification of commonly encountered diseases. Materials and Methods: The study included 50 selected images from each of psoriasis, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, pityrasis rosea, and pitryasis rubra pilaris with a total of 300 images. The study comprised three main processes peformed on the 300 included images: segmentation, feature extraction followed by classification. Results: Rough sets recorded the highest percentage of accuracy and sensitivity of segmentation for the six groups of diseases compared with the other three used techniques (topological derivative, K-means clustering, and watershed). Rule-based classifier using the concept of rough sets recorded the best percentage of classification (96.7%) for the six groups of diseases compared with the other six techniques of classification used: K-means clustering, fuzzy c-means clustering, classification and regression tree, rule-based classifier with discretization, and K-nearest neighbor technique. Conclusion: Rough sets approach proves its superiority for both the segmentation and the classification processes of papulo-squamous skin diseases compared with the other used segmentation and classification techniques. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Classification; Feature extraction; Papulo-Squamous skin diseases; ROC; Rough sets; Segmentation","Atopic dermatitis; Classification and regression tree; Classification process; Classification technique; Clinical evaluation; Clinical features; Close-in; Common sense; Discretizations; Fuzzy C means clustering; Image analysis systems; K-means clustering; K-nearest neighbors; Main process; Papulo-Squamous skin diseases; ROC; Rough set; Rule-based classifier; Skin disease; Skin lesion; Topological derivatives; Classification (of information); Computer aided analysis; Dermatitis; Dermatology; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Rough set theory; Image segmentation; article; atopic dermatitis; clinical feature; disease classification; erythematosquamous skin disease; human; image analysis; lichen planus; pityriasis rosea; pityriasis rubra pilaris; psoriasis; seborrheic dermatitis; Dermoscopy; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photography; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Skin Diseases, Papulosquamous",,,,,,,,,,"Griffiths, C.E.M., Camp, R.D.R., Barker, J.N.W.N., Psoriasis (2004) Rook's textbook of dermatology.

Objective: We investigated the respiratory and allergic phenotypes of children followed in the Pollution and Asthma Risk: An Infant Study (PARIS) birth cohort. Methods: Information on respiratory and allergic disorders, medical visits, and medications was collected during medical examinations of children at 18 months of age; biomarker data were also collected (total and allergen-specific IgE levels and eosinophilia). Phenotypes were determined by using latent class analysis. Associated risk factors were determined based on answers to questionnaires about environmental exposures. Results: Apart from a reference group, which had a low prevalence of respiratory symptoms or allergies (n = 1271 [69.4%]), 3 phenotypes were identified. On the basis of clinical signs of severity and use of health care resources, we identified a mild phenotype (n = 306 [16.7%]) characterized by occasional mild wheeze and 2 severe phenotypes separated by atopic status. The atopic severe phenotype (n = 59 [3.2%]) included 49 (83%) children with wheezing and was characterized by a high prevalence of atopy (61% with allergenic sensitization) and atopic dermatitis (78%). In contrast, atopy was rare among children with the nonatopic severe phenotype (n = 195 [11%]); this group included 88% of the children with recurrent wheezing. Risk factors for respiratory disease included parental history of asthma, male sex, siblings, day care attendance, exposure to tobacco smoke or molds, indoor renovations, and being overweight, although these factors did not have similar affects on risk for all phenotypes. Conclusion: Atopy should be taken into account when assessing the risk of severe exacerbations (that require hospital-based care) in wheezing infants; precautions should be taken against respiratory irritants and molds and to prevent children from becoming overweight. © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","Atopy; cluster analysis; infancy; phenotype; risk factors; severity; wheeze","food allergen; immunoglobulin E; tobacco smoke; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; childhood obesity; clinical feature; cohort analysis; coughing; disease exacerbation; disease severity; eczema; environmental exposure; eosinophilia; family history; female; hospital care; human; infant; major clinical study; male; phenotype; population research; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; respiratory tract disease; risk factor; sex difference; sibling; wheezing",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,,"Pearce, N., Ait-Khaled, N., Beasley, R., Mallol, J., Keil, U., Mitchell, E., Worldwide trends in the prevalence of asthma symptoms: Phase III of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) (2007) Thorax, 62, pp. 758-766; Bousquet, J., Anto, J., Auffray, C., Akdis, M., Cambon-Thomsen, A., Keil, T., MeDALL (Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy): An integrated approach from phenotypes to systems medicine (2011) Allergy, 66, pp. 596-604; Stein, R.T., Holberg, C.J., Morgan, W.J., Wright, A.L., Lombardi, E., Taussig, L., Peak flow variability, methacholine responsiveness and atopy as markers for detecting different wheezing phenotypes in childhood (1997) Thorax, 52, pp. 946-952; Castro-Rodriguez, J.A., Holberg, C.J., Wright, A.L., Martinez, F.D., A clinical index to define risk of asthma in young children with recurrent wheezing (2000) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 162, pp. 1403-1406; Castro-Rodriguez, J.A., The Asthma Predictive Index: A very useful tool for predicting asthma in young children (2010) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 126, pp. 212-216; Brand, P.L., Baraldi, E., Bisgaard, H., Boner, A.L., Castro-Rodriguez, J.A., Custovic, A., Definition, assessment and treatment of wheezing disorders in preschool children: An evidence-based approach (2008) Eur Respir J, 32, pp. 1096-1110; (2009) Global Initiative for Asthma Report.

Epidemiologic studies point to a decreased frequency of allergy in patients with autoimmune diseases. However, recent studies suggest that IL-17 and related cytokines, which play a central role in autoimmunity, might also promote allergy. Objective: To address this controversy, we systematically studied the interactions between TH17-related cytokines and the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)-mediated proallergic pathway. Methods: We used human primary dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and skin explants. A novel geometric representation and multivariate ANOVA were used to analyze the TH cytokine profile. Results: We show that IL-17A specifically inhibits TSLP production but increases proinflammatory IL-8 production in human skin explants exposed to TNF-α and IL-4. This inhibitory activity was confirmed in cultured skin explants of atopic dermatitis lesions. At the T-cell level, TH17-polarizing cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TGF-β, and IL-23) inhibited TH2 differentiation induced by TSLP-activated DCs. This led to a global dominance of a TH17- polarizing environment over TSLP-activated DCs, as revealed by clustering and computational analysis. Conclusions: Our data indicate that T H17-related cytokines are negative regulators of the TSLP immune pathway. This might explain the decreased frequency of allergy in patients with autoimmunity and suggests new means of manipulating proallergic responses. © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology.","allergy; autoimmunity; dendritic cells; T cells; Thymic stromal lymphopoietin","cytokine; interleukin 17; interleukin 17F; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 23; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; macrophage derived chemokine; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor alpha; article; atopic dermatitis; autoimmunity; cell activation; cell differentiation; dendritic cell; epithelium; human; human cell; human tissue; priority journal; protein expression; T lymphocyte; Th17 cell; Th2 cell",,"interleukin 8, 114308-91-7",,,,,,,,"Soumelis, V., Reche, P.A., Kanzler, H., Yuan, W., Edward, G., Homey, B., Gilliet, M., Liu, Y.-J., Human epithelial cells trigger dendritic cell-mediated allergic inflammation by producing TSLP (2002) Nature Immunology, 3 (7), pp. 673-680. , DOI 10.1038/ni805; Ito, T., Wang, Y.-H., Duramad, O., Hori, T., Delespesse, G.J., Watanabe, N., Qin, F.X.-F., Liu, Y.-J., TSLP-activated dendritic cells induce an inflammatory T helper type 2 cell response through OX40 ligand (2005) Journal of Experimental Medicine, 202 (9), pp. 1213-1223. , http://www.jem.org/cgi/reprint/202/9/1213, DOI 10.1084/jem.20051135; Gilliet, M., Soumelis, V., Watanabe, N., Hanabuchi, S., Antonenko, S., De Waal-Malefyt, R., Liu, Y.-J., Human dendritic cells activated by TSLP and CD40L induce proallergic cytotoxic T cells (2003) Journal of Experimental Medicine, 197 (8), pp. 1059-1063. , DOI 10.1084/jem.20030240; Zhou, B., Comeau, M.R., De Smedt, T., Liggitt, H.D., Dahl, M.E., Lewis, D.B., Gyarmati, D., Ziegler, S.F., Thymic stromal lymphopoietin as a key initiator of allergic airway inflammation in mice (2005) Nature Immunology, 6 (10), pp. 1047-1053. , DOI 10.1038/ni1247, PII N1247; Tesmer, L.A., Lundy, S.K., Sarkar, S., Fox, D.A., Th17 cells in human disease (2008) Immunological Reviews, 223 (1), pp. 87-113. , DOI 10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00628.x; Henseler, T., Christophers, E., Disease concomitance in psoriasis (1995) J Am Acad Dermatol, 32, pp. 982-986; Rudwaleit, M., Andermann, B., Alten, R., Sorensen, H., Listing, J., Zink, A., Sieper, J., Braun, J., Atopic disorders in ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis (2002) Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, 61 (11), pp. 968-974. , DOI 10.1136/ard.61.11.968; Tremlett, H.L., Evans, J., Wiles, C.M., Luscombe, D.K., Asthma and multiple sclerosis: An inverse association in a case-control general practice population (2002) QJM - Monthly Journal of the Association of Physicians, 95 (11), pp. 753-756; Rabin, R.L., Levinson, A.I., The nexus between atopic disease and autoimmunity: A review of the epidemiological and mechanistic literature (2008) Clinical and Experimental Immunology, 153 (1), pp. 19-30. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03679.x; Decreased prevalence of atopic diseases in children with diabetes (2000) J Pediatr, 137, pp. 470-474. , Group T.E.S.S; Sheikh, A., Smeeth, L., Hubbard, R., There is no evidence of an inverse relationship between T H2-mediated atopy and TH1-mediated autoimmune disorders: Lack of support for the hygiene hypothesis (2003) Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 111 (1), pp. 131-135. , DOI 10.1067/mai.2003.8; Caffarelli, C., Cavagni, G., Pierdomenico, R., Chiari, G., Spattini, A., Vanelli, M., Coexistence of IgE-mediated allergy and type 1 diabetes in childhood (2004) International Archives of Allergy and Immunology, 134 (4), pp. 288-294. , DOI 10.1159/000079166; Stromberg, L.G., Ludvigsson, G.J., Bjorksten, B., Atopic allergy and delayed hypersensitivity in children with diabetes (1995) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 96, pp. 188-192; Ponsonby, A.-L., Dwyer, T., Van Der Mei, I., Kemp, A., Blizzard, L., Taylor, B., Kilpatrick, T., Simmons, R., Asthma onset prior to multiple sclerosis and the contribution of sibling exposure in early life (2006) Clinical and Experimental Immunology, 146 (3), pp. 463-470. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03235.x; Bogiatzi, S.I., Fernandez, I., Bichet, J.-C., Marloie-Provost, M.-A., Volpe, E., Sastre, X., Soumelis, V., Cutting edge: Proinflammatory and Th2 cytokines synergize to induce thymic stromal lymphopoietin production by human skin keratinocytes (2007) Journal of Immunology, 178 (6), pp. 3373-3377; Volpe, E., Servant, N., Zollinger, R., Bogiatzi, S.I., Hupe, P., Barillot, E., Soumelis, V., A critical function for transforming growth factor-β, interleukin 23 and proinflammatory cytokines in driving and modulating human TH-17 responses (2008) Nature Immunology, 9 (6), pp. 650-657. , DOI 10.1038/ni.1613, PII NI.1613; Chambers, J.M., Cleveland, W.S., Kleiner, B., Tukey, P.A., (1983) Graphical Methods for Data Analysis.

Objective: To identify phenotypes of severe recurrent wheezing and therapeutic approaches. Methods: We performed cluster analysis with 20 variables of 551 children with active asthma, younger than 36 months old, and enrolled in the Trousseau Asthma Program. Results: We identified 3 independent clusters of children with wheezing. Cluster 1, mild episodic viral wheeze (n = 327), consisted of children with wheezing related only to colds (71%), mild disease (76%), and mainly normal chest x-ray results. Cluster 2, nonatopic uncontrolled wheeze (n = 157), was characterized by moderate to severe disease (91%), uncontrolled wheezing despite high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (55%), parents with asthma, and increased levels of ferritine. Cluster 3, atopic multiple-trigger wheeze (n = 67), included more children with multiple-trigger wheeze (68%) than did clusters 1 or 2; eczema (75%); a positive result from the Phadiatop Infant test (90%); increased levels of IgE, IgA, and IgG; and abnormal results from chest x-rays. In separate analysis, 1 parameter for boys (increased total level of IgE) and 2 parameters for girls (wheezing severity and increased total level of IgE) properly classified 90% of boys and 83% of girls in the appropriate cluster. Significant associations were found between overcrowding, molds and cockroaches at home, and atopic multiple-trigger wheeze and between day-care attendance and nonatopic uncontrolled wheeze in other parts. Conclusion: We identified different phenotypes of recurrent wheezing in young children by using cluster analysis with usual variables. These phenotypes require confirmation in longer, follow-up studies. © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","allergy; ICS; preschool children; Risk factors","alpha 1 antitrypsin; ferritin; fluticasone; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin G; abnormal laboratory result; allergic rhinitis; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; classification; cluster analysis; cockroach; common cold; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; disease severity; drug megadose; female; follow up; food allergy; groups by age; home environment; human; immunoassay; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; mould; neutrophil; parent; patient compliance; Phadiatop Infant test; phenotype; preschool child; priority journal; random forest; recurrent disease; risk factor; sex difference; thorax radiography; treatment outcome; virus infection; wheezing",,"alpha 1 antitrypsin, 9041-92-3; ferritin, 9007-73-2; fluticasone, 90566-53-3; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9",,,,,,,,"Illi, S., Von Mutius, E., Lau, S., Niggemann, B., Gruber, C., Wahn, U., Perennial allergen sensitisation early in life and chronic asthma in children: A birth cohort study (2006) Lancet, 368 (9537), pp. 763-770. , DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69286-6, PII S0140673606692866; Martinez, F.D., Wright, A.L., Taussig, L.M., Holberg, C.J., Halonen, M., Morgan, W.J., Asthma and wheezing in the first six years of life.

For the development of anti-itch medications, there is a need for objective measures of scratching. Wrist actigraphy (monitoring wrist and hand movements with micro-accelerometers) is a promising method for assessing scratching; however, currently available technology has a limited capacity to discriminate scratching from other similar movements. In this study, we investigated methods to improve the specificity of actigraphy for scratch detection on movement data collected from subjects using the PAM-RL actigraph. A k-means cluster analysis was used to differentiate scratching from walking and restless sleep, which are potential confounds for nighttime scratching. Features used in the analysis include variance, peak frequency, autocorrelation value at one lag, and number of counts above 0.01 g's. The k-means cluster analysis exhibited a high sensitivity (0.900.10) and specificity for walking (0.980.05) and restless sleep (0.880.06), respectively, demonstrating the separability of these activities. This work indicates that the features described here can be used to develop a classifier that discriminates scratch from other activities. The described method of scratch detection shows promise as an objective method for assessing scratching movements in clinical trials and longitudinal studies of scratch. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Actigraph; Actigraphy; Atopic dermatitis; Auto-correlation value; Clinical trial; Hand movement; High sensitivity; K-means cluster analysis; Limited capacity; Longitudinal study; Micro-accelerometers; Objective measure; Objective methods; Peak frequencies; Scratch detection; Accelerometers; Cluster analysis; Dermatitis; Walking aids; Patient monitoring; article; cluster analysis; human; motor activity; pathophysiology; pruritus; wrist; Cluster Analysis; Humans; Motor Activity; Pruritus; Wrist",,,,,,,,,,"Camfferman, D., Kennedy, J.D., Gold, M., Martin, A.J., Lushington, K., Eczema and sleep and its relationship to daytime functioning in children Sleep Med Rev, 14, pp. 359-369; Daud, L.R., Garralda, M.E., David, T.J., Psychosocial adjustment in preschool children with atopic eczema (1993) Arch Dis Child, 69, pp. 670-676; Hon, K.L., Lam, M.C., Leung, T.F., Chow, C.M., Wong, E., Leung, A.K., Assessing itch in children with atopic dermatitis treated with tacrolimus: Objective versus subjective assessment (2007) Adv Ther, 24, pp. 23-28; Thorburn, P.T., Riha, R.L., Skin disorders and sleep in adults: Where is the evidence?

Therefore, the skin microbiota of patients with AD is believed to be different from that of healthy individuals. In the present study, the skin fungal microbiota of nine patients with mild, moderate, or severe AD and ten healthy subjects were compared using an rRNA clone library. Fungal D1/D2 large subunit analysis of 3647 clones identified 58 species and seven unknown phylotypes in face scale samples from patients with AD and healthy subjects. Malassezia species were predominant, accounting for 63%-86% of the clones identified from each subject. Overall, the non-Malassezia yeast microbiota of the patients was more diverse than that of the healthy individuals. In the AD samples 13.0 ± 3.0 species per case were detected, as compared to 8.0 ± 1.9 species per case in the samples taken from healthy individuals. Notably, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus diffluens, and Cryptococcus liquefaciens were detected in the samples from the patients with AD. Of the filamentous fungal microbiota, Cladosporium spp. and Toxicocladosporium irritans were the predominant species in these patients. Many pathogenic fungi, including Meyerozyma guilliermondii (anamorphic name, Candida guilliermondii), and Trichosporon asahii, and allergenic microorganisms such as Alternaria alternata and Aureobasidium pullulans were found on the skin of the healthy subjects. When the fungal microbiota of the samples from patients with mild/moderate to severe AD and healthy individuals were clustered together by principal coordinates analysis they were found to be clustered according to health status. © 2011 The Societies and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Atopic dermatitis; Microbiota; RRNA; Skin","ribosome RNA; adult; Alternaria alternata; article; atopic dermatitis; Aureobasidium pullulans; Candida albicans; clinical article; clone; cluster analysis; controlled study; Cryptococcus diffluens; Cryptococcus liquefaciens; disease severity; female; fungus; fungus identification; health status; human; human tissue; Malassezia; male; Meyerozyma guilliermondii; molecular library; nonhuman; skin flora; Toxicocladosporium irritans; Trichosporon asahii; Adult; Biodiversity; Dermatitis, Atopic; DNA, Fungal; DNA, Ribosomal; Female; Fungi; Genes, rRNA; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; RNA, Fungal; RNA, Ribosomal; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Skin; Alternaria alternata; Aureobasidium pullulans; Bacteria (microorganisms); Candida albicans; Cladosporium; Cryptococcus diffluens; Cryptococcus liquefaciens; Fungi; Malassezia; Pichia guilliermondii; Trichosporon asahii",,"DNA, Fungal; DNA, Ribosomal; RNA, Fungal; RNA, Ribosomal; RNA, ribosomal, 26S",,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 22590150",,,,,"Baker, B.S., The role of microorganisms in atopic dermatitis (2006) Clin Exp Immunol, 144, pp. 1-9; Svejgaard, E., Larsen, P., Deleuran, M., Ternowitz, T., Roed-Petersen, J., Nilsson, J., Treatment of head and neck dermatitis comparing itraconazole 200 mg and 400 mg daily for 1 week with placebo (2004) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 18, pp. 445-449; Nikkels, A.F., Piérard, G.E., Framing the future of antifungals in atopic dermatitis (2003) Dermatology, 206, pp. 398-400; Sugita, T., Suto, H., Unno, T., Tsuboi, R., Ogawa, H., Shinoda, T., Nishikawa, A., Molecular analysis of Malassezia microflora on the skin of atopic dermatitis patients and healthy subjects (2001) J Clin Microbiol, 39, pp. 3486-3490; Sugita, T., Tajima, M., Tsubuku, H., Tsuboi, R., Nishikawa, A., Quantitative analysis of cutaneous Malassezia in atopic dermatitis patients using real-time PCR (2006) Microbiol Immunol, 50, pp. 549-552; Takahata, Y., Sugita, T., Kato, H., Nishikawa, A., Hiruma, M., Muto, M., Cutaneous Malassezia flora in atopic dermatitis differs between adults and children (2007) Br J Dermatol., 157, pp. 1178-1182; Kato, H., Sugita, T., Ishibashi, Y., Nishikawa, A., Detection and quantification of specific IgE antibodies against eight Malassezia species in sera of patients with atopic dermatitis by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (2006) Microbiol Immunol, 50, pp. 851-856; Kurtzman, C.P., Robnett, C.J., Identification of clinically important ascomycetous yeasts based on nucleotide divergence in the 5' end of the large-subunit (26S) ribosomal DNA gene (1997) J Clin Microbiol, 35, pp. 1216-1223; Lozupone, C., Knight, R., UniFrac: a new phylogenetic method for comparing microbial communities (2005) Appl Environ Microbiol, 71, pp. 8228-8235; Lozupone, C., Hamady, M., Knight, R., UniFrac-an online tool for comparing microbial community diversity in a phylogenetic context.

Factor analysis was applied to the whole questionnaire. The correlation of S with QoL1 and QoL2 scores was evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation tests. Owner sex, age, educational level and willingness to pay for a potential definitive cure of the disease were recorded, and compared with quality of life (QoL) scores. In 23 atopic dogs, CADESI-03, pruritus Visual Analogue Scale and QoL scores were obtained before and after therapy, and their correlation was evaluated with linear regression. Factor analysis revealed that three factors (S, QoL1 and QoL2) explained 75% of the variance. Owner-perceived severity correlated significantly with QoL1 and QoL2 (P=0.002 and P=0.015, respectively). The five diseases with the worst QoL scores were scabies, pododermatitis, complicated atopic dermatitis, pemphigus foliaceus and endocrine alopecia. Pruritic diseases did not give significantly higher QoL1 or QoL2 scores compared with nonpruritic diseases (P=0.19, Kruskall-Wallis test). Owner sex, age or educational level did not influence QoL scores. Female sex, a younger age and a higher educational level were significantly associated with more willingness to pay. In atopic dogs, all the scores decreased after therapy, but post-treatment CADESI-03 and Visual Analogue Scale scores did not correlate with QoL1 and QoL2. Questions related to the burden of maintenance therapy showed the lowest improvements in score. © 2011 The Authors.

Although relatively little is understood about its underlying mechanisms due to its complexity, skin barrier dysfunction has been recognised as a key factor in the development of AD. Skin barrier homeostasis requires tight control of the activity of proteases, called kallikreins (KLKs), whose activity is regulated by a complex network of protein interactions that remains poorly understood despite its pathological importance. Characteristic symptoms of AD include the outbreak of inflammation triggered by external (eg. mechanical and chemical) stimulus and the persistence and aggravation of inflammation even if the initial stimulus disappears. These characteristic symptoms, together with some experimental data, suggest the presence of positive feedback regulation for KLK activity by inflammatory signals. We developed simple mathematical models for the KLK activation system to study the effects of feedback loops and carried out bifurcation analysis to investigate the model behaviours corresponding to inflammation caused by external stimulus. The model analysis confirmed that the hypothesised core model mechanisms capture the essence of inflammation outbreak by a defective skin barrier. Our models predicted the outbreaks of inflammation at weaker stimulus and its longer persistence in AD patients compared to healthy control. We also proposed a novel quantitative indicator for inflammation level by applying principal component analysis to microarray data. The model analysis reproduced qualitative AD characteristics revealed by this indicator. Our results strongly implicate the presence and importance of feedback mechanisms in KLK activity regulation. We further proposed future experiments that may provide informative data to enhance the system-level understanding on the regulatory mechanisms of skin barrier in AD and healthy individuals. © 2011 Tanaka et al.",,"kallikrein; proteinase activated receptor 2; article; atopic dermatitis; feedback system; inflammation; mathematical model; permeability barrier; prediction; principal component analysis; protein degradation; quantitative analysis; receptor upregulation; regulatory mechanism; skin permeability; stimulus response; biological model; case control study; DNA microarray; feedback system; genetics; human; kinetics; metabolism; pathophysiology; skin; Case-Control Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Feedback, Physiological; Humans; Kallikreins; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Skin",,"kallikrein, 8006-48-2, 9001-01-8; Kallikreins, 3.4.21.-",,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/G007446/1",,,,,"Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis (2010) Ann Dermatol, 22, pp. 125-137; Callard, R.E., Harper, J.I., The skin barrier, atopic dermatitis and allergy: a role for langerhans cells?

However, their role in allergic disease is unclear. Allergic diseases are immunologically heterogeneous, and we hypothesized that n-3 fatty acid composition in serum and breast milk may vary according to clinical manifestations. Further, animal studies have shown reduction of serum-PUFA levels during allergic inflammation. Objective To investigate fatty acid composition in breast milk and serum from women with different atopic disease manifestations. Secondly, to determine whether low PUFA levels reflected insufficient intakes. Methods Fatty acids were analysed in breast milk and serum of women with atopic eczema and respiratory allergy (n=16), only respiratory allergy (n=7), as well as healthy women (n=22). Dietary intake of foods expected to affect long-chain n-3 PUFA levels were estimated by food-frequency questionnaire. The fatty acid pattern was related to diagnostic group and intake of relevant food items using a multivariate pattern recognition method (partial least squares projections to latent structures and discriminant analysis). Results Women with a combination of eczema and respiratory allergy had lower breast milk levels of several PUFAs (arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA, docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, and docosapentaenoic acid, DPA), and a lower ratio of long-chain n-3 PUFAs/n-6 PUFAs. Their PUFA levels differed not only from that of healthy women, but also from that of women with only respiratory allergy. The latter had a fatty acid pattern similar to that of healthy women. Despite low EPA, DHA and DPA levels women with eczema and respiratory allergy consumed no less fish than did healthy women. Conclusion & Clinical Relevance Our data suggest that reduced levels of long-chain n-3 fatty acids in serum and breast milk characterize women with extensive allergic disease including eczema, and are not related to low fish intake. Consumption of PUFAs during the allergic process may explain these findings. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Allergy; Atopic eczema; Atopy; Breast milk; DHA; EPA; Fatty acids","arachidonic acid; docosahexaenoic acid;

The study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. Microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative PCR and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The core population of the Lactobacillus group was identified as Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus oris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium catenulatum. The fecal numbers of L. acidophilus and B. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. The levels of Bifidobacterium correlated positively (P=0.03), while the levels of the Lactobacillus group negatively (P=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index. This correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. The main conclusion of the study is that administration of L. acidophilus NCFM and B. lactis Bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces. © 2011 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Three different statistical analysis procedures, two of which involved principal component analysis (PCA), were performed on the Raman spectra in order to determine the FLG content.Results: The infants who had a lower FLG content, determined using any of the three statistical analysis procedures proposed, were also the ones that clinically developed AD.Conclusion: The results suggest that Raman spectroscopy and statistical analysis such as PCA could be used as an early detection procedure for FLG -related AD and as a possible quantitative marker for FLG gene mutations. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Atopic dermatitis; Filaggrin; Principal component analysis; Raman spectroscopy","Atopic dermatitis; Early detection; Filaggrin; Gene mutations; Predisposing factors; Principal Components; Raman spectra; Statistical analysis; Dermatitis; Genes; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Spectrum analysis; Principal component analysis; filaggrin; article; atopic dermatitis; clinical article; diagnostic value; disease marker; disease predisposition; early diagnosis; gene mutation; human; infant; newborn; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; Raman spectrometry; spectrometer; Dermatitis, Atopic; Early Diagnosis; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Intermediate Filament Proteins; Mutation; Phenotype; Predictive Value of Tests; Sensitivity and Specificity; Skin; Spectrum Analysis, Raman",,"Intermediate Filament Proteins; filaggrin","Raman Systems, Ocean Optics, Italy","Ocean Optics, Italy",,,,,,"Kezic, S., Kemperman, P.M.J.H., Koster, E.S., Loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene lead to reduced level of natural moisturizing factor in the stratum corneum (2008) J Invest Dermatol, 128, pp. 2117-2119; Nemoto-Hasebe, I., Akiyama, M., Nomura, T., Sandilands, A., McLean, W.H.I., Shimizu, H., Clinical severity correlates with impaired barrier in filaggrin-related eczema (2009) J Invest Dermatol, 129, pp. 682-689; Weidinger, S., Illig, T., Baurecht, H., Loss-of-function variations within the filaggrin gene predispose for atopic dermatitis with allergic sensitizations (2006) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 118, pp. 214-219; Jollifee, I.T., Principal component analysis (2002), 2nd edn.

Interventions aiming to improve parent management of this condition are promising. Unfortunately, evaluation is hampered by lack of precise research tools to measure change. Objectives: To develop a suite of valid and reliable research instruments to appraise parents' self-efficacy for performing atopic dermatitis management tasks; outcome expectations of performing management tasks; and self-reported task performance in a community sample of parents of children with atopic dermatitis. Methods: The Parents' Eczema Management Scale (PEMS) and the Parents' Outcome Expectations of Eczema Management Scale (POEEMS) were developed from an existing self-efficacy scale, the Parental Self-Efficacy with Eczema Care Index (PASECI). Each scale was presented in a single self-administered questionnaire, to measure self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and self-reported task performance related to managing child atopic dermatitis. Each was tested with a community sample of parents of children with atopic dermatitis, and psychometric evaluation of the scales' reliability and validity was conducted. Setting and participants: A community-based convenience sample of 120 parents of children with atopic dermatitis completed the self-administered questionnaire. Participants were recruited through schools across Australia. Results: Satisfactory internal consistency and test-retest reliability was demonstrated for all three scales. Construct validity was satisfactory, with positive relationships between self-efficacy for managing atopic dermatitis and general perceived self-efficacy; self-efficacy for managing atopic dermatitis and self-reported task performance; and self-efficacy for managing atopic dermatitis and outcome expectations. Factor analyses revealed two-factor structures for PEMS and PASECI alike, with both scales containing factors related to performing routine management tasks, and managing the child's symptoms and behaviour. Factor analysis was also applied to POEEMS resulting in a three-factor structure. Factors relating to independent management of atopic dermatitis by the parent, involving healthcare professionals in management, and involving the child in the management of atopic dermatitis were found. Parents' self-efficacy and outcome expectations had a significant influence on self-reported task performance. Conclusions: Findings suggest that PEMS and POEEMS are valid and reliable instruments worthy of further psychometric evaluation. Likewise, validity and reliability of PASECI was confirmed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Atopic; Chronic disease management; Dermatitis; Eczema; Outcome expectations; Parenting; Self-efficacy","adult; article; atopic dermatitis; child; human; psychometry; self concept; treatment outcome; validation study; Adult; Child; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Psychometrics; Self Efficacy; Treatment Outcome",,,,,,"Conflict of interest : None declared.

They induce acute respiratory failure, and sometimes death. Two immunological signals acting in synergy are necessary for inducing asthma exacerbations. The first, triggered by allergens and/or unknown agents leads to the chronic Th2 inflammation characteristic of asthma. The second, caused by either viral infection, allergens, pollutants or a combination of these, results in an acute Th1 and Th2 inflammation precipitating symptoms. In both, innate and adaptive immunities are involved, providing a series of potential targets for therapy. Molecules associated to the first, chronic inflammation constitute targets for preventing therapies, when these related to the second, acute signal provide the rationale for curative treatments. Toll like receptors and bronchial epithelial cell-derived cytokines, engaged upstream of inflammation constitute interesting candidates for future treatments. The great heterogeneity of asthma has to be taken into account when considering targets for therapy to identify clusters of responders and nonresponders, and an integrative system biology approach will be necessary to go further. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Allergen; Asthma; Exacerbation; Pollutant; Toll like receptors; Virus","allergen; antivirus agent; azithromycin; chemokine; chemokine receptor; corticosteroid; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E antibody; interleukin 25; interleukin 33; macrolide; mepolizumab; omalizumab; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; toll like receptor; airway remodeling; allergic asthma; antiviral therapy; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; bronchitis; cellular immunity; chronic inflammation; cluster analysis; corticosteroid therapy; cytokine production; cytokine response; dendritic cell; disease exacerbation; epithelium cell; forced expiratory volume; human; immunoglobulin production; immunopathogenesis; innate immunity; Loeffler pneumonia; natural killer cell; nomenclature; nonhuman; pollutant; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; Th1 cell; Th17 cell; Th2 cell; virus infection",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; mepolizumab, 196078-29-2; omalizumab, 242138-07-4; toll like receptor, 409141-78-2",,,,,,,,"Akbari, O., Faul, J.L., Hoyte, E.G., Berry, G.J., Wahlström, J., Kronenberg, M., CD4+ invariant T-cell-receptor+ natural killer T cells in bronchial asthma (2006) N Engl J Med, 354 (11), pp. 1117-1129; Akbari, O., Freeman, G.J., Meyer, E.H., Greenfield, E.A., Chang, T.T., Sharpe, A.H., Berry, G., Umetsu, D.T., Antigen-specific regulatory T cells develop via the ICOS-ICOS-ligand pathway and inhibit allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity (2002) Nature Medicine, 8 (9), pp. 1024-1032. , DOI 10.1038/nm745; Akbari, O., Stock, P., Meyer, E., Kronenberg, M., Sidobre, S., Nakayama, T., Taniguchi, M., Umetsu, D.T., Essential role of NKT cells producing IL-4 and IL-13 in the development of allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity (2003) Nature Medicine, 9 (5), pp. 582-588. , DOI 10.1038/nm851; Akdis, M., Verhagen, J., Taylor, A., Karamloo, F., Karagiannidis, C., Crameri, R., Thunberg, S., Akdis, C.A., Immune responses in healthy and allergic individuals are characterized by a fine balance between allergen-specific T regulatory 1 and T helper 2 cells (2004) Journal of Experimental Medicine, 199 (11), pp. 1567-1575. , DOI 10.1084/jem.20032058; Allakhverdi, Z., Comeau, M.R., Jessup, H.K., Yoon, B.-R.P., Brewer, A., Chartier, S., Paquette, N., Delespesse, G., Thymic stromal lymphopoietin is released by human epithelial cells in response to microbes, trauma, or inflammation and potently activates mast cells (2007) Journal of Experimental Medicine, 204 (2), pp. 253-258. , http://www.jem.org/cgi/reprint/204/2/253, DOI 10.1084/jem.20062211; Auffray, C., Adcock, I.M., Chung, K.F., Djukanovic, R., Pison, C., Sterk, P.J., An integrative systems biology approach to understanding pulmonary diseases (2010) Chest, 137 (6), pp. 1410-1416; Barends, M., Van Oosten, M., De Rond, C.G.H., Dormans, J.A.M.A., Osterhaus, A.D.M.E., Neijens, H.J., Kimman, T.G., Timing of infection and prior immunization with Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in RSV-enhanced allergic inflammation (2004) Journal of Infectious Diseases, 189 (10), pp. 1866-1872. , DOI 10.1086/386341; Barnes, P.J., Mechanisms and resistance in glucocorticoid control of inflammation (2010) J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol, 120 (23), pp. 76-85; Barrett, N.A., Austen, K.F., Innate cells and T helper 2 cell immunity in airway inflammation (2009) Immunity, 31 (3), pp. 425-437; Barrett, N.A., Maekawa, A., Rahman, O.M., Austen, K.F., Kanaoka, Y., Dectin-2 recognition of house dust mite triggers cysteinyl leukotriene generation by dendritic cells (2010) J Immunol, 182, pp. 1119-1128; Bartlett, N.W., Walton, R.P., Edwards, M.R., Aniscenko, J., Caramori, G., Zhu, J., Glanville, N., Johnston, S.L., Mouse models of rhinovirus-induced disease and exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation (2008) Nature Medicine, 14 (2), pp. 199-204. , DOI 10.1038/nm1713, PII NM1713; Baulig, A., Sourdeval, M., Meyer, M., Marano, F., Baeza-Squiban, A., Biological effects of atmospheric particles on human bronchial epithelial cells.

Design: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study taking place from July 15, 2005, through February 29, 2008. Setting: Academic pediatric dermatology practice. Patients: A total of 205 patients between the ages of 12 and 17 years with a skin condition. Main Outcome Measures: Participants completed the Skindex-Teen questionnaire, reported sociodemographic data, and answered clinical questions at enrollment. Four weeks later, they completed Skindex-Teen and responded to clinical questions again. Forty patients also completed Skindex-Teen 48 hours after baseline. Results: Of 205 patients, 200 (97.6%) completed all enrollment materials; 125 (62.5%) of these returned follow-up materials, of which 115 (57.5%) were complete. Twenty-three of 40 participants (57.5%) completed the 48-hour-after-initial-answers materials. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 15.3 (1.4) years (range, 12.9-18.0 years). Approximately half reported their skin condition as poor (26 [13.0%]) or fair (67 [33.5%]); most rated their general health as very good (62 [31.0%]) or excellent (80 [40.0%]). The dimensionality of the items was evaluated using factor analysis; results suggested 2 factors, termed physical symptoms (5 items) and psychosocial functioning (16 items). Both scales demonstrated excellent internal consistency. All item-scale reliabilities were greater than 0.4. Fit of items to the measurement model was supported by Rasch analysis. Test-retest reliability was supported by intraclass correlation coefficients (0.82-0.94) for total scores, physical symptoms, and psychosocial functioning scales. At 4 weeks, 16 (13.9%) reported worsening of their skin condition, 57 (19.6%) reported it had remained unchanged, and 42 (36.5%) reported improvement. Significant mean differences were present between the improved and worsened groups for the psychosocial functioning scale and total scores.

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus versus pimecrolimus in adults with AD. Methods: Using a Markov cohort model, the authors projected clinical and economic outcomes over six weeks in adults receiving tacrolimus versus pimecrolimus. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in terms of the ratio of the expected cost of AD-related care to the expected number of days with resolved AD. Results: Patients receiving tacrolimus had an estimated 4.9 fewer days with active AD over six weeks (30.0 versus 34.9 for pimecrolimus). Expected costs (per patient) of AD-related care also were lower for tacrolimus patients ($501.27 versus $546.14, respectively). Limitation: While pimecrolimus is indicated for use solely in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, the trial on which this study was based included some patients with severe AD. Conclusion: In adults with AD, tacrolimus 0.1% may yield better clinical outcomes and lower costs of care than pimecrolimus 1.0%.

Objectives The objective of this study was to develop a model to analyse the cost-effectiveness of a barrier-strengthening moisturizing cream as maintenance therapy compared with no treatment after initial treatment with betamethasone valerate in adult patients with AD in Sweden. A further aim was to apply a similar health-economic analysis for Denmark, Norway and Finland. Methods A Markov simulation model was developed including data from three sources: (i) efficacy data from a randomized controlled trial including patients with moderate AD treated with either a moisturizing cream or no treatment, (ii) resource utilization and quality of life data, and (iii) unit prices from official price lists. A societal perspective was used and the analysis was performed according to treatment practice in Sweden. The model simulation was also applied for Denmark, Norway and Finland with inclusion of country-specific unit costs. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results The results from the present analyses of treatment for patients with moderate AD indicate that maintenance treatment with a moisturizing cream during eczema-free periods could be cost-effective in a societal perspective. Similar results were obtained for Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. Conclusions According to the analysis, treatment with a moisturizing cream was found to be a cost-effective option compared with no treatment in eczema-free periods in adult patients with AD in the four Nordic countries. © 2009 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.","Atopic dermatitis; Cost-effectiveness; Model simulation; Moisturizer; Nordic countries","betamethasone valerate; canoderm; dermatological agent; unclassified drug; adult; aged; article; atopic dermatitis; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; cream; Denmark; Finland; health care utilization; human; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; mathematical model; Norway; priority journal; quality of life; sensitivity analysis; simulation; Sweden; Betamethasone 17-Valerate; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Denmark; Dermatitis, Atopic; Emollients; Finland; Glucocorticoids; Health Care Costs; Health Expenditures; Humans; Markov Chains; Models, Econometric; Norway; Primary Health Care; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sweden",,"betamethasone valerate, 2152-44-5, 57654-97-4; Betamethasone 17-Valerate, 2152-44-5; Emollients; Glucocorticoids",,,,,,,,"Halvarsson, K., Lodén, M., Increasing quality of life by imrpoving the quality of skin in patients with atopic dermatitis (2007) Int J Cosmet Sci, 29, pp. 69-83; Bingefors, K., Lindberg, M., Isacson, D., Self-reported dermatological problems and use of prescribed topical drugs correlate with decreased quality of life: An epidemiological survey (2002) Br J Dermatol, 147, pp. 285-290; Lundberg, L., Johannesson, M., Silverdahl, M., Quality of life, health-state utilities and willingness to pay in patients with psoriasis and atopic eczema (1999) Br J Dermatol, 141, pp. 1067-1075; Isacson, D., Bingefors, K., Lindberg, M., Self-reported dermatological problems and preferences for health: An epidemiological survey (2004) Acta Derm Venereol, 84, pp. 27-31; Lundberg, L., Johannesson, M., Silverdahl, M., Health-related quality of life in patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis measured with SF-36, DLQI and subjective measure of disease activity (2000) Acta Derm Venereol, 80, pp. 430-434; Schmitt, J., Meurer, M., Klon, M., Assessment of health state utilities of controlled and uncontrolled psoriasis and atopic eczema: A population-based study (2007) Br J Dermatol, 158, pp. 351-359; Abramovits, W., Boguniewicz, M., Paller, A.S., Whitaker-Worth, D.L., Prendergast, M.M., Tokar, M., Tong, K.B., The economics of topical immunomodulators for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (2005) PharmacoEconomics, 23 (6), pp. 543-566. , http://saturn.bids.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ds_deliver/1/u/d/ISIS/19808983.1/adis/ pec/2005/00000023/00000006/art00003/D714807354DCA5101121168388DF101F11BBE750B1. pdf?link=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/error/delivery&format=pdf, DOI 10.2165/00019053-200523060-00003; Ellis, C.N., Drake, L.A., Prendergast, M.M., Cost-effectiveness analysis of tacrolimus ointment versus high-potency topical corticosteroids in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (2003) J Am Acad Dermatol, 48, pp. 553-563; Lamb, S.R., Rademaker, M., Pharmacoeconomics of drug therapy for atopic dermatitis (2002) Exper Opin Pharmacother, 3, pp. 249-555; Hoare, C., Liwan, P.A., Williams, H., Systematic review of treatments for atopic eczema (2000) Health Technol Assess, 4, pp. 1-191; Elias, P., Wood, L., Feingold, K., Epidermal pathogenesis of inflammatory dermatoses (1999) Am J Contact Dermat, 10, pp. 119-126; Lucky, A., Leach, A., Laskarzewski, P., Use of an emollient as a steroid-sparing agent in the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in children (1997) Pediatr Dermatol, 14, pp. 321-324; Wiren, K., Nohlgard, C., Nyberg, F., Treatment with a barrier-strengthening moisturizing cream delays relapse of atopic dermatitis: A prospective and randomized controlled clinical trial (2009) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, , doi:; (2008) FASS 2008 (Pharmaceutical Specialties in Sweden)., , FASS.

These genes are possible candidates for disease-specific pathogenetic changes, but could also provide a tool for molecular diagnostics of inflammatory skin conditions in general. Objectives To analyse if gene expression signatures as found in purified epidermal cells from AD are also present in other eczematous conditions such as allergic and irritant contact dermatitis. Methods We used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics to investigate gene expression in different forms of eczema. Normal epidermis and psoriatic epidermis were analysed for comparison. Results Carbonic anhydrase II was highly induced in epidermis from all forms of eczema but not in psoriasis. Remarkably, the presumed neuron-specific Nel-like protein 2 showed a strong induction only in AD epidermis. Interleukin-1F9, elafin, β-defensin-2 and vanin-3 were strongly induced in psoriasis, but not in any type of eczema. High levels of the chemokines CCL17 and CXCL10 were predominantly found in epidermis of allergic contact dermatitis. The chemokine CXCL8 was highly expressed in psoriasis, AD and allergic contact dermatitis, but not in irritant contact dermatitis. Cluster analysis or multinomial logistic regression indicated that expression levels of a set of seven genes are a strong predictor of the type of inflammatory response. Conclusions These observations contribute to molecular diagnostic criteria for inflammatory skin conditions. © 2009 British Association of Dermatologists.","Atopic dermatitis; Contact dermatitis; Cytokines;

The aim of this study is to identify the Malassezia species obtained from pityriasis versicolor patients, using morphological, biochemical, physiological as well as Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. Materials and Methods: The identification of Malassezia species is performed according to microscopic features and physiological characteristics, including catalase reaction and Tween assimilation tests. The DNA is extracted from cultured Malassezia using the glass bead, phenol-chloroform method. The internal transcribed spacer 1(ITS1) region is amplified and there is restricted digestion of the PCR products with two enzymes Cfo I and Bst F5I. Results : The most commonly isolated species is M. globosa (47.6%). RFLP analysis of the PCR products of the ITS1 region is in complete agreement with those from the DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 region and the biochemical tests. Conclusion : Based on the findings of this study, it can be concluded that PCR-RFLP is a relatively simple and quick method, completely comparable to the routine methods used for Malassezia identification.","Identification; Malassezia; Pityriasis versicolor; Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism","internal transcribed spacer 1; adolescent; adult; animal cell; article; bacterium identification; chemical analysis; child; controlled study; DNA sequence; female; human; infant; Iran; major clinical study; Malassezia; Malassezia globosa; male; morphological trait; nonhuman; pathogenesis; polymerase chain reaction; preschool child; prevalence; restriction fragment length polymorphism; school child; tinea versicolor; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animals; Catalase; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; DNA, Fungal; Female; Genotype; Humans; Infant; Iran; Malassezia; Male; Middle Aged; Mycological Typing Techniques; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Polysorbates; Ribotyping; Tinea Versicolor; Young Adult",,"Catalase, 1.11.1.6; DNA, Fungal; Polysorbates",,,,,,,,"Sugita, T., Tajima, M., Takashima, M., Amaya, M., Saito, M., Tsuboi, R., A new yeast, Malassezia yamatoensis, isolated from a patient with seborrheic dermatitis, and its distribution in patients and healthy subjects (2004) Microbiol Immunol, 48, pp. 579-583; Guillot, J., Gueho, E., Lesourd, M., Midgley, G., Chevrier, G., Dupont, B., Identification of Malassezia yeasts: A practical approach (1996) J Mycol Med, 6, pp. 103-110; Mirhendi, H., Makimura, K., Zomorodian, K., Yamada, T., Sugita, T., Yamaguchi, H., A simple PCR-RFLP method for identification and differentiation of 11 Malassezia species (2004) Microbiol Meth, 61, pp. 281-284; Gupta, A.K., Kohli, Y., Faergemann, J., Summerbell, R.C., Epidemiology of Malassezia yeasts associated with pityriasis versicolor in Ontario, Canada (2001) Med Mycol, 39, pp. 199-206; Yamada, Y., Makimura, K., Mirhendi, H., Ueda, K., Nishiyama, Y., Yamaguchi, H., Comparison of different methods for extraction of mitochondrial DNA from human pathogenic yeasts (2002) Jpn J Infect Dis, 55, pp. 122-125; Makimura, K., Tamura, Y., Kudo, M., Uchida, K., Saito, H., Yamaguchi, H., Species identification and strain typing of Malassezia species stock strains and clinical isolates based on the DNA sequences of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 regions (2000) J Med Microbiol, 49, pp. 29-35; Crespo, E.V., Ojeda, M.A., Vera, C.A., Crespo, E.A., Sanchez, F.F., Malassezia globosa as the causative agent of pityriasis versicolor (2000) Br J Dermatol, 143, pp. 799-803; Trazooie, B., Kordbacheh, P., Zaini, F., Zomorodian, K., Saadat, F., Zeraati, H., Study of the distribution of Malassezia species in patients with pityriasis versicolor and healthy individuals in Tehran, Iran (2004) BMC Dermatol, 4, p. 5. , http://www.biomedcenteral.com/1471-5945/4/5, Available from: [last accessed on 2008 Dec 20]; Nakabayashi, A., Sei, Y., Guillot, J., Identification of Malassezia species isolated from patients with seborrhoeic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, pityriasis versicolor and normal subjects (2000) Med Mycol, 38, pp. 337-341; Gaitanis, G., Velegraki, A., Alexopoulos, E.C., Chaspai, V., Tsigonia, A., Katsahbas, A., Distribution of Malassezia species in pityriasis versicolor and seborrhoeic dermatitis in Greece.

In order to dissect the genetic background several linkage and genetic association studies have been performed. Yet very little is known about specific genes involved in this complex skin disease, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Methodology/Findings: We used human DNA microarrays to identify a molecular picture of the programmed responses of the human genome to AE. The transcriptional program was analyzed in skin biopsy samples from lesional and patch-tested skin from AE patients sensitized to Malassezia sympodialis (M. sympodialis), and corresponding biopsies from healthy individuals. The most notable feature of the global gene-expression pattern observed in AE skin was a reciprocal expression of induced inflammatory genes and repressed lipid metabolism genes. The overall transcriptional response in M. sympodialis patch-tested AE skin was similar to the gene-expression signature identified in lesional AE skin. In the constellation of genes differentially expressed in AE skin compared to healthy control skin, we have identified several potential susceptibility genes that may play a critical role in the pathological condition of AE. Many of these genes, including genes with a role in immune responses, lipid homeostasis, and epidermal differentiation, are localized on chromosomal regions previously linked to AE. Conclusions/Significance: Through genome-wide expression profiling, we were able to discover a distinct reciprocal expression pattern of induced inflammatory genes and repressed lipid metabolism genes in skin from AE patients. We found a significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes in AE with cytobands associated to the disease, and furthermore new chromosomal regions were found that could potentially guide future region-specific linkage mapping in AE.

This paper introduces an unsupervised color segmentation procedure applied to one disease of this group named Atopic Dermatitis. Evaluation of different color models is done to select the most appropriate model for representing skin lesions. Two steps of color segmentation were done to detect skin lesions with less computation. First is coarse segmentation with optimal threshold of the CIE color model, and second is fine segmentation with K-means clustering technique. Results of the proposed algorithm prove its success as the manual segmentation with expertise. © 2008 IEEE.","Color models; Image segmentation; K-means clustering; Optimal threshold; Skin lesions","Appropriate models; Atopic dermatitis; Clinical features; Coarse segmentations; Color models; Color segmentations; Differential diagnosis; K-means clustering; K-means clustering techniques; Manual segmentations; Optimal threshold; Real problems; Skin lesions; Biomedical engineering; Dermatitis; Diagnosis; Digital image storage; Image segmentation; Optimization; Skin; Water supply systems; Color",,,,,,,,,,"Stewart, W.D., Danto, J.L., Maddin, S., (1978) Dermatology diagnosis and treatment of Cutaneous disorders, , Fourth Edition, The C.V.

This paradigm has recently been challenged by the finding that mutations and polymorphisms in epithelium-expressed genes involved in physical barrier function or innate immunity, are risk factors of these conditions. We used a functional genomics approach to analyze cultured keratinocytes from patients with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis and healthy controls. First passage primary cells derived from non-lesional skin were stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of a panel of 55 genes associated with epidermal differentiation and cutaneous inflammation was measured by quantitative PCR. A subset of these genes was analyzed at the protein level. Using cluster analysis and multivariate analysis of variance we identified groups of genes that were differentially expressed, and could, depending on the stimulus, provide a disease-specific gene expression signature. We found particularly large differences in expression levels of innate immunity genes between keratinocytes from psoriasis patients and atopic dermatitis patients. Our findings indicate that cell autonomous differences exist between cultured keratinocytes of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients, which we interpret to be genetically determined. We hypothesize that polymorphisms of innate immunity genes both with signaling and effector functions are coadapted, each with balancing advantages and disadvantages. In the case of psoriasis, high expression levels of antimicrobial proteins genes putatively confer increased protection against microbial infection, but the biological cost could be a beneficial system gone awry, leading to overt inflammatory disease. © 2008 Zeeuwen et al.",,"gamma interferon inducible protein 10;

Two hundred and eighty-four participants who had a GP or dermatologist confirmed diagnosis of AD completed the IPQ-R. The factor structure of the IPQ-R was examined using confirmatory (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The results of the CFA did not indicate a good comparative fit with the IPQ-R subscales, while the EFA and a fixed six-factor principal components analysis largely replicated the original factor structure of the IPQ-R. The existence of the acute/chronic and cyclical timeline dimensions, and the illness coherence subscale was most strongly supported, while all items of the consequences and emotional representation subscales consistently loaded onto one factor. The EFA for causal attributions did not produce a stable solution. The findings indicate that although the factor structure of the IPQ-R was not confirmed in the sample of patients with AD using CFA, it was partly reproduced using EFA. Overall, the results suggest that in patients with AD the IPQ-R, in particular the consequences and emotional representations subscales, should be employed and interpreted with care. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Atopic dermatitis; Illness perceptions; Psychometric properties; Representations","adult; aged; analytic method; article; atopic dermatitis; controlled study; factorial analysis; female; general practitioner; human; major clinical study; male; principal component analysis; priority journal; psychometry; questionnaire; revised illness perception questionnaire; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Dermatitis, Atopic; Emotions; England; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Personality Inventory; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Sick Role",,,,,,,,,,"Bentler, P.M., Comparative fit indexes in structural models (1990) Psychological Bulletin, 107, pp. 238-246; Edwards, R., Suresh, R., Lynch, S., Clarkson, P., Stanley, P., Illness perceptions and mood in chronic fatigue syndrome (2001) Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 50, pp. 65-68; Fan, X., Thompson, B., Wang, L., The effects of sample size, estimation methods, and model specification on SEM fit indices (1999) Structural Equation Modeling, 6, pp. 56-83; Firooz, A., Bouzari, N., Fallah, N., Ghazisaidi, B., Firoozabadi, M.R., Dowlati, Y., What patients with vitiligo believe about their condition (2004) International Journal of Dermatology, 43, pp. 811-814; Fortune, D.G., Richards, H.L., Main, C.J., Griffiths, C.E.M., What patients with psoriasis believe about their condition (1998) Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 39, pp. 196-201; Fortune, D.G., Richards, H.L., Main, C.J., Griffiths, C.E.M., Pathological worrying, illness perceptions and disease severity in patients with psoriasis (2000) British Journal of Health Psychology, 5, pp. 71-82; Fortune, D.G., Richards, H.L., Griffiths, C.E.M., Main, C.J., Psychological stress, distress and disability in patients with psoriasis: Consensus and variation in the contribution of illness perceptions, coping and alexithymia (2002) British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 41, pp. 157-174; Hagger, M.S., Orbell, S., A meta-analytic review of the common-sense model of illness representations (2003) Psychology and Health, 18, pp. 141-184; Hagger, S.M., Orbell, S., A confirmatory factor analysis of the revised illness perception questionnaire (IPQ-R) in a cervical screening context (2005) Psychology and Health, 20, pp. 161-173; Hashiro, M., Okumura, M., Anxiety, depression and psychosomatic symptoms in patients with atopic dermatitis: Comparison with normal controls and among groups of different degrees of severity (1997) Journal of Dermatological Science, 14, pp. 63-67; Heijmans, M., Coping and adaptive outcome in chronic fatigue syndrome: Importance of illness cognitions (1998) Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 45, pp. 39-51; Heijmans, M., The role of patients' illness representations in coping and functioning with Addison's disease (1999) British Journal of Health Psychology, 4, pp. 137-149; Holden, C.A., Parish, W.E., Atopic dermatitis (1998) Textbook of dermatology, 1. , R.

Initially, SAGE™ was performed to identify frequent tags differentially expressed in various skin diseases. On the basis of these results, a new skin pathology-oriented PIQOR™ microarray was designed. Lichen planus (LP) was chosen as a model disease to evaluate this system. Controls included healthy skin, atopic dermatitis (AD), and psoriasis (Pso). Gene expression analyses using the topic-defined microarray followed by unclassified clustering was able to discriminate LP from AD and Pso. Genes significantly expressed in LP included type I IFN inducible genes and a specific chemokine expression pattern. The CXCR3 ligand, CXCL9, was the most significant marker for LP. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry confirmed the results and revealed that keratinocytes are type I IFN producers in LP skin lesions. Our results show that gene expression profiling using a skin-specific microarray is a reliable method to identify patients with LP in the chosen context and reflect recent models concerning the pathogenesis of this disease. Gene expression profiling might complement the diagnostic spectrum in dermatology and may provide new pathogenetic insights. © 2007 The Society for Investigative Dermatology.",,"chemokine receptor CXCR3; CXCL9 chemokine; article; atopic dermatitis; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic value; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; keratinocyte; lichen planus; priority journal; psoriasis; skin defect; skin inflammation; statistical significance",,,"PIQOR",,,"This work was supported under the PTJ reference no. 0306v12 as part of the Technology and Innovation Program (TIP) North-Rhine Westphalia and by BONFOR (for JW and SZ).

Design: Prospective, longitudinal study. Setting: Two academic pediatric dermatology practices. Patients: A total of 301 parents of children younger than 6 years with atopic dermatitis. Main Outcome Measures: Participants completed the CADIS, sociodemographic items, and other clinical questions at enrollment and at a 4-week follow-up. In addition, 41 participants completed the CADIS again 48 hours after baseline. Disease severity was measured using the Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index for all children. Results: Of 301 enrolled participants, 270 (90%) completed the enrollment materials and 228 (84%) of these completed the 4-week follow-up materials. Thirty-four (83%) of the 41 participants completed the 48-hour materials. Intraclass correlation coefficients of CADIS scores at enrollment and at 48 hours ranged from 0.89 to 0.95. Correlations between CADIS scores and the SCORAD index scores (range, 0.42-0.72) demonstrated that more severe atopic dermatitis is associated with worse quality of life. Scores from all 5 domains of the CADIS significantly differentiated patients at each severity level as measured by the SCORAD index (P<.001). Participants who rated their children as ""improved"" at the 4-week follow-up had significantly better CADIS scores than those who rated their children as having the ""same"" or ""worse"" skin disease (P<.05). Conclusions: These data confirm the test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and discriminative validity of the CADIS. In addition, responsiveness evaluation demonstrates that the CADIS accurately measures change in patients whose disease improves. ©2007 American Medical Association.

Study design: 1153 children and adolescents (8-16 years) with chronic health conditions (asthma, arthritis, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, diabetes, atopic dermatitis, cystic fibrosis) and their family were recruited from different paediatric clinical settings in seven European countries. A two-time assessment comprised reports on sociodemographics, health status and HRQL of children/adolescents. Results: The 37-item DCGM describes six dimensions (Independence, Physical Limitation, Emotion, Social Inclusion, Social Exclusion and Treatment) confirmed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis, multi-item scaling and item-goodness of fit to Rasch model. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.70-0.87) and test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.71-0.83) were satisfactory. Correlations between DCGM-37 and other HRQL instruments were the highest between dimensions evaluating similar concepts. Regarding discriminant validity of the DCGM-37, girls and older adolescents reported lower emotional we ll-being. Children belonging to families with low level of affluence and those with severe health conditions were found to have worse HRQL in all domains.

Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of treatment with tacrolimus ointment vs. standard treatment in patients with moderate to severe AD. Methods: A Markov simulation model was constructed capturing several key features of AD and its treatment: disease severity, treatment alternatives, and QoL. The model was populated with data from three sources: (i) efficacy data from a randomized controlled trial including patients with moderate to severe AD treated with either tacrolimus ointment or standard treatment (corticosteroids), (ii) resource utilization and QoL data from a patient survey including 161 Swedish patients with AD, and (iii) official price lists. Costs were calculated according to disease severity for the two treatment alternatives using the perspective of the Swedish healthcare sector. Two analyses were performed, one based on the quantity of medication used in the trial and one based on the survey data. The relationship between effectiveness of tacrolimus ointment and the amount of medication used was tested in sensitivity analyses. Results: In the model simulations patients with severe AD treated with tacrolimus ointment experienced on average 4·6 more AD-free weeks per year than patients given standard treatment. The corresponding figure for patients with moderate AD was 6·5 more AD-free weeks per year. The cost-effectiveness ratios [cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained] for treatment with tacrolimus ointment vs. standard treatment were £2334 for moderate AD and £3875 for severe AD when treatment patterns from the survey were assumed, and £8269 for moderate AD and £12 304 for severe AD when treatment patterns from the clinical trial were assumed. The results of sensitivity analyses were all well within limits to be considered cost-effective. Conclusions: Estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio are far below the currently discussed threshold in Sweden, corresponding to approximately £48 700 per QALY gained, and equivalent thresholds in other countries. Treatment with tacrolimus ointment in patients with moderate and severe AD can therefore be considered cost-effective. © 2007 British Association of Dermatologists.","Atopic dermatitis; Cost-effectiveness; Model simulation; Tacrolimus ointment","corticosteroid; hydrocortisone butyrate; tacrolimus; adult; article; atopic dermatitis; calculation; clinical feature; comparative study; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; disease severity; drug efficacy; female; health care cost; health care utilization; health economics; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; sensitivity analysis; simulation; Adult; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Health Care Costs; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Male; Markov Chains; Models, Economic; Ointments; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Sweden; Tacrolimus",,"hydrocortisone butyrate, 13609-67-1; tacrolimus, 104987-11-3; Immunosuppressive Agents; Ointments; Tacrolimus, 109581-93-3",,,,,,,,"Kiebert, G., Sorensen, S.V., Revicki, D., Atopic dermatitis is associated with decrement in health-related quality of life (2002) Int J Dermatol, 41, pp. 151-8; Lamb, S.R., Rademaker, M., Pharmacoeconomics of drug therapy for atopic dermatitis (2002) Exper Opin Pharmacother, 3, pp. 249-55; Ellis, C.N., Drake, L.A., Prendergast, M.M., Cost-effectiveness analysis of tacrolimus ointment versus high-potency topical corticosteroids in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (2003) J Am Acad Dermatol, 48, pp. 553-63; Abramovits, W., Boguniewicz, M., Paller, A.S., The economics of topical immunomodulators for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (2005) Pharmacoeconomics, 23, pp. 543-66; Reitamo, S., Harper, J., Bos, J.D., 0.03% tacrolimus ointment applied once or twice daily is more efficacious than 1% hydrocortisone acetate in children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis: Results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial (2004) Br J Dermatol, 150, pp. 554-62; Koo, J.Y.M., Fleischerjr., A.B., Abramovits, W., Tacrolimus ointment is safe and effective in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: Results in 8000 patients (2005) J Am Acad Dermatol, 53, pp. S195-205; Hanifin, J.M., Ling, M.R., Langley, R., Tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in adult patients: Part I, efficacy (2001) J Am Acad Dermatol, 44, pp. S28-38; Briggs, A., Sculpher, M., An introduction to Markov modelling for economic evaluation (1998) Pharmacoeconomics, 13, pp. 397-409; Sonnenberg, F.A., Beck, J.R., Markov models in medical decision making: A practical guide (1993) Med Decis Making, 13, pp. 322-38; (2003) General Guidelines for Economic Evaluations from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Board, , Läkemedelsförmånsnämnden.

Our aim was to evaluate whether in Sweden the incidence of CAD varies spatially, and to investigate possible environmental causes of such variation in a longitudinal study of CAD incidence among insured Swedish dogs. The dataset consisted of >220,000 individuals which had been covered by an insurance plan between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2002. Out of these, 1235 CAD cases were identified and matched to postal-code areas based upon the address of the owner. Environmental risk factors we considered included averages of long-term annual rainfall, and of January and July temperatures. Initial visualization of the incidence rate of CAD (cases/dog-years at risk) expressed as empirical Bayes smoothed spatial rates indicated geographic variation. Moran's I, adjusted for population at risk, revealed significant global clustering. Both the spatial scan statistic and a local indicator of spatial autocorrelation revealed a higher incidence of CAD in the major cities. In a Poisson-regression model (with a spatial covariance structure), the incidence of CAD increased with increasing human population density, increasing average annual rainfall, living in the southern half of Sweden, and having a veterinary dermatologist in the county. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We study multivariate procedures, in particular use of Hotelling's T2 for discrimination between the groups with a special emphasis on methods based on few genes only. We apply the methods to data from an experiment with a group of atopic dermatitis patients compared with a control group. We also compare our methodology to other recently proposed methods on publicly available datasets. It is found that (i) use of several genes gives a much improved discrimination of the groups as compared to one gene only, (ii) the genes that play the most important role in the multivariate analysis are not necessarily those that rank first in univariate comparisons of the groups, (iii) Linear Discriminant Analysis carried out with sets of 2-5 genes selected according to their Hotelling T2 give results comparable to state-of-the-art methods using many more genes, a feature of our method which might be crucial in clinical applications. Finding groups of genes that together give optimal multivariate discrimination (given the size of the group) can identify crucial pathways and networks of genes responsible for a disease.

The SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCOARD) is a widely used clinical score for assessing AD symptomatology over the preceding 3 days and the Nottingham Eczema Severity Score (NESS) is another score useful for AD symptoms over the preceding 12 months. Objective: We evaluated if these parameters are correlated with QOL in children with AD. Patients/Methods: We assessed quality of life, clinical scores, total IgE and eosinophil count in peripheral blood in AD patients at our paediatric dermatology clinic over a 14-month period. Results: Eighty AD patients (42 males and 38 females; mean [SD] age 11.7 [3.7] years) were recruited. The median (interquartile range, IQR) IgE, eosinophil counts and eosinophil percentage were 2988 (1069-7847) kIU/L; 0.6 (0.4-0.9) × 10-9/L; and 9 (6-12)%, respectively. Quality of life as measured with CDLQI (The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index) generally did not correlate well with both the acute and chronic AD severity scores (objective SCORAD and total CDQLI, ρ = 0.17, p &gt; 0.05; total NESS and total CDQLI, ρ = 0.29, p &lt; 0.05). Factor analysis further confirmed that the objective indicators (serum total IgE, eosinophil count and objective SCORAD), self-reported scores (NESS and subjective SCORAD) and CDLQI were separate dimensions in the assessment of AD in children. Conclusion: Quality of life, disease severity scores and laboratory atopic markers represent different domains in AD assessment. They do not necessarily correlate well with each other and all three aspects must be individually evaluated to assess the well-being of these patients. © 2006 Springer.","Atopic dermatitis; CDLQI; Children; Factor analysis; NESS; Quality of life; SCORAD","immunoglobulin E; article; atopic dermatitis; blood; children dermatology life quality index; correlation analysis; disease severity; eosinophil count; factorial analysis; female; human; immunoglobulin blood level; major clinical study; male; medical parameters; nottingham eczema severity score; pediatric hospital; priority journal; quality of life; school child; SCORing Atopic Dermatitis; scoring system; Adolescent; Biological Markers; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Biological Markers",,,,,,,,"Charman, C., Williams, H., Outcome measures of disease severity in atopic eczema (2000) Arch Dermatol, 136, pp. 763-769; Charman, C., Chambers, C., Williams, H., Measuring atopic dermatitis severity in randomized controlled clinical trials: What exactly are we measuring?

Due to the proximity of these two cell types, activation of MCs may affect DC functions. Here, we co-cultured human monocyte-derived DCs with cord blood-derived MCs activated by cross-linking of FcεRI to elucidate the net effect of the whole MC products on DCs. Activated MCs induced maturation of DCs, and potently suppressed IL-12p70 production by the DCs. Whereas co-culture of DCs with activated MCs alone did not significantly influence the type of CD4+ T cell responses induced by the DCs, DCs co-cultured with activated MCs in the presence of pro-inflammatory or Th1-inducing factors caused Th2 polarization. Although histamine was involved in the induction of DC maturation and Th2 polarization by activated MCs, a combinatorial effect of various MC-derived factors, including those acting in a cell contact-dependent manner, was required for the optimal induction of Th2-promoting DCs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that clusters of DCs are located closely with MCs in lesions of atopic dermatitis. Collectively, this study suggests that the interaction between DCs and IgE-activated MCs in a pro-inflammatory or even Th1-prone environment is instrumental in maintaining and augmenting Th2 responses in allergy, and that disruption of the DC-MC interaction may constitute an effective strategy to treat ongoing allergic diseases. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",,"histamine; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 12p70; allergic disease; article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell activation; cell disruption; cell function; cell interaction; cell maturation; cellular distribution; cellular immunity; cluster analysis; coculture; controlled study; dendritic cell; human; human cell; immunopathogenesis; mast cell; polarization; priority journal; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Dendritic Cells; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Fetal Blood; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Inflammation; Interleukin-12; Mast Cells; Th2 Cells",,"histamine, 51-45-6, 56-92-8, 93443-21-1; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Interleukin-12, 187348-17-0",,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT","We thank Yoshinobu Toda (Center for Anatomical Studies, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University) for excellent technical support in immunohistochemistry and Keiko Fukunaga for excellent technical assistance.

Nevertheless, AD patients are rarely treated for their psychosomatic concerns. The purpose of the present study was to develop and validate a brief self-rating scale for adult AD in order to aid dermatologists in evaluating psychosocial factors during the course of AD. A preliminary scale assessing stress-induced exacerbation, the secondary psychosocial burden, and attitude toward treatment was developed and administered to 187 AD patients (82 male, 105 female, aged 28.4 ± 7.8, 13-61). Severity of skin lesions and improvement with standard dermatological treatment were assessed by both the dermatologist and the participant. Measures of anxiety and depression were also determined. In addition, psychosomatic evaluations were made according to the Psychosomatic Diagnostic Criteria for AD. Factor analysis resulted in the development of a 12-item scale (The Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis; PSS-AD) consisting of three factors: (i) exacerbation triggered by stress; (ii) disturbances due to AD; and (iii) ineffective control. Internal consistency indicated by Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.86 for the entire measure, 0.82 for (i), 0.81 for (ii), and 0.77 for (iii), verifying the acceptable reliability of PSS-AD. Patients with psychosomatic problems had higher PSS-AD scores than those without. PSS-AD scores were positively associated with the severity of the skin lesions, anxiety and depression. The scores were negatively associated with improvement during dermatological treatments. In conclusion, PSS-AD is a simple and reliable measure of the psychosomatic pathology of adult AD patients. It may be useful in dermatological practice for screening patients who would benefit from psychological or psychiatric interventions. © 2006 Japanese Dermatological Association.","Atopic dermatitis; Psychosocial factors; Psychosomatic disease; Quality of life; Stress","adolescent; adult; anxiety; article; atopic dermatitis; controlled study; depression; disease course; disease exacerbation; disease severity; female; human; major clinical study; male; patient attitude; psychiatric diagnosis; Psychosomatic Diagnostic Criteria; psychosomatic disorder; Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis; quality of life; rating scale; school child; scoring system; screening test; self concept; social psychology; stress; validation process; Adolescent; Adult; Dermatitis, Atopic; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results",,,,,,,,,,"Sugiura, H., Umemoto, N., Deguchi, H., Prevalence of childhood and adolescent atopic dermatitis in a Japanese population: Comparison with disease frequency examined 20 years ago (1998) Acta Derm Venereol, 78, pp. 293-294; Yura, A., Shimize, T., Trends in the prevalence of atopic dermatitis in school children: Longitudinal study in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, from 1985-1997 (2001) Br J Dermatol, 145, pp. 966-973; Muto, T., Hsieh, S.D., Sakurai, Y., Prevalence of atopic dermatitis in Japanese adults (2003) Br J Dermatol, 148, pp. 117-121; Nishioka, K., Atopic eczema of adult type in Japan (1996) Australas J Dermatol, 37, pp. S7-S9; Yoshikawa, K., Aoki, T., Tezuka, T., The report of the survey on severe adult atopic dermatitis in Osaka Prefecture (1996) Hifu, 38, pp. 1-70; Rajka, G., Atopic dermatitis.

Pimecrolimus, an immunosuppressant, was licensed in the U.K. in 2003 as an alternative treatment of mild to moderate atopic eczema. Objectives: To assess the cost-utility of pimecrolimus as a treatment for mild and moderate atopic eczema when compared with conventional treatments which use TCS and emollients. Methods: A Markov state-transition model was developed to represent the cyclical nature of atopic eczema and provide an economic analysis of cost-utility for treatment alternatives from the perspective of a third party payer (U.K. National Health Service). A range of methods was used to obtain data for transition probabilities, costs and quality of life. These included a systematic review of published effectiveness data, expert opinion, and a utility study conducted by the authors. Separate cohort analyses were modelled to distinguish between children and adult populations and between differing treatment patterns for facial and body eczema. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (using Monte-Carlo simulation) were performed. Results: Baseline cost-utility outputs from the model show that, in all tested scenarios, TCS dominate pimecrolimus (i.e. TCS are both cheaper and more effective). However, the differences in benefits between treatments output by the model are very small. Sensitivity analyses highlight the importance of cost variations in pimecrolimus. Where pimecrolimus is compared with emollient only it is probably cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30 000 per quality-adjusted life year. Conclusions: There are likely to be few situations in which the use of pimecrolimus for the treatment of atopic eczema can be justified on economic grounds. Exceptions are likely to be in cases where TCS have been shown to be ineffective, unacceptable due to adverse events, or where a patient is unwilling to accept TCS treatment despite appropriate education and support and emollient alone is the alternative clinical option. © 2006 British Association of Dermatologists.","Atopic dermatitis; Cost-utility analysis; Health economics; Immunosuppressant","corticosteroid; emollient agent; pimecrolimus; application site burning; atopic dermatitis; cohort analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; disease severity; human; priority journal; pruritus; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; review; sensitivity analysis; side effect; skin infection; skin manifestation; systematic review; Adult; Child; Costs and Cost Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Drug Costs; Drug Therapy, Combination; Emollients; England; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Markov Chains; Quality of Life; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index; Tacrolimus; Treatment Failure; Treatment Outcome",,"pimecrolimus, 137071-32-0; Emollients; Glucocorticoids; Immunosuppressive Agents; pimecrolimus; Tacrolimus, 109581-93-3",,,,,,,,"Williams H, C., Strachan, D.P., The natural history of childhood eczema: Observations from the British 1958 birth cohort study (2003) Br J Dermatol, 139, pp. 834-9; Charman C, R., Morris, A.D., Williams, H.C., Topical corticosteroid phobia in patients with atopic eczema (2000) Br J Dermatol, 142, pp. 931-6; Ashcroft D, M., Dimmock, P., Garside, R., Efficacy and tolerability of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (2005) BMJ, 330, p. 516; Eichenfield L, F., Lucky, A.W., Boguniewicz, M., Safety and efficacy of pimecrolimus (ASM 981) cream 1% in the treatment of mild and moderate atopic dermatitis in children and adolescents (2002) J Am Acad Dermatol, 46, pp. 495-504; Whalley D, Huels, J., McKenna, S.P., The benefit of pimecrolimus (Elidel, SDZ ASM 981) on parents' quality of life in the treatment of pediatric atopic dermatitis (2002) Pediatrics, 110, pp. 1133-6; Wahn U, Bos, J.D., Goodfield, M., Efficacy and safety of pimecrolimus cream in the long-term management of atopic dermatitis in children (2002) Pediatrics, 110, p. 2; Meurer M, Folster-Holst, R., Wozel, G., Pimecrolimus cream in the long-term management of atopic dermatitis in adults: A six-month study (2002) Dermatology, 205, pp. 271-7; Luger T, Van Leent, E.J., Graeber, M., SDZ ASM 981: An emerging safe and effective treatment for atopic dermatitis (2001) Br J Dermatol, 144, pp. 788-94; Weinstein M, C., O'Brien, B., Hornberger, J., Principles of good practice for decision analytic modeling in health-care evaluation: Report of the ISPOR Task Force on Good Research Practices - Modeling Studies (2003) Value Health, 6, pp. 9-17; Finlay A, Y., Measurement of disease activity and outcome in atopic dermatitis (1996) Br J Dermatol, 135, pp. 509-15; Stevens K, Brazier, J., McKenna, S., The development of a preference based measure of health in children with atopic eczema (2005) Sheffield Health Economics Group Discussion Paper; The PenTAG Value of Health Panel, , website: (accessed 30 June 2005); British National Formulary, , British Medical Association & Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain No. 49; Su J, C., Kemp, A.S., Varigos, G.A., Atopic eczema: Its impact on the family and financial cost (1997) Arch Dis Child, 76, pp. 159-62; Briggs A, H., Gray, A.M., Handling uncertainty when performing economic evaluations of healthcare interventions (1999) Health Technol Assess, 3, pp. 1-134; Fenwick E, Claxton, K., Sculpher, M., Representing uncertainty: The role of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (2001) Health Econ, 10, pp. 779-87; U.S. Food and Drug Administration website: (accessed 12 October 2005)","Pitt, M.; Peninsula Technology Assessment Group, , Southernhay East, Exeter EX1 1PQ, United Kingdom; email: m.pitt@exeter.ac.uk",,,,,,,,00070963,,BJDEA,"16704646","English","Br.

Objective: To determine if 1% pimecrolimus cream is cost-effective in treating mild-to-moderate AD in patients 2-17 years of age. Methods: Data on the efficacy of AD management with 1% pimecrolimus cream (Elidel®, Novartis Pharma GmbH, Wehr, Germany) were obtained from a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, multinational, controlled clinical trial comparing pimecrolimus and conventional therapy. Markov modeling was used for the economic model, based on: (i) Investigator's Global Assessment scores assessed at each visit during the clinical trial; (ii) estimated costs for medication and physician visits for each level of disease severity; and (iii) utility values for each level of disease severity. The perspective was that of a third-party payer. Results: In 2004 US dollars, the incremental cost-effectiveness of 1% pimecrolimus cream was $US38 231 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared with conventional therapy. Sensitivity analyses showed a range of $US27 299 to $US63 457 per QALY gained. Conclusion: With an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of <$US50 000 per QALY gained, 1% pimecrolimus cream offers a cost-effective therapeutic option in the management of AD. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV.

We now report the development of a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay that uses expression values for just 5 of those genes: STAT4, GATA-3, PLS3, CD1D, and TRAIL. qRT-PCR data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) accurately classified 88% of 17 patients with high blood tumor burden and 100% of 12 healthy controls in the training set using Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA). The same 5 genes were then assayed on 56 new samples from 49 SS patients with blood tumor burdens of 5% to 99% and 69 samples from 65 new healthy controls. The average accuracy over 1000 resamplings was 90% using FLDA and 88% using support vector machine (SVM). We also tested the classifier on 14 samples from patients with CTCL with no detectable peripheral involvement and 3 patients with atopic dermatitis with severe erythroderma. The accuracy was 100% in identifying these samples as non-SS patients. These results are the first to demonstrate that gene expression profiling by quantitative PCR on a selected number of critical genes can be employed to molecularly diagnosis SS. © 2006 by The American Society of Hematology.",,"CD1d antigen; plastin t; protein; STAT4 protein; transcription factor GATA 3; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; unclassified drug; adult; aged; article; atopic dermatitis; blood sampling; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; controlled study; cutaneous T cell lymphoma; data analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic procedure; discriminant analysis; disease severity; erythroderma; gene; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene identification; gene pls3; human; human tissue; major clinical study; microarray analysis; oncogene; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Sezary syndrome; training; tumor cell; tumor volume; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dermatitis, Exfoliative; Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic; Humans; Predictive Value of Tests; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sezary Syndrome; Skin Neoplasms; Tumor Burden",,"protein, 67254-75-5; transcription factor GATA 3, 137878-55-8",,,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: P30CA010815, R01CA106553, T32CA009171, U01CA085060

The course of disease is notoriously changeable and runs in phases, therefore it is difficult to predict the future course of disease. To improve prediction it would be interesting to identify clusters of children with different disease histories because this would shed light on common genetic and environmental risk factors. We use, relying on previous work of Nagin, a Latent class mixture model to estimate, in a data-dependent and model-based fashion, a clustering of typical binary atopic dermatitis disease histories in children. The data were collected from 1990 to 1997 in the so called MAS-study, a prospective cohort study of 1314 children in five German cities. The original method of Nagin is extended in two different aspects, first we use bootstrap confidence intervals to account for uncertainty in curve fitting, and second, we propose to model covariates for cluster membership by Anderson's Stereotype regression model. We feel that the Latent class mixture model is a valuable tool for assessing the course of atopic dermatitis, yielding a wealth of communicable and graphically displayable results. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The prevalence and signs of respiratory disease in AD patients have been studied to a limited extent. Objectives: To assess the prevalence and clustering of respiratory symptoms, bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR), and eosinophilic airway inflammation in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Methods: Eighty-six consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe AD and 49 randomly selected control subjects without AD were studied by questionnaire, flow volume spirometry, histamine challenge to detect BHR, induced sputum test to detect eosinophilic airway inflammation, and skin prick tests (SPTs) and total serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E measurements to detect atopy. Results: The patients with AD showed increased risk of physician-diagnosed asthma (36% vs. 2%, odds ratio (OR) 10.1, confidence interval (CI) 1.3-79.7, P=0.03), physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis (AR) (45% vs. 6%, OR 4.5, CI 1.2-16.7, P=0.02), BHR (51% vs. 10%, OR 5.5, CI 1.5-20.1, P=0.01), and sputum eosinophilia (81% vs. 11%, OR 76.1, CI 9.3-623.5, P<0.0001) compared with the control subjects. In AD patients, elevated s-IgE and positive SPTs were associated with the occurrence of physician-diagnosed asthma and AR, BHR, and the presence of sputum eosinophilia. Conclusions: BHR and eosinophilic airway inflammation are more common in patients with AD than in control subjects. The highest prevalences were seen in patients with AD who were SPT positive and had high IgE levels. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess the outcome of patients with signs of airway disease, in order to identify those who need early initiation of asthma treatment. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Allergic rhinitis; Asthma; Atopic dermatitis; Brochial hyper-responsiveness; Serum immunoglobin E; Skin prick tests; Sputum eosinophilia","histamine; immunoglobulin E; adult; allergic asthma; allergic rhinitis; article; atopic dermatitis; atopy; bronchus hyperreactivity; confidence interval; controlled study; disease severity; eosinophilia; female; human; immunoglobulin blood level; major clinical study; male; prevalence; prick test; priority journal; questionnaire; randomization; respiratory tract allergy; respiratory tract inflammation; risk assessment; spirometry; sputum examination; Adult; Asthma; Bronchial Hyperreactivity; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Eosinophilia; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Logistic Models; Male; Respiratory Function Tests; Sputum",,"histamine, 51-45-6, 56-92-8, 93443-21-1; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,,"(1987) Standards for the Diagnosis and Care of Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Asthma.

The prototype CADIS was developed from a comprehensive conceptual framework based on data from parents and clinicians. The instrument had eight subscales (four each for child and parent): physical health, emotional health, physical functioning, and social functioning. The goal of this work was to test the validity of and to refine the prototype of CADIS. Two hundred seventy parents of children under the age of 6 y with AD responded to the instrument. Content validity was demonstrated by expert and parent reviews of the drafted and refined instrument, and by analyzing parents' responses to open-ended questions about their children's skin disease. Construct validity was assessed in exploratory factor analyses which supported a refinement in the conceptual framework to consist of two dimensions with five domains: child dimensions (symptoms and activity limitation/behavior), and parent dimensions (family/ social function, sleep, and emotions). Seventeen items were eliminated, yielding a 45-item refined version of CADIS (score 0-180) with evidence of content and construct validity and suggested use in clinical research.

We describe the development of the seven cross-nationally tested condition-specific modules of the European DISABKIDS HRQoL instrument in a population of children and adolescents. The condition-specific modules are intended for use in conjunction with the DISABKIDS chronic generic module. Methods: Focus groups, existing questionnaires, and literature reviews were used to construct the pilot version of the DISABKIDS condition-specific HRQoL modules for asthma, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, diabetes and epilepsy. Analyses were conducted on pilot test data in order to construct field test versions of the modules. A series of factor analyses were run, first, to determine potential structures for each condition-specific module, and, secondly, to select a reduced number of items from the pilot test to be included in the field test. Post-field test analyses were conducted to retest the domain structure for the final DISABKIDS condition-specific modules. Results: The DISABKIDS condition-specific modules were tested in a pilot study of 360 respondents, and subsequently in a field test of 1152 respondents in 7 European countries. The final condition-specific modules consist of an 'Impact' domain and an additional domain (e.g. worry, stigma, treatment) with between 10 to 12 items in total. The Cronbach's alpha of the final domains was found to vary from 0.71 to 0.90. Conclusions: The condition-specific modules of the DISABKIDS instrument were developed through a step-by-step process including cognitive interview, clinical expertise, factor analysis, correlations and internal consistency. A cross-national pilot and field test were necessary to collect these data. In general, the internal consistency of the domains was satisfactory to high. In future, the DISABKIDS instrument may serve as a useful tool with which to assess HRQoL in children and adolescents with a chronic condition. The condition-specific modules can be used in conjunction with the DISABKIDS chronic generic module. © 2005 Baars et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adolescent; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; cerebral palsy; child; child health care; chronic disease; cognition; correlation analysis; cystic fibrosis; data analysis; diabetes mellitus; epilepsy; Europe; factorial analysis; female; human; interview; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; major clinical study; male; medical literature; pilot study; population research; quality of life; questionnaire; social behavior; treatment planning; anxiety; classification; cost of illness; Europe; family; handicapped child; information processing; international cooperation; psychological aspect; questionnaire; Sickness Impact Profile; social psychology; statistical model; Adolescent; Anxiety; Child; Chronic Disease; Cost of Illness; Disabled Children; Europe; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Family; Focus Groups; Humans; Internationality; Models, Statistical; Pilot Projects; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Sickness Impact Profile; Stereotyping",,,,,,,,,,"Andelman, R.B., Zima, B.T., Rosenblatt, A.B., Quality of Life of Children: Toward Conceptual Clarity (1999) The Use of Psychological Testing for Treatment Planning and Outcomes Assessment, pp. 1383-1413. , Edited by Maruish ME.

Whether the epictemiological picture of GCS does support a multiple infectious etiology is unknown. Objective: To analyze the presence of temporal clustering in patients with GCS. Patients and methods: We retrieved all clinical records of patients with GCS in a dermatology clinic during a period of 30 months. We analyzed temporal clustering by a method based on a regression model. Similarly, we retrieved all clinical records of patients with scabies (infectious, as positive control condition) and atopic dermatitis (non-infectious, as negative control condition) diagnosed in a similar setting. Results: 47 cases of GCS, 35 cases of scabies and 564 cases of atopic dermatitis were identified. No significant temporal cluster was found for patients with GCS. For patients with scabies, statistically significant clustering of 20 cases was detected (p = 0.025). For patients with atopic dermatitis, no significant temporal cluster was found. Conclusion: The epidemiology evidence does not support GCS as having a single infectious etiology.

From the BodyMap database, we selected 2007 genes which specifically expressed in epithelial tissues. Among 2007 genes, we surveyed genes which differentially expressed in involved or uninvolved psoriatic lesional skin samples compared with atopic dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, and normal skin samples. As a result of surveying 2007 genes, 241 genes were differentially expressed only in involved psoriatic skin but not in the other samples. Hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression profiles showed that 13 independent psoriatic-involved skin samples clustered tightly together, reflecting highly similar expression profiles. Using the same 2007 gene set, we examined gene expression levels in five serial lesions from distal uninvolved psoriatic skin to involved psoriatic plaque. We identified seven genes such as alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor, calnexin, claudin 1, leucine zipper down-regulated in cancer 1, tyrosinase-related protein 1, Yes-associated protein 1, and unc-13-like protein (Coleonyx elegans) which show high-expression levels only in uninvolved psoriatic lesions. These seven genes, which were reported to be related to apoptosis or antiproliferation, might have causal roles in pathophysiology in psoriasis. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2005.","Expression profiling; Psoriasis; Susceptibility genes","alpha 1 microglobulin; aquaporin 3; beta defensin 4; calnexin; CD24 antigen; claudin 1; cysteine proteinase inhibitor; cytokeratin 1; cytokeratin 14; cytokeratin 16; gene product; leucine zipper protein; protein glutamine gamma glutamyltransferase; serine proteinase inhibitor; stefin A; tyrosinase related protein 1; ulinastatin; unc 13 like protein; unclassified drug; Yes associated protein 1; amplified fragment length polymorphism; apoptosis; article; cluster analysis; controlled study; epithelium; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene identification; human; human tissue; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; psoriasis; psoriasis vulgaris; skin defect; Apoptosis; Cluster Analysis; Databases; Epithelial Cells; Epithelium; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Keratinocytes; Membrane Proteins; Mycosis Fungoides; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Presenilin-1; Presenilin-2; Psoriasis; RNA; Skin",,"calnexin, 139873-08-8; claudin 1, 329338-06-9; protein glutamine gamma glutamyltransferase, 80146-85-6; stefin A, 107544-29-6; ulinastatin, 80449-32-7; Membrane Proteins; PSEN1 protein, human; PSEN2 protein, human; Presenilin-1; Presenilin-2; RNA, 63231-63-0",,,,,,,,"Bhalerao, J., Bowcock, A.M., The genetics of psoriasis: A complex disorder of the skin and immune system (1998) Hum.

We performed a family-based genotyping study to test for association between KD and 58 genes involved in cardiovascular disease and inflammation. By analysis of a cohort of 209 KD trios using the transmission disequilibrium test, we documented the asymmetric transmission of five alleles including the interleukin-4 (IL-4) C(-589)T allele (P=0.03). Asymmetric transmission of the IL-4 C(-589)T was replicated in a second, independent cohort of 60 trios (P=0.05, combined P=0.002). Haplotypes of alleles in IL-4, colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2), IL-13, and transcription factor 7 (TCF7), all located in the interleukin gene cluster on 5q31, were also asymmetrically transmitted. The reported associations of KD with atopic dermatitis and allergy, elevated serum IgE levels, eosinophilia, and increased circulating numbers of monocyte/macrophages expressing the low-affinity IgE receptor (FCεR2) may be related to effects of IL-4. Thus, the largest family-based genotyping study of KD patients to date suggests that genetic variation in the IL-4 gene, or regions linked to IL-4, plays an important role in KD pathogenesis and disease susceptibility. © 2005 Natures Publishing Group All rights reserved.","Coronary artery aneurysm; Pediatrics; Polymorphism; Th2 immune response; Transmission disequilibrium test; Vasculitis","colony stimulating factor; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E receptor; interleukin 13; interleukin 4; transcription factor; allele; allergy; article; atopic dermatitis; cardiovascular disease; cell count; child; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary artery aneurysm; disease predisposition; disease transmission; eosinophilia; evidence based medicine; family history; female; gene cluster; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genotype; haplotype; human; human cell; immunoglobulin blood level; inflammation; macrophage; major clinical study; male; monocyte; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; pathogenesis; priority journal; vasculitis; Child; Child, Preschool; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5; Cohort Studies; Coronary Aneurysm; Dermatitis, Atopic; Eosinophilia; Family; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Interleukin-4; Macrophages; Male; Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome; Receptors, IgE; Vasculitis",,"colony stimulating factor, 62683-29-8; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; Immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Interleukin-4, 207137-56-2; Receptors, IgE",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

Methods: To further examine the relationship between nickel, cobalt, chromate, and the factors that may potentially be related to concurrent sensitizations to two or all three metal allergens, data from the Information Network of Dermatology Departments (IVDK, http://www.ivdk.org) have been investigated. Results: Women had a higher conditional odds of concurrent nickel-cobalt (OR = 6.80; 95% CI: 5.65-8.19) and nickel-chromate (OR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.67-2.72) reactions than men. Construction workers had a significantly higher odds of cobalt-chromate reactions (OR = 13.89; 95% CI: 10.36-18.64), while the odds of isolated cobalt allergy was only 0.92 (95% CI: 0.48-1.74). Patients with underlying atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome had a 40-90% higher chance of any positive outcome, which involved chromate. Polysensitization, defined as the number of positive reactions to standard series substances other than nickel, cobalt, and chromate, was also significantly associated with the concurrent reactions; moreover, steady and significant effect gradients were noted. Conclusions: This research confirms the occupational nature of cobalt-chromate concurrent reactions, in particular, in construction workers. Polysensitization, which is considered to represent susceptibility to delayed-hypersensitivity in general, is also associated with the concurrent reactions to the metals. Hence, not only coupled exposure, but also individual susceptibility may be responsible for concurrent reactions to metals in man.

Nonetheless, linkage analyses have repeatedly shown that the PSORS1 locus account for less than 50% of the disease family clustering. On this basis, it is widely agreed that additional loci must contribute to psoriasis susceptibility, either by interacting directly with or by modifying the effect of the PSORS1 gene(s). To date, at least eight putative disease susceptibility regions have been mapped outside of the MHC (PSORS2-9). However, the search for the underlying genetic determinants has been seriously hindered by the difficulty of replicating linkage to these loci. The small disease-risk conferred by non-MHC genes and the likely occurrence of genetic heterogeneity are regarded as the main factors affecting the power of linkage studies and confounding the interpretation of experimental results. Evidence supporting some non-MHC loci has been provided by their close overlap with genomic regions conferring susceptibility to other inflammatory disorders. These observations indicate that clinically distinct autoimmune diseases might share common pathogenic pathways, suggesting that future advances in the understanding of single disorders could benefit the wider research community studying common inflammatory diseases. ©2005 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Non-MHC loci; Psoriasis susceptibility","cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; DNA; transcription factor RUNX1; allele; atopic dermatitis; autoimmune disease; DNA modification; gene cluster; gene interaction; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; gene mapping; gene replication; genetic association; genetic heterogeneity; genetic identification; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; Graves disease; human; hypothyroidism; immunopathogenesis; inflammatory disease; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; major histocompatibility complex; medical research; multigene family; psoriasis; review; rheumatoid arthritis; single nucleotide polymorphism; systemic lupus erythematosus",,"DNA, 9007-49-2",,,,,,,,"Barker, J.N., Pathogenesis of psoriasis (1998) J.

Data sources: Electronic databases. Experts and the manufacturers of these agents were also approached for information. Review methods: The systematic review was carried out using standard methodological guidelines and a stringent quality assessment strategy. A state transition (Markov) model was developed to estimate cost-utility of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus separately, compared with current standard practice with topical corticosteroids, (a) as first-line treatment and (b) as second-line treatment. Pimecrolimus was also compared to emollients only. Results: The pimecrolimus trial reports were of varying quality; however when compared with a placebo (emollient), pimecrolimus was found to be more effective and to provide quality of life improvements. There is very little evidence available about pimecrolimus compared with topical corticosteroids. Compared with a placebo (emollient), both 0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus were found to be more effective. Compared with a mild corticosteroid, 0.03% tacrolimus is more effective in children as measured by a 90% or better improvement in the Physician's Global Evaluation (PGE). Compared with potent topical corticosteroids, no significant difference in effectiveness is seen with 0.1% tacrolimus as measured by a 75% or greater improvement in the PGE. Minor application site adverse effects are common with tacrolimus. However, this did not lead to increased rates of withdrawal from treatment in trial populations. The Pen Tag economic model demonstrates a large degree of uncertainty, which was explored in both deterministic and stochastic analyses. This is the case for the cost-effectiveness of pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in first- or second-line use compared with topical steroids. In all cases immunosuppressant regimes were estimated to be more costly than alternatives and differences in benefits to be small and subject to considerable uncertainty. Conclusions: There is limited evidence from a small number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that pimecrolimus is more effective than placebo treatment in controlling mild to moderate atopic eczema. Although greater than for pimecrolimus, the evidence base for tacrolimus in moderate to severe atopic eczema is also limited. At both 0.1% and 0.03% potencies, tacrolimus appears to be more effective than the placebo treatment and mild topical corticosteroids. However, these are not the most clinically relevant comparators. Compared with potent topical corticosteroids, no significant difference was shown. Short-term adverse effects with both immunosuppressants are relatively common, but appear to be mild. Experience of long-term use of the agents is lacking so the risk of rare but serious adverse effects remains unknown. No conclusions can be confidently drawn about the cost-effectiveness of pimecrolimus or tacrolimus compared with active topical corticosteroid comparators. Areas for further research should focus on the effectiveness and safety of the treatments through good-quality RCTs and further economic analysis. © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2005.

METHODS - A Markov-model for atopic dermatitis developed by the Erasmus University (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) was adopted to the Hungarian health care setting. The model is based on a double-blind, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group stud.. patients were randomised (2:1) to receive pimecrolimus treatment. (i.e. emollients, pimecrolimus medium potency topical corticosteroids) or standard of care (emollients, vehicle, medium potency topical corticosteroids). The study was conducted in children and adolescents (2 to 18 years of age). Hungarian cost vectors were calculated by linking severity of disease as defined by Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) to average resource use. Resource use was multiplied by drug costs and unit costs as published in official databases. RESULTS - Pimecrolimus treatment has an incremental cost of HUF 143 897 over standard care. This additional cost of care resulted in an incremental 0.05 QALY gain over the 6 months period. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was 2 863 913 HUF/QALY for the pimecrolimus therapy. CONCLUSION - Pimecrolimus is more cost-effective than many other health care interventions currently reimbursed by the Hungarian National Health Fund.","Atopic dermatitis; Cost-effectiveness; Markov model",,,,,,,,,,,"Wahn, U., Bos, J.D., Goodfield, M., Caputo, R., Papp, K., Manjra, A., Flare Reduction in Eczema with Elidel (Children) Multicenter Investigator Study Group.

AR, however, is closely associated with other disorders such as bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD). These co-morbid associations may have an effect on the inter-relation of generic and disease-specific QOL outcomes and the behaviour of this inter-relation in time. Objective: To unravel the inter-relationships between the outcome of a generic instrument (SF-36) and a disease-specific instrument (Rhinitis QOL Questionnaire (RQLQ)). Materials and methods: In the framework of a randomized clinical trial with respect to the efficacy of impermeable bedding covers in house dust mite (HDM) allergy, SF-36 and RQLQ were administered to 224 adults with AR and/or allergic asthma and/or AD at baseline and after 12 months of intervention. Regression analysis and canonical correlation were used to estimate overlap. Results: Overlap between SF-36 and RQLQ domains in terms of explained variance ranged from 6% to 56%. Canonical correlation yielded low coefficients (0.16-0.27). Moreover, both SF-36 and RQLQ scores did not change significantly during the intervention. Conclusion: In patients with HDM allergy characterized by co-morbid associations, SF-36 and RQLQ cover different aspects in QOL. It is advocated to use both simultaneously in performing QOL studies.","Allergy; Canonical correlation; Redundancy analysis; Rhinitis; RQLQ; SF-36","adolescent; adult; allergic asthma; allergic rhinitis; article; atopic dermatitis; canonical analysis; child; clinical trial; comorbidity; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; disease association; double blind procedure; female; house dust allergy; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; priority journal; quality of life; questionnaire; regression analysis; Rhinitis QOL questionnaire; sf 36 questionnaire; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; Double-Blind Method; Dust; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial",,"Dust",,,,,,,,"Juniper, E.F., Guyatt, G.H., Development and testing of a new measure of health status for clinical trials in rhinoconjunctivitis (1991) Clin Exp Allergy, 21, pp. 77-83; Juniper, E.F., Guyatt, G.H., Epstein, R.S., Ferrie, P.J., Jaeschke, R., Miller, T.K., Evaluation of impairment of health related quality of life in asthma: Development of a questionnaire for use in clinical trials (1992) Thorax, 47, pp. 76-83; Van Der Molen, T., Postma, D.S., Schreurs, A.J., Bosveld, H.E., Sears, M.R., Meyboom De Jong, B., Discriminative aspects of two generic and two asthma-specific instruments: Relation with symptoms, bronchodilator use and lung function in patients with mild asthma (1997) Qual Life Res, 6, pp. 353-361; Bousquet, J., Knani, J., Dhivert, H., Quality of life in asthma.

Exposure to allergens or bacterial superantigens triggers T and dendritic cell (DC) recruitment and induces atopic skin inflammation. In this study, we report that among all known chemokines CCL18/DC-CK1/PARC represents the most highly expressed ligand in atopic dermatitis. Moreover, CCL18 expression is associated with an atopic dermatitis phenotype when compared with other chronic inflammatory skin diseases. DCs either dispersed within the dermis or clustering at sites showing perivascular infiltrates are abundant sources of CCL18. In vitro, microbial products including LPS, peptidoglycan, and mannan, as well as the T cell-derived activation signal CD40L, induced CCL18 in monocytes. In contrast to monocytes, monocyte-derived, interstitial-type, and Langerhans-type DCs showed a constitutive and abundant expression of CCL18. In comparison to Langerhans cells, interstitial-type DCs produced higher constitutive levels of CCL18. In vivo, topical exposure to the relevant allergen or the superantigen staphytococcal enterotoxin B, resulted in a significant induction of CCL18 in atopic dermatitis patients. Furthermore, in nonatopic NiSO4-sensitized individuals, only relevant allergen but not irritant exposure resulted in the induction of CCL18. Taken together, findings of the present study demonstrate that CCL18 is associated with an atopy/allergy skin phenotype, and is expressed at the interface between the environment and the host by cells constantly screening foreign Ags. Its regulation by allergen exposure and microbial products suggests an important role for CCL18 in the initiation and amplification of atopic skin inflammation.",,"allergen; bacterial antigen; bacterium lipopolysaccharide; beta chemokine; cc chemokine ligand 18; CD40 ligand; chemokine; chemokine CCL18; dc ck protein; irritant agent; ligand; mannan; peptidoglycan; protein; protein ParC; Staphylococcus enterotoxin B; staphylococcus protein A; superantigen; unclassified drug; allergy; article; atopic dermatitis; atopy; cell infiltration; cell isolation; controlled study; dendritic cell; dermis; environmental exposure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; Langerhans cell; monocyte; phenotype; prevalence; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; skin allergy; skin inflammation; T lymphocyte activation",,"CD40 ligand, 226713-27-5; mannan, 51395-96-1, 9036-88-8; peptidoglycan, 9047-10-3; protein, 67254-75-5; Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, 39424-53-8; staphylococcus protein A, 37380-84-0",,,,,,,,"Leung, D.Y., Boguniewicz, M., Howell, M.D., Nomura, I., Hamid, Q.A., New insights into atopic dermatitis (2004) J.

Objective: The aim of the present study was to translate and validate one of the most frequently used and established skin disease-specific HRQOL questionnaires originally developed in English for the German language area: the Skindex-29. Methods: 295 in-patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis completed the German translation of the Skindex as well as a number of additional skin disease-specific questionnaires. Data from 2 subsamples were analysed separately to test for the robustness of results. Results: Results from principal component analyses supported the scale structure of the original Skindex. Internal consistency coefficients were high for all scales. Further analyses supported the convergent validity of the German adaptation of the Skindex-29 as well as its sensitivity to change. Conclusion: The study provides evidence for the validity and reliability of the Skindex-29. Copyright © 2004 S.

Maastricht, Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands","Objective: The hygiene hypothesis suggests that the protective 'siblings effect' against atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma and hay fever is a result of recurrent infections during early childhood. A recent study and review have indicated that this protective effect may already arise in utero. Lower n-3 essential fatty acid (EFA) status is associated with increased parity, and EFA status has also been related to atopy. The present study confirms the negative association between parity and neonatal immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and further unravel the role of perinatal EFA status. Methodology: In a prospective cohort study in 184 atopic mothers and their neonates, we simultaneously measured serum total IgE and EFA levels in plasma phospholipids, both in the mother at 34-36 weeks of gestation and in the neonate at the age of 1 week. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of parity on maternal and neonatal IgE and EFA status, and the independent effects of parity and EFA status on IgE, controlling for confounding factors such as maternal age and birth season. Results: Parity was associated with lower neonatal IgE level (P < 0.01), as well as with lower docosahexanoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) status of the mother (P = 0.01) but not of the neonate (P > 0.69). In the multivariate analysis, higher parity, higher maternal IgE, lower maternal age and birth in the first 3 months of the year were independently associated with neonatal IgE level. No association was detected between maternal or neonatal EFA status and neonatal IgE. Conclusions: As neonatal total serum IgE is predictive of later atopy, our results support the hypothesis that the sibling effect in atopy is already being programmed in utero. Our data also confirm earlier findings that DHA status is lower in multiparous women, but this did not confound the relation between parity and neonatal IgE.","Atopic dermatitis; Atopy; Essential; Fatty acids","docosahexaenoic acid; essential fatty acid; immunoglobulin E; phospholipid derivative; atopy; birth; blood analysis; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease association; factorial analysis; health status; hemoconcentration; human; immunoglobulin blood level; infant; major clinical study; maternal age; mother; multivariate analysis; newborn; parity; perinatal period; priority journal; prospective study; review; season; Fatty Acids, Essential; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunoglobulin E; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Age; Parity; Seasons",,"docosahexaenoic acid, 25167-62-8, 32839-18-2; essential fatty acid, 11006-87-4; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Fatty Acids, Essential; Immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,,"Williams, H.C., Is the prevalence of atopic dermatitis increasing?

Cross-sectional, population-based survey. Objectives. To investigate the pattern of comorbidity with low back pain in adolescents. Summary of Background Data. Low back pain is usually dealt with as a specific and independent entity. However, the existing literature shows comorbidity to be common with low back pain, suggesting that low back pain may be part of a broader pattern of general health. The present knowledge is based on studies of adult populations; therefore, associations could be explained by work and lifestyle factors. Information in this area is lacking regarding subjects still unaffected by such factors. Methods. A questionnaire-survey about general health, including low back pain, was carried out among twins registered in the population-based Danish Twin Registry. Associations between disorders were calculated and patterns of comorbidity investigated, by means of logistic regression and a finite mixture model. Finally a twin-control study was conducted. Results. A total of 9,567 individuals, 12 to 22 years of age, responded to the questionnaire. Positive associations between low back pain and asthma and headache/migraine were demonstrated, mainly because of study participants with several disorders. No association between low back pain and atopic dermatitis/hay fever was found. The presence of two other disorders increased the probability of low back pain considerably more than the presence of only one other disorder. The finite mixture model indicated that the probability of belonging to a frail subgroup decreased from 60% at age 13 to 25% at age 21, and in the frail subgroups nearly all report low back pain and headache in the older ages. Furthermore, increasing duration of low back pain increased the likelihood of having other disorders. Results from the twin-control study were similar. Conclusion. Young people are more likely to suffer from asthma and headache, but not from atopic dermatitis/hay fever, if they have low back pain. All of the investigated disorders cluster in some individuals. A model of common origin for these seemingly independent disorders should be considered.","Asthma; Atopic dermatitis; Comorbidity; Disease susceptibility; Hay fever; Headache; Low back pain","adolescent; adult; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child; comorbidity; disease association; female; hay fever; headache; health survey; human; lifestyle; logistic regression analysis; low back pain; major clinical study; male; migraine; priority journal; questionnaire; twins; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Asthma; Child; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Denmark; Diabetes Mellitus; Diseases in Twins; Female; Headache; Health Surveys; Humans; Hypersensitivity, Immediate; Low Back Pain; Male; Prevalence; Questionnaires; Twins, Monozygotic",,,,,,,,,,"Balagué, F., Troussier, B., Salminen, J.J., Non-specific low back pain in children and adolescents: Risk factors (1999) Eur Spine J, 8, pp. 429-438; Christie, G.L., Some socio-cultural and psychological aspects of infertility (1998) Hum Reprod, 13, pp. 232-241; Colhoun, H.M., Hemingway, H., Poulter, N.R., Socio-economic status and blood pressure: An overview analysis (1998) J Hum Hypertens, 12, pp. 91-110; Nixon Speechley, K., Maunsell, E., Desmeules, M., Mutual concurrent validity of the child health questionnaire and the health utilities index: An exploratory analysis using survivors of childhood cancer (1999) Int J Cancer Suppl, 12, pp. 95-105; Ahern, D.K., Iezzi, A., Hursey, K., The co-occurrence of chronic low back pain and headache: Prevalence, neuroticism, and treatment outcome (1988) Clin J Pain, 4, pp. 27-31; Duckro, P.N., Schultz, K.T., Chibnall, J.T., Migraine as a sequel to chronic low back pain (1994) Headache, 34, pp. 279-281; Gyntelberg, F., One year incidence of low back pain among male residents of Copenhagen aged 40-49 (1974) Dan Med Bull, 21, pp. 30-36; Battié, M.C., Bigos, S.J., Fischer, L.D., A prospective study of the role of cardiovascular risk factors and fitness in industrial back pain complaints (1989) Spine, 14, pp. 141-147; Heliövaara, M., Mäkelä, M., Knekt, P., Determinants of sciatica and low-back pain (1991) Spine, 16, pp. 608-614; Kauppila, L.I., McAlindon, T., Evans, S., Disc degeneration/back pain and calcification of the abdominal aorta: A 25-year follow-up study in Framingham (1997) Spine, 22, pp. 1642-1649; Kauppila, L.I., Penttilä, A., Karhunen, P.J., Lumbar disc degeneration and atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta (1994) Spine, 19, pp. 923-929; Penttinen, J., Back pain and risk of fatal ischaemic heart disease: 13 year follow-up of Finnish farmers (1994) Br Med J, 309, pp. 1267-1268; Svensson, H., Vedin, A., Wilhelmsson, C., Low-back pain in relation to other diseases and cardiovascular risk factors (1983) Spine, 8, pp. 277-285; Vogt, M.T., Nevitt, M.C., Cauley, J.A., Back problems and atherosclerosis: The study of osteoporotic fractures (1997) Spine, 22, pp. 2741-2747; Wright, D., Barrow, S., Fisher, A.D., Influence of physical and behavioural factors on consultations for back pain (1995) Br J Rheumatol, 34, pp. 156-161; Åstrand, N.E., Medical, psychological, and social factors associated with back abnormalities and self reported back pain: A cross-sectional study of male employees in a Swedish pulp and paper industry (1987) Br J Ind Med, 44, pp. 327-336; Côté, P., Cassidy, D., Carroll, L., The factors associated with neck pain and its related disability in the Saskatchewan population (2000) Spine, 25, pp. 1109-1117; Østesen, M., Schei, B., Sociodemographic characteristics and gynecological disease in 40-42 year old women reporting musculoskeletal disease (1997) Scand J Rheumatol, 26, pp. 426-434; Hurwitz, E.L., Morgenstern, H., Cross-sectional associations of asthma, hay fever, and other allergies with major depression and low-back pain among adults aged 20-39 years in the United States (1999) Am J Epidemiol, 150, pp. 1107-1116; Biering-Sørensen, F., Thomsen, C., Medical, social and occupational history as risk indicators for low-back trouble in a general population (1986) Spine, 11, pp. 720-725; Hurwitz, E.L., Morgenstern, H., Correlates of back problems and back-related disability in the United States (1997) J Clin Epidemiol, 50, pp. 669-681; Seferlis, T., Németh, G., Carlsson, A., Acute low-back-pain patients exhibit a fourfold increase in sick leave for other disorders: A case-control study (1999) J Spine Dis, 12, pp. 280-286; Thomas, E., Silman, A.J., Croft, P.R., Predicting who develops chronic low back pain in primary care: A prospective study (1999) Br Med J, 318, pp. 1662-1667; Burton, A.K., Clarker, R.D., McClune, T.D., The natural history of low back pain in adolescents (1996) Spine, 21, pp. 2323-2328; Lebouef-Yde, C., Kyvik, K.O., At what age does low back pain become a problem?

Methods: Between 1992 and 1996, each centre studied random samples of children aged 13-14 and 6-7 years (approx. 3000 per age group and centre) using standardised written and video questionnaires on symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and atopic eczema during the past 12 months. Data on long term climatic conditions in the centres were abstracted from one standardised source, and mixed linear regression models calculated to take the clustering of centres within countries into account. Results: In Western Europe (57 centres in 12 countries), the prevalence of asthma symptoms, assessed by written questionnaire, increased by 2.7% (95% CI 1.0% to 4.5%) with an increase in the estimated annual mean of indoor relative humidity of 10%. Similar associations were seen for the video questionnaire and the younger age group. Altitude and the annual variation of temperature and relative humidity outdoors were negatively associated with asthma symptoms. The prevalence of eczema symptoms correlated with latitude (positively) and mean annual outdoor temperature (negatively). Conclusions: Results suggest that climate may affect the prevalence of asthma and atopic eczema in children.",,"adolescent; allergic rhinitis; altitude; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; climate; cluster analysis;

The objective of this studey was to determine the current 1-year and lifetime asthma prevalence rates, and to identify major risk factors for adult asthma in Taiwan. Methods: A cluster sampling was conducted in 1999, where 21 clusters and 4549 adults (age ≥ 18 years) were selected randomly. Face-to-face interview were conducted with a total of 2076 adults (45.6%; men/women 987/1089) using a questionnaire designed to assess asthma and asthma-like symptoms adapted from the American Thoracic Society with minor modifications to include information about current asthma status. Results: The results showed that 50 case had a previous diagnosis of asthma and 94 had been classified as probably having asthma with intermittently audible wheezing. The lifetime prevalence rate of asthma in adults in Taipei City prevalence of asthma was 4.1%. A multiple logistic regression model showed the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of a history of maternal asthma to be 5.8 (2.77 to 12.18), that of allergic rhinitis to be 3.2 (2.03 to 5.16), that of paternal asthma to be 2.2 (0.91 to 5.21), that of older age(≥ 50 years) to be 2.0 (1.25 to 3.19), and that of smoking habit to be 1.7 (1.02 to 2.72). Conclusions: The lifetime prevalence rate of adult bronchial asthma in Taipei City was 7.8% and related to both genetic and environmental factors, which included maternal of paternal history of asthma, history of allergic rhinitis, older age (≥ 50 years), and smoking habits.","Adult; Asthma; Prevalence; Risk factors; Taiwan","adult; age; allergic rhinitis; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; cigarette smoking; cluster analysis; controlled study; disease classification; disease severity; environmental factor; family history; female; health status; heredity; human; interview; lifespan; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; medical assessment; medical society; patient selection; prevalence; questionnaire; risk factor; sampling; smoking habit; symptom; Taiwan; wheezing; adolescent; aged; asthma; genetics; middle aged; perennial rhinitis; smoking; Taiwan; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Asthma; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial; Risk Factors; Smoking; Taiwan",,,,,,,,,,"Sears, M.R., Descriptive epidemiology of asthma (1997) Lancet, 350 (SUPPL.

Patients (N = 442) with different skin disorders completed the original item pool. Principal-components analysis suggested a 6-factor solution that was largely replicated with 2 additional samples of 192 patients with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis and 165 patients with atopic dermatitis. Four of the subscales showed very good internal consistencies, retest reliabilities, and sufficient correlations with expert ratings: Social Anxiety/Avoidance, Itch-Scratch Cycle, Helplessness, and Anxious-Depressive Mood. Two short additional subscales, Impact on Quality of Life and Deficit in Active Coping, showed moderate internal consistencies, but good retest reliabilities. Correlations of the subscales with measures of depression, anxiety, and coping, and meaningful differences between dermatological subgroups support their construct validity. A treatment study showed that changes in some of the subscales correlated with changes in the severity of the skin condition.",,"acne; adaptation; adult; anxiety disorder; article; atopic dermatitis; avoidance behavior; chronic disease; contact dermatitis; coping behavior; depression; epidermolysis bullosa; factorial analysis; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; psoriasis; quality of life; questionnaire; rating scale; self report; sex difference; skin disease; vitiligo; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Chronic Disease; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Personality Inventory; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Sick Role; Skin Diseases",,,,,,,,,,"Aktan, S., Ozmen, E., Sanli, B., Psychiatric disorders in patients attending a dermatology outpatient clinic (1998) Dermatology, 97, pp. 230-234; Albus, M., Maier, W., Shera, D., Bech, P., Consistencies and discrepancies in self- and observer-rated anxiety scales (1990) European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience, 240, pp. 96-102; Becker, P., (1982) Interaktions-Angst-Fragebogen [Interaction Anxiety Questionnaire], , Weinheim, Germany: Beltz; Bernhard, J.D., (1994) Itch.

Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients are often influenced by the psychosocial consequences of their skin diseases. In order to assess these experiences reliably, the stigmatization feeling and the quality of life of these patient groups were studied. Patients/Methods. The short form of the ""Questionnaire on Experience with Skin Complaints"" (QES) was validated in a sample of 463 inpatients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. In addition, the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was ascertained. Results. The dimensions ""impairment of self-esteem and withdrawal"", ""rejection experienced"", ""concealment"", and ""composure"" of the QES could be confirmed by factor analysis. As expected, middle high correlation between the QES and the DLQI were found in both patient groups. However, the stigmatization experience and the quality of life were not significantly different in a subgroup of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients with comparable sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusions. The short form of the QES with 23 items is a valid instrument for the examination of social and psychic burdens of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients. The recording of the stigmatization feeling and of the quality of life determines different, supplementary aspects of the illness-related stress of patients with chronic skin diseases.","Atopic Dermatitis; Psoriasis; Quality of Life; Questionnaire; Stigmatization Experience","adolescent; adult; aged; article; atopic dermatitis; correlation analysis; human; major clinical study; patient attitude; psoriasis; quality of life; questionnaire; self esteem; social psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psoriasis; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Sex Factors; Stereotyping; Time Factors",,,,,,,,,,"Augustin, M., Amon, U., Bullinger, M., Gieler, U., Empfehlungen zur erfassung von lebensqualität in der dermatologie (2000) Dermatol Psychosom, 1, pp. 76-82; De Korte, J., Mombers, F.M., Sprangers, M.A., Bos, J.D., The Suitability of quality-of-life questionnaires for psoriasis research: A systematic literature review (2002) Arch Dermatol, 138, pp. 1221-1227; Finlay, A.Y., Khan, G.K., Luscombe, D.K., Salek, M.S., Validation of sickness impact profile and psoriasis disability index in psoriasis (1990) Br J Dermatol, 123, pp. 751-756; Finlay, A.Y., Khan, G.K., Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) - A simple practical measure for routine clinical use (1994) Clin Exp Dermatol, 19, pp. 210-216; Fleischer A.B., Jr., Feldman, S.R., Dekle, C.L., The SAPASI is valid and responsive to psoriasis disease severity changes in a multi-center clinical trial (1999) J Dermatol, 26, pp. 210-215; Gieler, U., Niemeier, V., Kupfer, J., Psychosomatische dermatologie in Deutschland.

UVA-induced apoptosis of T helper cells is believed to underlie the UVA phototherapy for atopic dermatitis and other T cell-mediated inflammatory skin diseases. We have evaluated the involvement of the Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) pathway in rapid UVA-induced apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells. UVA-induced apoptosis was not inhibited by pretreatment with a neutralizing anti-Fas antibody, although the same UVA treatment initiated cleavage of caspase-8 and subsequent processing of Bid and caspase-3-like proteases. Inhibition of caspase-8 by Lle-Glu (OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone completely blocked caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis in UVA-treated cells, suggesting that apoptosis was initiated by the Fas pathway. This inference was supported by demonstrating that immunoprecipitates obtained from UVA-treated cells using anti-Fas antibody contained caspase-8 and Fas-associating protein with death domain (FADD). In addition, Fas clustering in response to UVA treatment was observed by immunofluorescence microscopy. These data support a mechanism for rapid, UVA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells involving initial formation of the Fas-FADD-caspase-8 death complex in an FasL-independent manner.",,"caspase 3; caspase 8; Fas antibody; Fas antigen; FAS ligand; ketone derivative; neutralizing antibody; protein Bid; proteinase; reactive oxygen metabolite; apoptosis; article; atopic dermatitis; controlled study; enzyme degradation; enzyme inhibition; gene expression; helper cell; human; human cell; immunofluorescence microscopy; immunoprecipitation; leukemia cell; light absorption; mutagenesis; phototherapy; skin inflammation; solar radiation; ultraviolet A radiation; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Antigens, CD95; Apoptosis; Carrier Proteins; Caspase 3; Caspase 8; Caspases; Enzyme Activation; Fas Ligand Protein; Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein; HL-60 Cells; Humans; Leukemia; Membrane Glycoproteins; Signal Transduction; Ultraviolet Rays; Up-Regulation",,"caspase 3, 169592-56-7; protein Bid, 260235-79-8; proteinase, 9001-92-7; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Antigens, CD95; Carrier Proteins; CASP3 protein, human, EC 3.4.22.-; CASP8 protein, human, EC 3.4.22.-; Caspase 3, EC 3.4.22.-; Caspase 8, EC 3.4.22.-; Caspases, EC 3.4.22.-; FADD protein, human; Fas Ligand Protein; Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein; FASLG protein, human; Membrane Glycoproteins",,,"National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: R01GM030755",,,,,"Berneburg, M., Grether-Beck, S., Kurten, V., Ruzicka, T., Briviba, K., Sies, H., Krutmann, J., Singlet oxygen mediates the UVA-induced generation of the photoaging-associated mitochondrial common deletion (1999) J.

In a whole-population birth cohort study (n = 1456) we examined prevalence and characteristics of eczema amongst 10-year-old children. At this age 1373 (94%) children completed ISAAC questionnaires, 1043 (72%) skin prick testing and 953 (65%) serum inhalant IgE antibody screening. At 10 years of age prevalence of eczema ever was 41.0% and for current eczema was 13.7% (combined current itchy rash and eczema ever). Most current eczema (71.0%) began before 4 years of age, but was associated with low morbidity at 10 years. Amongst children with diagnosed eczema at 4 years of age, 56.3% had current eczema at 10 years. Atopy (positive skin test) and other allergic states were associated with current eczema (p < 0.001). Risk factor analysis for current eczema identified independent significance for atopy (p = 0.01), rhinitis (p = 0.04) and food allergy (p = 0.01) at 4 years, plus maternal asthma (p = 0.03). Diagnosed rhinitis at 4 years emerged as a significant predictor of persistent disease. Eczema is not simply a transient infantile condition but a common problem at 10 years of age, often reflecting persistent disease from early childhood. Inherited predisposition towards atopy is the predominant risk factor for this state.","Atopic eczema; Atopy; Natural history; Prevalence; Risk factors","immunoglobulin E; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; cohort analysis; conference paper; disease course; eczema; food allergy; genetic susceptibility; human; major clinical study; mother child relation; prevalence; priority journal; rhinitis; risk assessment; risk factor; Child; Eczema; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunoglobulin E; Logistic Models; Male; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Risk Factors",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,,"Worldwide variation in prevalence of symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and atopic eczema (1998) Lancet, 351, pp. 1225-1232; Kjellman, N.M., Nilsson, L., From food allergy and atopic dermatitis to respiratory allergy (1998) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 9 (SUPPL. 11), pp. 13-17; Determinants of total and specific IgE in infants with atopic dermatitis (1997) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 8, pp. 177-184; Bergmann, R.L., Edenharmer, G., Bergmann, K.E., Atopic dermatitis in early infancy predicts allergic airways disease at 5 years (1998) Clin Exp Allergy, 28, pp. 965-970; Austin, J.B., Kaur, B., Anderson, H.R., Hay fever, eczema, and wheeze: A nationwide UK study (ISAAC, international study of asthma and allergies in childhood) (1999) Arch Dis Child, 81, pp. 225-230; Shamssain, M.H., Shamsian, N., Prevalence severity of asthma, rhinitis, and atopic eczema: The north east study (1999) Arch Dis Child, 81, pp. 313-317; Arshad, S.H., Development of allergic disease in children (1997) Clin Exp Allergy, 27, pp. 1231-1233; Arshad, S.H., Hide, D.W., Effect of environmental factors on the development of allergic disorders in infancy (1992) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 90, pp. 235-241; Arshad, S.H., Stevens, M., Hide, D.W., The effect of genetic and environmental factors on the prevalence of allergic disorders at the age of two years (1993) Clin Exp Allergy, 23, pp. 504-511; Tariq, S.M., Matthews, S.M., Hakim, E.A., Stevens, M., Arshad, S.H., Hide, D.W., The prevalence of and risk factors for atopy in early childhood: A whole population birth cohort study (1998) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 101, pp. 587-593; Kulig, M., Bergmann, R., Wahn, U., Guggenmossholzmann, I., Long-lasting sensitization to food during the first two years precedes allergic airways disease (1998) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 9, pp. 61-67; Burr, M.L., Merrett, T.G., Dunstan, F.D.J., Maguire, M.J., The development of allergy in high-risk children (1997) Clin Exp Allergy, 27, pp. 1247-1253; Kjellmann, B., Hattevig, G., Allergy in early and late onset of atopic dermatitis (1994) Acta Paediatr, 83, pp. 229-231; Linna, O., Kokkonen, J., Lahtela, P., Tammela, O., Ten-year prognosis for generalised eczema (1992) Acta Paediatr, 81, pp. 1013-1016; Cogswell, J.J., Influence of maternal atopy on atopy in the offspring (2000) Clin Exp Allergy, 30, pp. 1-3; Sarafino, E.P., Connections among parent and child atopic illnesses (2000) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 11, pp. 80-86","Kurukulaaratchy, R.; David Hide Asthma/Allerg.

Serological methods have been tried but are not currently recommended for diagnosis of suspected food allergy in dogs. The aim of this study was to investigate humoral immune responses to food antigens in dogs. Serum IgG and IgE antibodies specific for food antigens were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using polyclonal anti-dog IgG and IgE reagents. Antigens tested were beef, chicken, pork, lamb, chicken, turkey, white fish, whole egg, wheat, soybean, barley, rice, maize corn, potato, yeast and cow's milk. Three groups were examined: normal dogs, dogs with atopic dermatitis (AD); and dogs with one of four types of gastrointestinal (GI) disease: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), food-responsive disease, and infectious diarrhoea. Statistically significant differences in food-specific antibodies were not detected between the GI subgroups. There were statistically significant differences in the IgE concentration between the normal dogs, and dogs with atopic or GI disease, for all of the antigens tested. There were statistically significant differences in the average IgG concentrations between the normal dogs, and dogs with atopic or GI disease, for all of the antigens tested, except egg and yeast. The relationship of antigen responses for pooled data was analysed using principle component analysis and cluster plots. Some clustering of variables was apparent for both IgE and IgG. For example, all dogs (normal and diseased) made a similar IgG antibody response to chicken and turkey. Compared with other groups, atopic dogs had more food allergen-specific IgE and this would be consistent with a Th2 humoral response to food antigens. Dogs with GI disease had more food allergen-specific IgG compared with the other groups. This may reflect increased antigen exposure due to increased mucosal permeability which is a recognised feature of canine intestinal disease. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Parents of two clinical samples were asked to rate the quality of life of their children using the German version of the CHQ. Item internal consistency (item-scale correlation) and internal consistency of scales were tested; quartiles and factor analysis were conducted. The results of the German clinical samples were compared with US clinical samples (t-test). The two clinical German sub-groups were compared using multivariate analysis (MANOVA). The psychometric testing of the CHQ showed good results. Internal consistency of the hypothesized scales were all higher than 0.70. The results of the factor analysis confirmed the results of the US norm sample: As expected, the subscales loaded on two factors explaining 57.4% of the total variance.

Patients and Methods: 100 patients with atopic dermatitis who received only standard medical treatment participated in the study. The original questionnaire was translated by a German-Japanese bilingual researcher and a native German speaker. Retranslation was made after definitions and fluency had been checked by unaware dermatologists. Results: The Japanese version of the KFJ showed good psychometric qualities similar to the original. This was indicated by the results of factor analysis and internal consistency (catastrophizing scale: α = 0.89; coping scale: α = 0.80). Concurrent validity was supported by state anxiety and depression having a positive correlation only with the catastrophizing scale (r = 0.41 and 0.44 respectively). Supernatural and internal locus of control also had a positive correlation with the catastrophizing scale. Predictive validity was confirmed in that patients with severe skin lesions scored high on the catastrophizing scale. Discussion: These findings support the utility of the Japanese version of the KFJ, which has the advantage of measuring precisely the outcome of psychological interventions focusing on coping with itch in atopic dermatitis patients.","Atopic dermatitis;

Design: Retrospective epidemiologic study. Setting: Six primary care teaching practices affiliated with a university. Patients: Forty-one patients with pityriasis rosea, 564 patients with atopic dermatitis (negative control condition), and 35 patients with scabies (positive control condition). Methods: We retrieved all records of patients with pityriasis rosea, atopic dermatitis, or scabies diagnosed in 3 years. We analyzed temporal clustering by a method based on a regression model. Results: The monthly incidence of pityriasis rosea is negatively but insignificantly correlated with mean air temperature (γs=-0.41, P=.19) and mean total rainfall (γs=-0.34, P=.27). Three statistically significant clusters with 7, 6, and 7 cases were identified (P=.03), occurring in the second coldest month in the year (February), the second hottest month (July), and a temperate month (April), respectively. For atopic dermatitis (negative control condition), the nonclustering regression model was selected by Akaike information criteria. For scabies (positive control condition), 1 cluster of 20 cases was detected (P=.03). Conclusions: Significant temporal clustering independent of seasonal variation occurred in our series of patients with pityriasis rosea.

Objective: We sought to compare cost-effectiveness of high-potency topical corticosteroids (HPTCs) and tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis for patients who are not responsive to or not well controlled with mid-potency topical corticosteroids. Methods: A Markov model represented the cyclic nature of atopic dermatitis. Clinical outcomes were derived from published literature. ""Efficacy"" was defined as disease-controlled days on which patients experienced a greater than 75% improvement in their disease. Resource use and changes in management were on the basis of opinions of a physician panel; secondary treatment was an oral antibiotic with topical corticosteroids. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for all variables. Results: The model was sensitive to duration of continuous treatment with HPTCs. HPTCs, when limited to 2-week treatment cycles, were associated with the highest total costs ($1682 per year) and the least efficacy (185 disease-controlled days). HPTCs in 4-week treatment intervals and tacrolimus ointment were similar in total costs and efficacy ($1317 vs $1323 for 194 vs 190 disease-controlled days, respectively). Although primary drug costs were higher for patients treated with tacrolimus ointment, patients treated with regimens of HPTCs incurred higher secondary drug costs. Conclusion: In the base case analyses, tacrolimus ointment was more cost-effective than HPTCs administered in 2-week treatment cycles, and similar in cost-effectiveness to 4-week cycles of HPTCs.",,"amcinonide; betamethasone; betamethasone dipropionate; clobetasol; clobetasol propionate; corticosteroid; desoximetasone; diflorasone; diflorasone diacetate; fluocinonide; halcinonide; mometasone furoate; tacrolimus; ulobetasol propionate; adult; article; atopic dermatitis; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; cost effectiveness analysis; disease severity; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug potency; health care cost; human; major clinical study; medical fee; ointment; prescription; priority journal; relapse; topical treatment; treatment outcome",,"amcinonide, 51022-69-6; betamethasone, 378-44-9; betamethasone dipropionate, 5593-20-4; clobetasol, 25122-41-2; clobetasol propionate, 25122-46-7; desoximetasone, 382-67-2; diflorasone, 2557-49-5; diflorasone diacetate, 33564-31-7; fluocinonide, 356-12-7; halcinonide, 3093-35-4; mometasone furoate, 83919-23-7, 105102-22-5; tacrolimus, 104987-11-3; ulobetasol propionate, 66852-54-8","cyclocort; diprolene; diprosone; elocon; halog; lidex; psorcon; tacrolimus; temovate; topicort; ultravate",,,"Supported by Fujisawa Healthcare Inc.","Disclosure: All physician authors were compensated for their time serving on the advisory board for this work.

NCA was observed in 15.5% patients. Female sex was the strongest risk factor (prevalence ratio 3.74, 95% CI: 3.51-3.98). Risk increased monotonically and significantly with decreasing age. Atopic dermatitis was not a risk factor. The year of patch test had no influence on NCA risk. Significant variation of risk between occupations was observed. In conclusion, our multifactorial analysis was able to quantify the impact of established risk factors and additionally address other, e.g. occupational, factors yet unidentified. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2003.","CAS 10101-91-0; Clinical epidemiology; Contact allergy; Nickel sulfate","nickel; adult; article; atopic dermatitis; Austria; contact allergy; controlled study; factorial analysis; female; gender; Germany; human; major clinical study; male; occupational exposure; patch test; Poisson distribution; prevalence; regression analysis; risk factor; Adult; Allergens; Austria; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Allergic Contact; Dermatitis, Occupational; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nickel; Patch Tests; Prevalence; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Sex Factors",,"nickel, 7440-02-0; Allergens; Nickel, 7440-02-0",,,,,,,,"Schäfer, T., Böhler, E., Ruhdorfer, S., Epidemiology of contact allergy in adults (2001) Allergy, 56, pp. 1192-1196; Schnuch, A., Lehmacher, W., Epidemiologische überwachung des kontaktekzems - Darstellung des projektes 'Informationsverbund Dermatologischer Kliniken' (IVDK) in anlehnung an die 'Guidelines for Evaluating Surveillance Systems' des Center of Disease Control (CDC) (1992) Derm Beruf Umwelt, 40, pp. 177-189; Uter, W., Schnuch, A., Geier, J., Frosch, P.J., The epidemiology of contact dermatitis.

Unfortunately, head-to-head studies have not been conducted to allow comparisons in treatment efficacy and cost-effectiveness. The study aims to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream as monotherapy for the treatment of AD patients with moderate disease, who are not responsive to or not well-controlled with topical corticosteroids. In the absence of head-to-head comparative data, relative treatment efficacy was estimated based on existing outcomes, which were reported in the published literature and data from clinical trials. Comparisons were made between Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores and converted to disease-controlled days (DCDs) on treatment. Other assumptions about resource utilization, changes in management and patient outcomes were based on opinions of a physician panel and from previously published reports. Medical resources costs were derived from fee schedules and product average wholesale prices (AWPs). A Markov model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness ratios for each treatment. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for key variables to assess their impact on the results. Study designs and efficacy endpoints differed between tacrolimus and pimecrolimus clinical studies. In tacrolimus studies, a quantitative physician global assessment was performed, which tracked percentage improvement relative to baseline. In contrast, pimecrolimus studies relied on investigator global assessments scored on a Likert scale. Studies of both agents used the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). A comparison of EASI scores for tacrolimus and pimecrolimus found that pimecrolimus was approximately 60% as efficacious as tacrolimus after 2 to 4 weeks of treatment. Based on these efficacy rates, average cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated at $7. 34 per DCD for tacrolimus and $11.34 per DCD for pimecrolimus. Sensitivity analyses found that pimecrolimus would only be cost-effective if its efficacy approached 90% of tacrolimus efficacy or if the costs of the products were significantly different than current AWPs. Although head-to-head comparative studies have not been completed to date, there are likely to be differences in efficacy between topical immunomodulators. Based on published data, we estimate that the efficacy of pimecrolimus to be 60% of the efficacy of tacrolimus and therefore, tacrolimus to be more cost-effective for the treatment of moderate AD. Sensitivity analyses revealed that pimecrolimus cream would need to be 90% as efficacious as tacrolimus ointment in order to be cost-effective in this patient population.Results:A comparison of change in EASI scores over the first 4 weeks of treatment showed that relative to vehicle controls, Tac reduced EASI scores significantly more than Elidel. At week 2, Elidel EASI differences were 65% compared to Tac (-4.4 versus -6.8); at week 4, EASI differences were 61% (-5.5 versus -9.0). The efficacy of Tac (75% improvement rates) was found to be 36% at week 2 and 52% at week 4. Using the relative EASI scores for both agents, the imputed efficacy rates for Elidel were calculated to be 23% at week 2, and 32% at week 4. Tac patients achieved greater disease control compared to Elidel patients (53% versus 39%) and spent less time on primary therapy (42% versus 54%). Total 1-year costs were lower for patients receiving Tac than for those receiving Elidel ($1,393 versus $1,550, respectively). Primary drug costs were higher for Tac due to differences between average wholesale prices (Tac: $797 versus Elidel: $786). However, Elidel patients incurred greater costs on secondary treatment (Elidel: $236 versus Tac: $162), as well as higher physicians' costs (Elidel: $529 versus Tac: $434). Elidel patients incurred higher costs because they did not achieve comparable rates of disease control, and more Elidel patients were likely to require continuous physician management and ended up on secondary therapy. Total efficacy as measured by DCDs was significantly higher for Tac (190 DCDs) compared to Elidel (137 DCDs). The average cost-effectiveness ratio of Tac was $7.34 per DCD compared to $11.34 per DCD for Elidel. Higher efficacy rates for Elidel yielded better cost-effectiveness ratios. A sensitivity analysis of the efficacy of Elidel relative to Tac found that Elidel would be cost-effective if its efficacy approached 90% of that of Tac.Indications:403 patients with atopic dermatitis.Patients:754 patients, aged 2-17 years. Elidel group: n=403, aged 2-17 years. Tac group: n=351, aged 2-15 years.TypeofStudy:The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus (Tac) ointment and Elidel cream as monotherapy for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients with moderate disease, who are not responsive to or not well-controlled with topical corticosteroids was evaluated. Randomized, double-blind, vehicle- controlled study.DosageDuration:Dosage not stated (as cream). Duration: 6 weeks blinded followed by 20 weeks open label.AdverseEffects:No adverse events were mentioned.AuthorsConclusions:A review of existing studies indicates that tacrolimus ointment may be considered to be more potent than pimecrolimus cream for the treatment of moderate AD. Sensitivity analyses revealed that pimecrolimus cream would need to be 90% as efficacious as tacrolimus ointment in order to be cost-effective in this patient population. This study provides a framework to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of these two agents in light of assumptions made about relative cost and efficacy.FreeText:This study defined treatment success as disease-controlled days (DCD). DCDs represented days in which patients did not require primary prescription topical therapy. Comparisons were made between Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores and converted to DCDs on treatment. To compare the relative efficacy of Tac and Elidel, the following calculations were made to impute the disease control rate for Elidel: (1) For Elidel, data that compared EASI scores of Elidel compared to vehicle in a pediatric population was utilized. (2) For Tac, the mean change in EASI scores during the first month treatment was abstracted for clinical study reports in pediatric patients for consistency. These values were compared to EASI scores for the vehicle group and differences between EASI scores were calculated. The ratio of Elidel EASI scores compared with vehicle, relative to Tac EASI scores compared with vehicle, was applied to the efficacy rate of Tac to estimate the efficacy rate for Elidel. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the third-party payer perspective over 52 weeks. Published fee schedules and prices were utilized to standardize all health care cost estimates, adjusted to the 2002 value of the US dollar. Cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated using a Markov model to represent the cyclical, recursive nature of AD. The base case Markov analysis was performed using initial data inputs from a literature review and physician panel opinion. Subsequently, sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of changing certain variables in the model. The model software utilized was DATA, version 3.5 (Treeage Software; Williamstown, MA). Both treatment groups incorporated three alternative Markov states: Primary treatment in which patients were treated either with Tac or Elidel. Secondary treatment in which patients who discontinued primary therapy could be treated with second-line therapies for 4 weeks at a time. Disease-controlled, prescription-free treatment in which the disease was well- controlled and was not actively treated with prescription pharmaceuticals for 4 weeks at a time. After every 2 weeks of primary treatment, if patients experienced disease control, they transitioned to a disease-controlled, prescription-free state. If they did not achieve disease control after 4 consecutive weeks, they could have transitioned to secondary therapy (defined as midpotency steroids and antibiotics) or could have continued on primary therapy. Secondary therapy is regarded as maintenance therapy, with no patients achieving disease control. Cost of treatment analysis focused on prescription drug and physician costs. Primary treatment costs were based on published average wholesale prices (AWP) as of September 2002. Resource utilization and changes in management were based on the opinions of the physician authors and from previously published reports. Treatment success was defined as disease control as defined in previous studies, whereby patients showed a greater than 75% improvement on baseline disease, based on physician global assessment. Success rates for Elidel were estimated based on comparisons of EASI scores described above. Other transition probabilities included efficacy rates for secondary therapy (0% after 4 weeks of treatment), and relapse rates following treatment success (50% after 4 weeks), which were determined solely by the physician panel. Relapse rate following the disease-controlled, prescription-free state was set at 50% after 4 weeks, with half of all patients continuing to be controlled while the other half were re-treated with the primary therapy. Variations in relapse rates were subjected to sensitivity analyses. The model assumed that both Tac and Elidel patients used the same number of grams per day (equivalent to 17.5 g/week). Furthermore, the model evaluated treatments, costs and outcomes over 52 weeks.","Atopic dermatitis; Cost-effectiveness; Topical immunomodulators","corticosteroid; immunomodulating agent; pimecrolimus;

R., Minsk, Belarus","Background: Opinions and recommendations about the optimal duration of exclusive breastfeeding have been strongly divided, but few published studies have provided direct evidence on the relative risks and benefits of different breastfeeding durations in recipient infants. Objective: We examined the effects on infant growth and health of 3 compared with 6 mo of exclusive breastfeeding. Design: We conducted an observational cohort study nested within a large randomized trial in Belarus by comparing 2862 infants exclusively breastfed for 3 mo (with continued mixed breastfeeding through ≥6 mo) with 621 infants who were exclusively breastfed for ≥6 mo. Regression to the mean, within-cluster correlation, and cluster- and individual-level confounding variables were accounted for by using multilevel regression analyses. Results: From 3 to 6 mo, weight gain was slightly greater in the 3-mo group [difference: 29 g/mo (95% CI: 13, 45 g/mo)], as was length gain [difference: 1.1 mm (0.5, 1.6 mm)], but the 6-mo group had a faster length gain from 9 to 12 mo [difference: 0.9 mm/mo (0.3, 1.5 mm/mo)] and a larger head circumference at 12 mo [difference: 0.19 cm (0.07, 0.31 cm)]. A significant reduction in the incidence density of gastrointestinal infection was observed during the period from 3 to 6 mo in the 6-mo group [adjusted incidence density ratio: 0.35 (0.13, 0.96)], but no significant differences in risk of respiratory infectious outcomes or atopic eczema were apparent. Conclusions: Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 mo is associated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal infection and no demonstrable adverse health effects in the first year of life.","Atopic eczema; Breastfeeding; Gastrointestinal infection; Growth; Respiratory infection","article; atopic dermatitis; body height; bottle feeding; breast feeding; child growth; child health; clinical trial; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; correlation analysis; gastrointestinal infection; growth curve; head circumference; human; infant; infection prevention; infection risk; linear regression analysis; multiple regression; normal human; randomized controlled trial; statistical analysis; weight gain; adult; educational status; female; gastrointestinal disease; growth; incidence; male; respiratory tract infection; time; weight gain; Adult; Breast Feeding; Cohort Studies; Educational Status; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Growth; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Respiratory Tract Infections; Time Factors; Weight Gain",,,,,,,,,,"Rowland, M., Barrell, R., Whitehead, R., Bacterial contamination in traditional Gambian weaning foods (1978) Lancet, 1, pp. 136-138; Rowland, M., The weanling's dilemma: Are we making progress?

Instruments for qualitative registration of these central nervous factors and evaluation of therapeutic measures are still missing. We analyzed in detail the subjective itch sensation in 108 patients with acute atopic eczema with a new questionnaire developed in analogy to the McGill pain questionnaire. The descriptors with the highest load in atopic itch and the most frequent reaction patterns in atopic eczema patients were identified. Itch intensity (mean VAS 62%) and eczema severity (SCORAD mean 41 points) showed a different frequency distribution pattern with a correlation of r = 0.33 (p < 0.05). Principal component analysis of the itch questionnaire data was performed and compared with the standardized SCORAD severity index for the patients with atopic eczema. Three main factors of atopic itch explained 58% of the total variance: (1) 'suffering' (correlation with SCORAD, r = 0.6); (2) 'phasic intensity' (correlation with SCORAD, r = 0.4), and (3) 'ecstatic' component (associated with certain active reaction patterns). In conclusion, the complete description of itch has to consider different factors, which may be described on a more general level by three main components. Two of these are correlated with objective criteria of disease activity. Copyright © 2001 S.

Design: A cross-sectional skin survey using a selected cluster sample of the various centers throughout Victoria. Setting: The study population included Victorian children attending child-care centers, preschools, and Maternal and Child Health Centres, with the reference population being Australian children aged 5 years and younger. Participants: Of 1634 potential participants, 1116 children (68.3%) were examined. Intervention: A dermatologist performed a total skin examination, including head and neck, limbs, and trunk, on all children. The diaper area was examined in children younger than 12 months. Main Outcome Measure: All parents were administered a questionnaire to elicit demographic information, history of skin conditions, and family history of skin problems or related diseases. The examiner recorded the presence, site, and severity of atopic dermatitis for calculation of age- and sex-specific prevalence rates. Results: The age- and sex-adjusted point prevalence was 30.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.0%-33.5%). Most children (63.7%) were classified as having minimal or mild disease. Only 5.8% of children with atopic dermatitis did not have face or flexural involvement. Of the 237 children with atopic dermatitis and information available, 209 used 1 or more products to treat their condition. Conclusions: Atopic dermatitis is common, decreasing in prevalence after the first 3 years of life. Most children have mild disease requiring little if any treatment, and much could be prevented with simple measures. Educational programs directed at those caring for preschool-age children that provide information on simple preventive measures, where practical, and sources of advice for treatment, if necessary, could substantially reduce the morbidity of this condition in predisposed children.",,"article; atopic dermatitis; Australia; clinical trial; cluster analysis; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; disease predisposition; disease severity; female; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; observer variation; patient care; patient education; preschool child; prevalence; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; reliability; skin disease; Child Day Care Centers; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Prevalence; Victoria",,,,,,,,,,"Fergusson, D.M., Dimond, M.E., Shannon, F.T., Morbidity during the preschool years (1984) J Australas Paediatr, 20, pp. 281-287; Hogan, P.A., Common skin, hair and nail problems during the first six months of life (1995) Aust Fam Physician, 24, pp. 1830-1841; Dickson, J., Yue, P., A study of the incidence of neonatal dermatoses (1979) Australas J Dermatol, 20, pp. 78-81; Rohr, J.B., The skin of the newborn (1975) Australas J Dermatol, 16, pp. 118-120; Rivers, J.K., Frederiksen, P.C., Dibdin, C., A prevalence survey of dermatoses in the Australian neonate (1990) J Am Acad Dermatol, 23, pp. 77-81; Mar, A., Marks, R., The descriptive epidemiology of atopic dermatitis in the community (1999) Australas J Dermatol, 40, pp. 73-78; Williams, H.C., Is the prevalence of atopic dermatitis increasing?

No systematic study exploring factors associated with adherence to treatment advice on atopic dermatitis has been carried out to date. This study seeks to generate hypotheses regarding the relationship between a range of psychosocial factors and adherence to treatment advice on atopic dermatitis. An anonymous self-completed questionnaire containing adherence items, psychosocial items, some demographic items, and attitudes to steroid use was given to 258 mothers of atopic dermatitis follow-up patients who attended the National Children's Hospital, Tokyo. Responses from 205 families (80%) with complete data were then analyzed to explore the correlation between each factor and to build a structure equation model. The strongest predictor of adherence to skin-care treatment was a good doctor-patient (mother) relationship, followed by the severity of the disease as perceived by the mother. Surprisingly, the mother's anxiety about using topical steroids had no significant influence on reported use of topical steroids nor on adherence to skin-care treatment. This may have been overcome by the well-established doctor-patient (mother) relationship. Maternal personality, husband's cooperation, and social support were indirectly correlated with adherence via the doctor-patient relationship. Maternal self-efficacy of treatment was strengthened by good doctor-patient (mother) relationship.","Compliance; Doctor-patient relations; Factor analysis; Phobia; Steroid","steroid; adolescent; adult; anxiety; article; atopic dermatitis; child; childhood disease; controlled study; demography; disease severity; doctor patient relation; drug use; female; follow up; human; infant; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; maternal behavior; paternal behavior; patient compliance; priority journal; questionnaire; self concept; skin care; social psychology; social support",,,,,"Pfizer Health Research Foundation","The research reported in this study was supported by Grant 97C042 from Pfizer Health Research Foundation.

Gender, age, disease category (AU or AD) and serum IgE value of the patients were compared with AsIgE. Univariate analysis showed that there was significant correlation between age and AsIgE, and between serum IgE and AsIgE. Serum IgE was significantly higher in AD than in AU. Age was significantly higher in AU than in AD. AsIgE was positive value in 26 cases (31%) of AU and 25 cases (25%) of AD. There were no significant differences between them. In these cases, however, AsIgE was significantly higher in AU than in AD. Percentage of patients with high AsIgE value (> class 2) was significantly higher in AU (20 cases, 24%) than in AD (3 cases, 3%).

We analyzed the clinical features, the serum total IgE and each allergen specific IgE level. In addition, ten seafood allergens were also classified by a cluster analysis. Three patients revealed immediate hypersensitivity to some seafood. The frequency of patients with AD and the total IgE in the seafood group were high and the patients in this group were tend to be sensitized to multiple allergens. Seafood allergens were classified into 4 groups, 1) salmon, sardine, horse mackerel and mackerel, 2) cod and tuna, 3) octopus and squid, and 4) crab and shrimp, by a cluster analysis.

We carried out a double-blind study to compare the sensory profile of four MSSWs with increasing mineral content. Methods: A panel of 36 women, trained to perform comparative sensory analysis, applied in pairs four MSSWs with mineral contents of 0.2, 0.45, 5, and 11 g/L on the right and left cheeks. At baseline, 5 min, and 10 min after the applications, the subjects evaluated each water for the following factors using a computerized analog scale: freshness, mild stinging, softness, suppleness, and comfort of the skin. Results: After 5 min, all four waters induced a sensation of freshness, irrespective of their mineral concentration. A mild stinging was also perceived with all four waters, with a magnitude that was dependent on the mineral density. After 10 min, softness, suppleness, and skin comfort were the prominent features induced by the waters, but the lower the mineral content, the greater these perceptions. Statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the 0.2 g/L group and the 5 and 11 g/L groups for stinging (P = 0.0001), softness and suppleness (P < 0.05), and skin comfort (P = 0.006) after 10 min.

It frequently starts in the first year of life. There is agreement on the existence of psychological influences on this disease. Although some studies in this field examine aspects of the parent-child relationship, studies concerning early infancy are very rare. The present study was conducted in order to find out whether maternal characteristics relevant to the mother-infant relationship, i.e. depressiveness/hopelessness, child-rearing attitudes and perceived infant behaviour, associated with infant AD. Methods: Two cohorts (3- to 4-month- and 10- to 12-month-old infants), each with 20 infants suffering from AD, and 20 healthy infants were recruited. AD infants were further divided into subgroups according to the diagnostic criteria: atopic family history, itching and characteristic locations of eczema. After a paediatric examination of the infant, mothers completed standardized questionnaires concerning depressiveness/hopelessness, child-rearing attitudes and perception of infant behaviour. Results: Varying with different diagnostic features of the infants' AD, mothers of AD infants described themselves as more depressive/hopeless, as more anxious/overprotective and characterized their infant as less frequently positive and more frequently negative in its emotional behaviour compared to the control group. Conclusion: The results underline the importance of psychological support for mothers of infants with AD.","Atopic eczema; Child-rearing attitudes; Maternal depressiveness; Mother-infant relationship;

Internal consistencies of the six scales were very good to satisfactory, with Cronbach's α ranging from .93 to .62.

It was found that patients with atopic dermatitis are significantly more depressive and scored higher for state anxiety (P < 0.05) than the normal control group. They also tended to be more psychosomatic symptom-prone and to score higher for trait anxiety. NK activity in patients with atopic dermatitis was significantly lower than in normal controls (P < 0.01), while serum IFN-γ levels tended to be slightly higher and serum IL-4 levels somewhat lower. No significant correlation was detected between any pair of psychological test/immunological examination for either patients or normal controls. However, in the examination of path analyses, psychological variables affect serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 more in the patients than the normal controls. Only STAI(T) and (S) affect NK activity in atopic dermatitis patients. By a discriminant analysis, NK cell activity and serum IFN-γ appeared statistically significant. We conclude that the psychological state is to some extent related to the immunological state.","Atopic dermatitis; Immunological state; Psychological state; Psychoneuroimmunology","gamma interferon; interleukin 4; adolescent; adult; anxiety; article; atopic dermatitis; clinical article; controlled study; depression; human; natural killer cell; neuropsychological test; priority journal; psychophysiology; psychosomatic disorder; school child; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Child; Depression; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Interferon Type II; Killer Cells, Natural; Middle Aged; Models, Immunological; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychoneuroimmunology; Reference Values",,"Interferon Type II, 82115-62-6",,,,,,,,"Hashiro, M., Okumura, M., Anxiety, depression and psychosomatic symptoms in patients with atopic dermatitis: Comparison with normal controls and among groups of different degrees of severity (1997) J Dermatol Sci, 14, pp. 63-67; Takahashi, T., Sasaki, Y., Hama, K., Furue, M., Ishibashi, Y., Production of IL-4, IL-2, IFN-γ And TNF-α By peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with atopic dermatitis (1992) J Dermatol Sci, 3, pp. 172-180; Kasamatsu, M., Tsuji, T., Miura, M., A method for quantification of interleukin-4 in serum (sandwich ELISA) and IL-4 levels in patients with atopic dermatitis (1993) Jpn J Allergol, 42, pp. 878-882; Thepen, T., Langeveld-Wildschut, E.G., Bihart, I.C., Van Wichen, D.F., Van Reijsen, F.C., Mudde, G.C., Bruijnzeel-Koomen, C.A., Biphasic response against aeroallergen in atopic dermatitis showing a switch from an initial TH2 response to a TH1 response in situ: An immunohistochemical study (1996) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 97, pp. 828-837; Spielberger, C.D., Gorsuch, R.L., Lushere, R.E., (1970) STAI Manual, pp. 23-49. , Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologist; Zung, W.W.K., A self-rating depression scale (1965) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 12, pp. 63-70; Broadmann, K., Erdmann, A.J., Lorge, I., Wolff, H.G., Broadbent, T.H., The Cornell medical index (1949) J Am Med Assoc, 140, pp. 530-534; Nakazato, K., Shimonaka, Y., The Japanese state-trait anxiety inventory: Age and sex differences (1989) Perceptual Motor Skills, 69, pp. 611-617; Faked, K., Kobayashi, S., A study on a self-rating depression scale (1973) Seishin-Shinkeigaku Zasshi (Tokyo), 75, pp. 673-679; Kanehisa, T., Fukamachi, K., (1972) The Cornell Medical Index, , Japanese ed.

We assessed the distribution of the severity of atopic eczema in the community and investigated differences between east and west Germany. A factor analysis was then carried out to characterize the variables of this scoring system and to analyse possible relationships within them. A multicentre cross-sectional study was carried out in five east German and two west German locations in 1994; pre-school children (5-6 years old) were investigated and cases of atopic eczema identified by a dermatological examination. The SCORAD was used to determine the severity of atopic eczema and the results assessed using analysis of variance and principal component analysis (varimax rotation). In all, 1511 (76.2%) of the children originally contacted participated and 11.3% were diagnosed with atopic eczema at the time of examination. The median severity score was 21.4 (interquartile range 13.5) and there was a tendency to higher scores in west Germany for the mean overall score, the intensity score and the extent. 'Erythema' (1.30 vs. 1.06: P=0.006) and 'excoriation' (0.77 vs. 0.36; P=0.002) were significantly more prominent in children with eczema from west Germany (adjusted for observer). Interobserver variabilities of the SCORAD parameters were calculated, adjusted for location and were in accordance with earlier findings. Principal component analysis identified three independent factors accounting for 54.1% of the total variance. A severity factor, characterized by 'extent', 'lichenification', 'excoriation' and 'pruritus', was separated from a factor with an acute eczema-type profile ('erythema', 'oedema', 'oozing') and a factor whose major characteristics were 'extent', 'dryness', and 'sleep loss'. We conclude that atopic eczema is frequent in pre-school children. The SCORAD proved to be readily applicable and useful in epidemiological studies, but further validation is needed.",,"article; atopic dermatitis; disease severity; factorial analysis; germany; human; major clinical study; preschool child; priority journal; scoring system; Analysis of Variance; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Germany; Humans; Observer Variation; Prevalence; Severity of Illness Index",,,,,,,,,,"Schultz-Larsen, F., Hanifin, J., Secular change in the occurrence of atopic dermatitis (1992) Acta Derm Venereol (Stockh), 176 (71 SUPPL.), pp. 7-12; Ninan, T., Russell, G., Respiratory symptoms and atopy in Aberdeen schoolchildren: Evidence from two surveys 25 years apart (1992) Br Med J, 304, pp. 873-875; Schultz-Larsen, F., The epidemiology of atopic dermatitis (1995) Epidemiology of Clinical Allergy, pp. 9-28. , (Burr M. ed.).

Pyoderma may be a primary, idiopathic disease or secondary to a range of other dermatological disorders. In this study, the serum concentrations of IgG, IgA, antistaphylococcal IgG and antistaphylococcal IgA were measured by ELISA in normal dogs (n = 22), dogs with idiopathic deep pyoderma (n = 22), atopic dermatitis and superficial pyoderma (n = 24), atopic dermatitis without pyoderma (n = 25), flea bite dermatitis with superficial pyoderma (n = 8), pustular demodicosis (n = 8) and German shepherd dogs with anal furunculosis (n = 28). The serum IgG was significantly increased in dogs with atopy and superficial pyoderma (p < 0.001), and lower than normal in dogs with idiopathic deep pyoderma (p < 0.015). The concentration of serum IgA was significantly lower than normal in dogs with atopy uncomplicated by pyoderma (p < 0.015). The concentration of antistaphylococcal IgG in all clinical sera was significantly elevated (p < 0.001) when compared to normal dogs but concentrations of antistaphylococcal IgA were no greater than in normal dogs. Western blotting analysis for determination of the specificity of serum IgG antistaphylococcal antibody revealed that there were nine major epitopes. Discriminant analysis demonstrated that particular combinations of these epitopes were recognised more frequently by sera from dogs in different clinical groups.","Dogs; Humoral immune response; Staphylococcus intermedius","bacterium antibody; epitope; immunoglobulin a; immunoglobulin g; animal experiment; animal model; article; atopic dermatitis; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; furunculosis; humoral immunity; immunoglobulin blood level; insect bite; nonhuman; pustulosis; pyoderma; staphylococcus infection; Animals; Antibodies, Bacterial; Antibody Specificity; Antigens, Bacterial; Blotting, Western; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Furunculosis; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin G; Male; Pyoderma; Staphylococcal Skin Infections; Staphylococcus; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Canis familiaris; Insecta; Siphonaptera (fleas); Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus intermedius",,"Antibodies, Bacterial; Antigens, Bacterial; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin G",,,,,,,,"Day, M.J., Penhale, W.J., Serum immunoglobulin a concentrations in normal and diseased dogs (1988) Res.

A population of 225 subjects was chosen randomly from school children aged 11 to 14 years. The children underwent blood analyses (PRIST, RAST) and allergy tests (prick tests) to determine whether or not there was symptomatic or asymptomatic atopia. Thirty six of them had increased IgE associated with symptoms of atopic dermatitis, 35 had increased IgE without any clinical sign, and 154 comprised the normal control group. The phychological tests used were the Raven PM 38 for measurement of intelligence quotient, the Busnelli, Dall'Aglio and Fania Anxiety Scale Questionnaire and the Porter and Cattel Children's Personality Questionnaire. The atopic subjects had higher scores in the tests for intelligence, were more anxious and more introverted. The data were analyzed by discriminant analysis. The group with atopic dermatitis was clearly differentiated from the other groups. They were more introverted and submissive than the other subjects. On the basis of these results atopic dermatitis appears to have a prevalently biological genesis and the personality traits found could be parallel effects that maintain the disorder and increase the itching.","atopic dermatitis; pathogenesis; personality; stress","adolescent; article; atopic dermatitis; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; personality; school child; stress",,,,,,,,,,,"Polenghi, M.M.; Istituto di Dermatologia, Via Pace, 9, 20122 Milano, Italy",,,,,,,,0365169X,,ADCRA,,"English","ANN.

Assessment methods for atopic dermatitis (AD) are not standardized. and therapeutic studies are difficult to interpret. Aims. To obtain a consensus on assessment methods in AD and to use a statistical method to develop a composite severity index.Methods. Consensus definitions were given for items used in the scoring system (extent, intensity, subjective) and illustrated for intensity items. Slides were reviewed to address within- and between-observer variability by a group of 10 trained clinicians, and data were statistically evaluated with a two-way analysis of variance. Two variants of an assessment system were compared in 88 patients at 5 different institutions. Data were analyzed using principal-component analysis. Results. For 5 intensity items studied (erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crusts, excoriations, lichenification), within- and between-observer variability was good overall, except for edema/papulation which was difficult to assess with slides. In the series of 88 patients, principal-component analysis allowed to extract two unrelated components: the first one accounting for 33% of total variance was interpreted as a ‘severity’ component; the second one, accounting for 18% of variance, was interpreted as a ‘profile’ component distinguishing patients with mostly erythema and subjective symptoms and those with mostly lichenification and dryness and lower subjective symptoms. Of the two evaluation systems used, the one using the rule of nine to assess extent was found more workable than the one using a distribution × intensity product. A scoring index (SCORAD) combining extent, severity and subjective symptoms was mathematically derived from the first system and showed a normal distribution of the population studied. Conclusion. The final choice for the evaluation system was mostly made based on simplicity and easy routine use in outpatient clinics. Based on mathematical appreciation of weights of the items used in the assessment of AD. extent and subjective symptoms account for around 20% each of the total score, intensity items representing 60%. The so-designed composite index SCORAD needs to be further tested in clinical trials. © 1993 S.

Furthermore, we were interested in what clinical characteristics might co-vary with psychological disability in patients with atopic dermatitis. In all, 93 patients filled in a standardized mood scale (Hamburg-Erlanger-Stimmungsbarometer) and a personality scale (Kurztest zur Erfassung der Personlichkeitsstruktur). Compared with matched controls, patients described themselves as being more anxious, more aroused, more depressed and less energetic, and they reached higher neuroticism scores. A cluster analysis identified four patient subgroups. Only one of the subgroups (n = 17) was psychologically disabled according to the questionnaire scores. In contrast to a psychologically stabile patient group, the psychologically disabled patients showed an earlier age of onset of dermatitis, but less intense itching and scratching. They reported more somatic complaints and a higher level of familial stress, were more dissatisfied with their life situation and work, had fewer friends and experienced more losses of significant others.

Adjusted mean weal areas for almost all allergens, except pollens and few other allergens, were significantly larger in farmers than in non-farming controls. In contrast, only skin reactions to cow dander, to a non-dialyzed crude preparation of fodder yeast Candida utilis, and to Candida albicans distinguished symptomatic subjects from asymptomatic ones. Stepwise discriminant analysis, in which reactions to all allergens as well as age, sex, and atopy were taken into account simultaneously, revealed that reactions to a dialysed preparation of fodder yeast best distinguished symptomatic farmers from asymptomatic ones. C. utilis and C. albicans may be cross-reactive. The results imply that skin tests alone are of limited value in the search for work-related causes of rhinitis or asthma among dairy farmers.

Individual sera frequently gave positive results with several discs - in particular with birch pollen, apple, carrot and celery tuber discs.
