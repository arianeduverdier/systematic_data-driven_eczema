Our aim was to investigate reported onset of childhood wheeze, rhinitis and eczema symptoms in relation to prenatal, perinatal and postnatal home environment. Data on home environment and symptoms (ISAAC based questions) in first two years of life and in the past 12 months were reported by parents of the children (3–6 y) in a cross-sectional questionnaire survey in ten day care centers in Taiyuan, northern China (N = 3606). Changes of symptoms from the first 2 years of life to the past 12 months (recall period) were calculated retrospectively. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was applied. Reported onset of wheeze, rhinitis and eczema were 11.8%, 22.2% and 3.3%, respectively. Redecorating during pregnancy increased reported onset of rhinitis (OR = 2.29) and eczema (OR = 4.91). New furniture during pregnancy increased reported onset of rhinitis (OR = 1.47). Perinatal indoor mould increased reported onset of wheeze (OR = 1.51), rhinitis (OR = 1.65) and eczema (OR = 1.91). Perinatal mould odour increased reported onset of wheeze (OR = 1.85). Perinatal window pane condensation increased reported onset of wheeze (OR = 1.54) and rhinitis (OR = 1.24). Perinatal stuffy air and dry air in the home increased reported onset of all three symptoms (ORs 1.46–2.24). Dog keeping increased reported onset of wheeze (OR = 1.69) and eczema (OR = 2.13). Based on principal component analysis, four exposure scores were calculated (renovation, new furniture, mould and indoor air quality scores). Dose-response relationships were observed between these exposure scores and reported onset of symptoms. In conclusion, prenatal and postnatal exposure to emissions from renovation and new furniture can increase reported onset of childhood wheeze, rhinitis and eczema. Perinatal indoor mould, mould odour, condensation on window panes and impaired indoor air quality at home can be associated with reported development of wheeze, rhinitis and eczema in preschoolers in northern China. © 2021 The Authors","Asthma; Early life; Eczema; Indoor air quality; Mould; Redecoration; Rhinitis","Air quality; Condensation; Indoor air pollution; Logistic regression; Molds; Obstetrics; Surveys; Day care centers; Dose response relationships; Home environment; Indoor air quality; Multi-level logistics; Postnatal exposure; Preschool children; Questionnaire surveys; Quality control; air quality; allergy; asthma; child health; fungus; indoor air; pregnancy; skin disorder; symptom; China; Shanxi; Taiyuan",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 81861138005

The profiles of HMOs produced differ between mothers. Objective: We sought to determine the relationship between maternal HMO profiles and offspring allergic diseases up to age 18 years. Methods: Colostrum and early lactation milk samples were collected from 285 mothers enrolled in a high-allergy-risk birth cohort, the Melbourne Atopy Cohort Study. Nineteen HMOs were measured. Profiles/patterns of maternal HMOs were determined using LCA. Details of allergic disease outcomes including sensitization, wheeze, asthma, and eczema were collected at multiple follow-ups up to age 18 years. Adjusted logistic regression analyses and generalized estimating equations were used to determine the relationship between HMO profiles and allergy. Results: The levels of several HMOs were highly correlated with each other. LCA determined 7 distinct maternal milk profiles with memberships of 10% and 20%. Compared with offspring exposed to the neutral Lewis HMO profile, exposure to acidic Lewis HMOs was associated with a higher risk of allergic disease and asthma over childhood (odds ratio asthma at 18 years, 5.82; 95% CI, 1.59-21.23), whereas exposure to the acidic-predominant profile was associated with a reduced risk of food sensitization (OR at 12 years, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.67). Conclusions: In this high-allergy-risk birth cohort, some profiles of HMOs were associated with increased and some with decreased allergic disease risks over childhood. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and realize the potential for intervention. © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","allergy; childhood; Human milk oligosaccharides; latent class analysis",,,,,,"National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC

Objectives: To investigate risk factors for AD burden in the first 3 years of life. Methods: The Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2010 included 700 children. AD burden was assessed by daily diary entries with information on AD and steroid days measuring 18 possible heritable, prenatal, and postnatal environmental exposures. Results: The children with AD had a median (interquartile range) of 136 symptom days (61-294 days) and 72 steroid days (27-145 days) during the first 3 years of life, with the highest disease burden in the second year of life. The multivariable risk factor analysis showed that maternal AD and childhood allergic sensitization were associated with a higher number of AD days and maternal AD, filaggrin mutation, and allergic sensitization were associated with a higher number of steroid days. Limitations: Participants with a personal interest in atopic diseases could be more likely to participate. Conclusion: Children's burden of AD, assessed quantitatively as AD and steroid days, demonstrated positive associations with maternal AD, filaggrin mutation, and early-life allergic sensitization, with the highest disease burden in the second year of life. © 2020 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.","atopic dermatitis; burden of disease; corticosteroids; eczema severity; filaggrin; pediatrics","filaggrin; hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone butyrate; steroid; adult; allergic rhinitis; allergy; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; childhood; cohort analysis; data analysis software; disease burden; disease severity; eczema; environmental exposure; environmental factor; family history; female; gene mutation; heritability; human; infant; major clinical study; male; maternal disease; newborn; perinatal period; prenatal exposure; priority journal; risk factor; sensitization; steroid therapy; symptom; topical treatment",,"hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; hydrocortisone butyrate, 13609-67-1",,,"Natur og Univers, Det Frie Forskningsråd, FNU, DFF

Yields (ppb product emitted/ppb ozone consumed) for 40 products were quantified. Major products of the primary reaction of ozone-squalene included 6-methyl 5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO) and geranyl acetone (GA) with average yields of 0.22 and 0.16, respectively. Other major products included decanal, methacrolein (or methyl vinyl ketone), nonanal, and butanal. Yields varied widely among participants; summed yields ranged from 0.33 to 0.93. The dynamic increase in emission rates during ozone exposure also varied among participants, possibly indicative of differences in the thickness of the skin lipid layer. Factor analysis indicates that much of the variability among participants is due to factors associated with the relative abundance of (1) ""fresh""skin lipid constituents (such as squalene and fatty acids), (2) oxidized skin lipids, and (3) exogenous compounds. This last factor appears to be associated with the presence of oleic and linoleic acids and could be accounted for by uptake of cooking oils or personal care products to skin lipids. ©",,"Acetone; Aliphatic compounds; Linoleic acid; Lipids; Oils and fats; Ozone; Ozone layer; Average yield; Emission rates; Methyl vinyl ketones; Ozone exposures; Personal care products; Primary reaction; Relative abundance; Volatile products; Skin care products; acetone; butyraldehyde; carbonyl derivative; decanoic acid; fatty acid; nonanal; ozone; skin lipid; squalene; squalene derivative; triacylglycerol; ozone; reaction kinetics; skin; yield response; adult; Article; chemical analysis; chemical reaction; clinical article; eczema; factor analysis; female; human; humidity; male; ozonation; retention time; sequential analysis; skin; steady state; surface property; varimax rotation",,"acetone, 67-64-1; butyraldehyde, 123-72-8; decanoic acid, 334-48-5, 3398-75-2; nonanal, 124-19-6; ozone, 10028-15-6; squalene, 111-02-4, 7683-64-9","Monitor Labs ML9811 Photometric Ozone Analyzer; Vocus PTR-TOF-MS",,"Alfred P.

Stratification of patients into biomarker-based endotypes is important for future development of personalized therapies. Objective: Our aim was to confirm previously defined serum biomarker-based patient clusters in a new cohort of patients with AD. Methods: A panel of 143 biomarkers was measured by using Luminex technology in serum samples from 146 patients with severe AD (median Eczema Area and Severity Index = 28.3; interquartile range = 25.2-35.3). Principal components analysis followed by unsupervised k-means cluster analysis of the biomarker data was used to identify patient clusters. A prediction model was built on the basis of a previous cohort to predict the 1 of the 4 previously identified clusters to which the patients of our new cohort would belong. Results: Cluster analysis identified 4 serum biomarker–based clusters, 3 of which (clusters B, C, and D) were comparable to the previously identified clusters. Cluster A (33.6%) could be distinguished from the other clusters as being a “skin-homing chemokines/IL-1R1–dominant” cluster, whereas cluster B (18.5%) was a “TH1/TH2/TH17-dominant” cluster, cluster C (18.5%) was a “TH2/TH22/PARC-dominant” cluster, and cluster D (29.5%) was a “TH2/eosinophil-inferior” cluster. Additionally, by using a prediction model based on our previous cohort we accurately assigned the new cohort to the 4 previously identified clusters by including only 10 selected serum biomarkers. Conclusion: We confirmed that AD is heterogeneous at the immunopathologic level and identified 4 distinct biomarker-based clusters, 3 of which were comparable with previously identified clusters. Cluster membership could be predicted with a model including 10 serum biomarkers. © 2020 The Authors","Atopic dermatitis; biomarkers; clusters; endotypes; personalized medicine; prediction; principal components analysis","azathioprine; biological marker; C-C motif chemokine 18; corticosteroid; cutaneous T cell attracting chemokine; cyclosporine; eotaxin; epidermal growth factor; gamma interferon; interleukin 1; interleukin 1 receptor type I; interleukin 13; interleukin 17; interleukin 21; interleukin 22; interleukin 25; interleukin 26; interleukin 33; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; lymphotoxin; macrophage derived chemokine; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; mycophenolic acid; RANTES; tacrolimus; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; tumor necrosis factor; adult; allergic asthma; allergic rhinitis; Article; atopic dermatitis; atopy; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; Eczema Area and Severity Index; electronic medical record; female; food allergy; human; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal",,"azathioprine, 446-86-6; cyclosporine, 59865-13-3, 63798-73-2, 79217-60-0; epidermal growth factor, 59459-45-9, 62229-50-9; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; interleukin 21, 251100-02-4, 510787-82-3, 542817-56-1; interleukin 22, 457106-70-6, 478219-35-1, 554460-75-2; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5, 7532-09-4, 6745-93-3; mycophenolate mofetil, 116680-01-4, 128794-94-5; mycophenolic acid, 23047-11-2, 24280-93-1; tacrolimus, 104987-11-3; thymus and activation regulated chemokine, 181532-29-6",,,,"Research was funded by Regeneron and Sanofi Genzyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,,,"Werfel, T., Allam, J.P., Biedermann, T., Eyerich, K., Gilles, S., Guttman-Yassky, E., Cellular and molecular immunologic mechanisms in patients with atopic dermatitis (2016) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 138, pp. 336-349; Bieber, T., D'Erme, A.M., Akdis, C.A., Traidl-Hoffmann, C., Lauener, R., Schappi, G., Clinical phenotypes and endophenotypes of atopic dermatitis: where are we, and where should we go?

Method: Meat inspectors at four processing plants located in the Northland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Taranaki regions of New Zealand graded all dairy cattle livers on particular days in April and May of 2018 and 2019 using a gross liver pathology score (GLS) from 0–5 (0 = no damage, 1= fatty liver, 2 = cholangitis and early cirrhosis, 3 = cirrhosis, 4 = extensive cirrhosis, 5 = regeneration). Forty livers from each grade were selected for histopathology. Sections from the apical margin of the right and the left lobes were scored using a histology biliary score (HBS; scored from 1–16) based on the classical histological lesions of FE focussing on changes that differentiate FE from fasciolosis. Mean HBS was collapsed into scores 2–6 (no and mild damage) and score 7–12 (moderate and severe) and GLS was collapsed into grades 0–2 (no or mild damage) and grades 3–5 (moderate, severe and chronic damage). A Bayesian latent class model was developed to estimate sensitivity and specificity of HBS and GLS. The diagnostic target was moderate or severe, gross and/or histological changes in the liver consistent with FE. Results: A total of 2,899 dairy cow livers were graded at the four plants over the two study periods. There were 700/2,899 (24.1%) livers with at least some form of gross pathology damage (GLS≥1) and 130/2,899 (4.5%) livers with moderate, severe or chronic gross pathology damage (GLS≥3). The estimates (posterior median) for the sensitivity and specificity of GLS to liver damage were 0.844 (95% credible interval (CrI) = 0.757–0.905) and 0.932 (95% CrI = 0.866–0.973) respectively. Estimates for HBS were 0.834 (95% CrI = 0.765–0.892) and 0.778 (95% CrI = 0.707–0.854), respectively. Conclusion and clinical relevance: GLS is a useful means of estimating liver damage consistent with FE at slaughter. Increased use of liver scoring at slaughter could be useful for monitoring the likely impacts of FE at the country and regional levels. © 2020 New Zealand Veterinary Association.","Facial eczema; gross pathology; histology; liver damage; processing plants","animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autumn; cholangitis; dairy cattle; eczema; face; fascioliasis; fatty liver; fibrosis; gross liver pathology score; histology; histology biliary score; histopathology; hyperplasia; inflammation; inspector; latent class analysis; liver cirrhosis; liver injury; mononuclear peribiliary inflammation; New Zealand; nonhuman; periportal eosinophilic inflammation; periportal lymphatic ectasia; portal vessel thickening; prevalence; regeneration; sensitivity and specificity",,,,,"Massey University

Being in a global initiative of characterisation of black skin horny layer (stratum corneum) by digital images analysis, the authors in this study proposed a four-step approach. The first step consists of differentiation between probable healthy skin regions and those affected. For that, they used an automatic classification system based on multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks. The network has been trained with texture and colour features. Best features selection and network architecture definition were done using sequential network construction algorithm-based method. After classification, selected regions undergo a colour transformation, in order to increase the contrast with the lesion region. Thirdly, created colour information serves as the basis for a modified fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm to perform segmentation. The proposed method, named neural network-based fuzzy clustering, was applied to many black skin lesion images and they obtained segmentation rates up to 94.67%. The last stage consists in calculating characteristics. Eight parameters are concerned: uniformity, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, smoothness, entropy, and average pixel values calculated for red and blue colour channels. All developed methods were tested with a database of 600 images and obtained results were discussed and compared with similar works. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Here, we present a method for variance components analysis that is accurate and efficient: capable of estimating one hundred variance components on a million individuals genotyped at a million SNPs in a few hours. We illustrate the utility of our method in estimating and partitioning variation in a trait explained by genotyped SNPs (SNP-heritability). Analyzing 22 traits with genotypes from 300,000 individuals across about 8 million common and low frequency SNPs, we observe that per-allele squared effect size increases with decreasing minor allele frequency (MAF) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) consistent with the action of negative selection. Partitioning heritability across 28 functional annotations, we observe enrichment of heritability in FANTOM5 enhancers in asthma, eczema, thyroid and autoimmune disorders. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"allele; detection method; estimation method; gene expression; genetic marker; genetic variation; genome; genotype; heritability; Article; asthma; classification algorithm; eczema; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene mutation; genetic variability; genetic variation; genome; genome-wide association study; genotype; mathematical phenomena; molecular genetics; physical phenomena; principal component analysis; simulation; single nucleotide polymorphism; thyroid disease; variance; allele; biological model; genetics; human; human genome; multifactorial inheritance; phenotype; quantitative trait; Alleles; Gene Frequency; Genetic Variation; Genome, Human; Genotype; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Models, Genetic; Multifactorial Inheritance; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait, Heritable",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

However, the factors contributing to this susceptibility are incompletely understood. In a retrospective analysis of clinical samples collected from a prospectively-enrolled cohort of 358 children we sought associations between physician-attended illness visits and bacterial colonization in the first five years of life. A subset of children was identified by unsupervised clustering analysis as infection and allergy prone (IAP). Several respiratory infection- and allergy-mediated illnesses co-occurred at higher rates in IAP children, while the rates of other illnesses were not significantly different between the groups. Analyses of nasopharyngeal (NP) pathobionts and microbiota commensals showed that early age of first colonization with pathobionts Streptococcus pneumonia, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis was associated with IAP children, and particularly Moraxella abundance was negatively associated with NP microbiome diversity. We conclude that mucosal pathobiont exposures in early life can influence susceptibility to respiratory illnesses in children. © 2020 Chapman et al.

We investigated 170 children who regularly followed up at our clinic for 4 years in a birth cohort study with at least 3 time-points of serum samples. The pattern of total serum IgE levels from 6 months to 4 years of age was clustered using K-means method in R software. Specific immunoglobulin E antibodies against food (egg white and milk) and inhalant allergens (D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae) were measured at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 years of age. By using K-means clustering, the dynamic changes in serum IgE levels was significantly stratified into 3 clusters (cluster A, < 100 kU/L, n = 106; cluster B, 100–200 kU/L, n = 35; cluster C, ≥ 200 kU/L, n = 29). A persistent total IgE levels higher than 100 kU/L appeared to be associated with higher prevalence of sensitization to food but not mite. However, a persistent IgE levels higher than 200 kU/L was not only remarkably related to increased prevalence of mite sensitization, but also risk of eczema at age 1 and allergic rhinitis and asthma at age 2, 3 and 4. In conclusion, a persistent total serum IgE level ≥ 200 kU/L since infancy is strongly associated with the presence of food and mite sensitization, as well as the development of eczema in infants, and rhinitis and asthma later in early childhood. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,,,,,"Chang Gung Medical Foundation: CMRPG3E1191-5","This study was supported by research grant of CMRPG3E1191-5 from the Chang Gung Medical foundation, Chang Gung University, Taiwan.

Psoriasis can be monitored through gold standard histopathology of biopsy specimens that are painful and permanently scar. A common associated measure is the use of non-invasive assessment of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) or similarly derived clinical assessment based scores. However, heterogeneous manifestations of the disease lead to specific PASI scores being poorly reproducible and not easily associated with clinical severity, complicating the efforts to monitor the disease. To address this issue, we developed a methodology for non-invasive automated assessment of the severity of psoriasis using optical imaging. Our analysis shows that two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging permits the identification of biomarkers present in both lesional and non-lesional skin that correlate with psoriasis severity. This ability to measure changes in lesional and healthy-appearing skin provides a new pathway for independent monitoring of both the localized and systemic effects of the disease. Non-invasive optical imaging was conducted on lesions and non-lesional (pseudo-control) skin of 33 subjects diagnosed with psoriasis, lesional skin of 7 subjects diagnosed with eczema, and healthy skin of 18 control subjects. Statistical feature extraction was combined with principal component analysis to analyze pairs of two-photon fluorescence lifetime images of stratum basale and stratum granulosum layers of skin. We found that psoriasis is associated with biochemical and structural changes in non-lesional skin that can be assessed using clinically available two-photon fluorescence lifetime microscopy systems. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"biological marker; diagnostic imaging; female; fluorescence; fluorescence imaging; fluorescence microscopy; human; male; metabolism; multivariate analysis; pathology; procedures; psoriasis; severity of illness index; skin; Biomarkers; Female; Fluorescence; Humans; Male; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Multivariate Analysis; Optical Imaging; Psoriasis; Severity of Illness Index; Skin",,"Biomarkers",,,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, UIUC: 11012

Objective: To characterize the triggers of itch in adult AD. Methods: This was a prospective dermatology practice–based study using questionnaires and evaluation by a dermatologist (n = 587). Thirteen itch triggers were assessed using the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system Itch-Triggers. Results: Overall, 381 (64.9%) patients reported greater than or equal to 1 itch trigger in the past week and 212 (36.1%) reported greater than or equal to 3 itch triggers. The most commonly reported triggers were stress (35.4%), sweat (30.5%), weather change (24.7%), dry air (24.4%), and heat (24.0%). In multivariable Poisson regression models, the number of itch triggers was associated with more severe patient-reported global AD severity, Numeric Rating Scale worst itch, Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, Scoring Atopic Dermatitis sleep, Numeric Rating Scale skin pain, Eczema Area and Severity Index, and objective Scoring Atopic Dermatitis. The seasonality of AD was associated with distinct itch triggers. In multivariable logistic regression models, the number of itch triggers was associated with less than or equal to 3 months of AD remission during the year, greater than or equal to 2 AD flares, and AD being worse during some seasons. Four patterns of itch triggers were identified using latent class analysis, each associated with different clinical characteristics. Conclusion: Itch triggers are common and affect the course of AD. Itch triggers are an important end point to assess in patients with AD. © 2020 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",,"antihistaminic agent; corticosteroid; cyclosporine; dupilumab; emollient agent; gabapentin; methotrexate; mycophenolic acid; adult; aged; Article; atopic dermatitis; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dermatologist; dermatology; disease association; disease course; disease exacerbation; disease severity; eczema; Eczema Area and Severity Index; female; heat; human; human tissue; life stress; major clinical study; male; medical examination; medical practice; numeric rating scale; outcome assessment; Patient Oriented Eczema Measure; patient-reported outcome; phototherapy; priority journal; prospective study; pruritus; questionnaire; remission; risk factor; Scoring Atopic Dermatitis; scoring system; seasonal variation; skin pain; sweat; very elderly; weather; atopic dermatitis; latent class analysis; middle aged; pathophysiology; pruritus; season; severity of illness index; statistical model; symptom assessment; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Latent Class Analysis; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Prospective Studies; Pruritus; Seasons; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Symptom Assessment",,"cyclosporine, 59865-13-3, 63798-73-2, 79217-60-0; dupilumab, 1190264-60-8; gabapentin, 60142-96-3; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; mycophenolic acid, 23047-11-2, 24280-93-1",,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ: K12 HS023011

Epitope-specific IgE levels have been correlated with the severity of egg allergy, while emerging evidence suggests that other antibody isotypes (IgG1, IgG4, IgA, and IgD) may have a protective function; yet, their epitope-specific repertoires and associations with atopic comorbidities have not been studied. Methods: Bead-based epitope assay (BBEA) was used to quantitate the levels of epitope-specific (es)IgA, esIgE, esIgD, esIgG1, and esIgG4 antibodies directed at 58 (15-mer) overlapping peptides, covering the entire sequence of ovomucoid, in plasma of 38 egg-allergic and 6 atopic children. Intraclass correlation (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) were used for the reliability assessment. The relationships across esIgs were evaluated using network analysis; linear and logistic regressions were used to compare groups based on egg allergy status and comorbidities. Results: BBEA had high reliability (ICC &gt;0.75) and low variability (CV &lt;20%) and could detect known IgE-binding epitopes. Egg-allergic children had lower esIgA1 (P =.010) and esIgG1 (P =.016) and higher esIgE (P &lt;.001) and esIgD (P =.015) levels compared to the atopic controls. Interestingly, within the allergic group, children with higher esIgD had decreased odds of anaphylactic reactions (OR =0.48, P =.038). Network analysis identified most associations between esIgE with either esIgG4 or esIgD; indicating that IgE-secreting plasma cells could originate from either sequential isotype switch from antigen-experienced intermediate isotypes or directly from the IgD+ B cells. Conclusions: Collectively, these data point toward a contribution of epitope-specific antibody repertoires to the pathogenesis of egg allergy. © 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) is not yet fully understood, but the bacterial composition of AD patients' skin has been shown to have an increased abundance of Staphylococcus aureus. More recently, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) species were shown to be able to inhibit S. aureus, but further studies are required to determine the effects of Staphylococcus community variation in AD. Aim. Here we investigated whether analysing metabarcoding data with the more recently developed DADA2 approach improves metabarcoding analyses compared to the previously used operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering, and can be used to study Staphylococcus community dynamics. Methods. The bacterial 16S rRNA region from tape strip samples of the stratum corneum of AD patients (non-lesional skin) and non-AD controls was metabarcoded. We processed metabarcoding data with two different bioinformatic pipelines (an OTU clustering method and DADA2), which were analysed with and without technical replication (sampling strategy). Results. We found that OTU clustering and DADA2 performed well for community-level studies, as demonstrated by the identification of significant differences in the skin bacterial communities associated with AD. However, the OTU clustering approach inflated bacterial richness, which was worsened by not having technical replication. Data processed with DADA2 likely handled sequencing errors more effectively and thereby did not inflate molecular richness. Conclusion. We believe that DADA2 represents an improvement over an OTU clustering approach, and that biological replication rather than technical replication is a more effective use of resources. However, neither OTU clustering nor DADA2 gave insights into Staphylococcus community dynamics, and caution should remain in not overinterpreting the taxonomic assignments at lower taxonomic ranks. © 2020 The Authors This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License.","Atopic dermatitis; DADA2; Eczema; Metabarcoding; OTU clustering; Skin microbiome; Staphylococcus aureus","RNA 16S; adult; aged; atopic dermatitis; biology; classification; cluster analysis; comparative study; DNA barcoding; female; genetics; human; male; microbiology; microflora; middle aged; skin; Staphylococcus aureus; young adult; Adult; Aged; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Dermatitis, Atopic; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; Female; Humans; Male; Microbiota; Middle Aged; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Skin; Staphylococcus aureus; Young Adult",,"RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",,,"Statens Serum Institut, SSI

Objective: To develop a convolutional neural network model to classify clinically relevant selected multiple-lesion skin diseases, this in accordance to the STARD guidelines. Methods: This was an image-based retrospective study using multi-task learning for binary classification. A VGG-16 model was trained on 16,543 non-standardized images. Image data was distributed in training set (80%), validation set (10%), and test set (10%). All images were collected from a clinical database of a Danish population attending one dermatological department. Included was patients categorized with ICD-10 codes related to acne, rosacea, psoriasis, eczema, and cutaneous t-cell lymphoma. Results: Acne was distinguished from rosacea with a sensitivity of 85.42% CI 72.24–93.93% and a specificity of 89.53% CI 83.97–93.68%, cutaneous t-cell lymphoma was distinguished from eczema with a sensitivity of 74.29% CI 67.82–80.05% and a specificity of 84.09% CI 80.83–86.99%, and psoriasis from eczema with a sensitivity of 81.79% CI 78.51–84.76% and a specificity of 73.57% CI 69.76–77.13%. All results were based on the test set. Conclusion: The performance rates reported were equal or superior to those reported for general practitioners with dermatological training, indicating that computer-aided diagnostic models based on convolutional neural network may potentially be employed for diagnosing multiple-lesion skin diseases. © Copyright © 2020 Thomsen, Christensen, Iversen, Lomholt and Winther.","acne; cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL); deep neural network (DNN); dermatology; ezcema; psoriasis; rosacea; skin disease","Article; atopic dermatitis; binary classification; contact dermatitis; convolutional neural network; cutaneous T cell lymphoma; Denmark; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; eczema; feasibility study; human; ICD-10; information processing; k means clustering; major clinical study; practice guideline; predictive value; psoriasis; retrospective study; rosacea; sensitivity and specificity; skin defect; visual memory",,,,,,,,,,"Hay, R.J., Johns, N.E., Williams, H.C., Bolliger, I.W., Dellavalle, R.P., Margolis, D.J., The global burden of skin disease in 2010: an analysis of the prevalence and impact of skin conditions (2014) J Invest Dermatol, 134, pp. 1527-1534. , 24166134; Julian, C.G., Dermatology in general practice (1999) Br J Dermatol, 141, pp. 518-520. , 10583058; Verhoeven, E.W., Kraaimaat, F.W., van Weel, C., van de Kerkhof, P.C., Duller, P., van der Valk, P.G., Skin diseases in family medicine: prevalence and health care use (2008) Ann Fam Med, 6, pp. 349-354. , 18626035; DermNet, N.Z., (2019), http://www.dermnetnz.org/, Available online at:, (Accessed February 16, 2019; Federman, D.G., Kirsner, R.S., The abilities of primary care physicians in dermatology: implications for quality of care (2017) Am J Manag Care, 3, pp. 1487-1492. , 10178455; Barrett, M., Luu, M., Differential diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (2017) Immunol Allergy Clin North Am, 37, pp. 11-34. , 27886900; Feng, H., Berk-Krauss, J., Feng, P.W., Stein, J.A., Comparison of dermatologist density between urban and rural counties in the United States (2018) JAMA Dermatol, 154, pp. 1265-1271. , 30193349; Thomsen, K., Iversen, L., Titlestad, T.L., Winther, O., Systematic review of machine learning for diagnosis and prognosis in dermatology (2019) J Dermatol Treat, , 31625775; Brinker, T.J., Hekler, A., Enk, A.H., Klode, J., Hauschild, A., Berking, C., Deep learning outperformed 136 of 157 dermatologists in a head-to-head dermoscopic melanoma image classification task (2019) Eur J Cancer, 113, pp. 47-54. , 30981091; Esteva, A., Kuprel, B., Novoa, R.A., Ko, J., Swetter, S.M., Blau, H.M., Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks (2017) Nature, 542, pp. 115-118. , 28117445; Han, S.S., Park, G.H., Lim, W., Kim, M.S., Na, J.I., Park, I., Deep neural networks show an equivalent and often superior performance to dermatologists in onychomycosis diagnosis: Automatic construction of onychomycosis datasets by region-based convolutional deep neural network (2018) PLoS ONE, 13, p. e0191493. , 29352285; Liu, Y., Jain, A., Eng, C., Way, D.H., Lee, K., Bui, P., A deep learning system for differential diagnosis of skin diseases (2019) EESS, , 32424212, (,); Wu, H., Yin, H., Chen, H., Sun, M., Liu, X., Yu, Y., A deep learning, image based approach for automated diagnosis for inflammatory skin diseases (2020) Ann Transl Med, 8, p. 581. , 32566608; Kim, Y.J., Han, S.S., Yang, H.J., Chang, S.E., Prospective, comparative evaluation of a deep neural network and dermoscopy in the diagnosis of onychomycosis (2020) PLoS ONE, 15, p. e0234334. , 32525908; Tschandl, P., Rinner, C., Apalla, Z., Argenziano, G., Codella, N., Halpern, A., Human-computer collaboration for skin cancer recognition (2020) Nat Med, 26, pp. 1229-1234. , 32572267; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Adv Neural Inform Process Syst, 1, pp. 1097-1105; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition (2014) ICLR; Cohen, J.F., Korevaar, D.A., Altman, D.G., Bruns, D.E., Gatsonis, C.A., Hooft, L., STARD 2015 guidelines for reporting diagnostic accuracy studies: explanation and elaboration (2016) BMJ open, 6, p. e012799. , 28137831; Solomon, B.A., Collins, R., Silverberg, N.B., Glass, A.T., Quality of care: issue or oversight in health care reform?

Techniques within natural language processing, a field of artificial intelligence, can analyze large amounts of text information and extract insights. Objective: To apply natural language processing to Reddit comments about dermatology topics to assess for feasibility and potential for insights and engagement. Methods: A software pipeline preprocessed Reddit comments from 2005 to 2017 from 7 popular dermatology-related subforums on Reddit, applied latent Dirichlet allocation, and used spectral clustering to establish cohesive themes and the frequency of word representation and grouped terms within these topics. Results: We created a corpus of 176,000 comments and identified trends in patient engagement in spaces such as eczema and acne, among others, with a focus on homeopathic treatments and isotretinoin. Limitations: Latent Dirichlet allocation is an unsupervised model, meaning there is no ground truth to which the model output can be compared. However, because these forums are anonymous, there seems little incentive for patients to be dishonest. Conclusions: Reddit data has viability and utility for dermatologic research and engagement with the public, especially for common dermatology topics such as tanning, acne, and psoriasis. © 2019 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.","artificial intelligence; natural language processing; patient education; patient engagement; Reddit; social media","isotretinoin; acne; Article; comparative study; data analysis; dermatology; eczema; evaluation study; feasibility study; homeopathy; human; natural language processing; patient participation; priority journal",,"isotretinoin, 4759-48-2",,,,,,,,"Perrin, A., Social media usage, 2005-2015 (2015), http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/08/social-networking-usage-2005-2015/, Pew Research Center (Accessed 12 December 2018); Savas, J.A., Huang, K.E., Tuchayi, S.M., Feldman, S.R., Understanding the influence of social media in medicine: lesson learned from Facebook (2014) Dermatol Online J, 20 (9); Buntinx-Krieg, T., Caravaglio, J., Domozych, R., Dellavalle, R., Dermatology on Reddit: elucidating trends in dermatologic communications on the world wide web (2017) Dermatol Online J, 23 (7); Vance, K., Howe, W., Dellavalle, R.P., Social internet sites as a source of public health information (2009) Dermatol Clin, 27 (2), pp. 133-136; Nadkarni, P.M., Ohno-Machado, L., Chapman, W.W., Natural language processing: an introduction (2011) J Am Med Inform Assoc, 18 (5), pp. 544-551; Friedman, C., Hripcsak, G., Natural language processing and its future in medicine (1999) Acad Med, 74 (8), pp. 890-895; Hripcsak, G., Friedman, C., Alderson, P.O., Unlocking clinical data from narrative reports: a study of natural language processing (1995) Ann Intern Med, 122 (9), pp. 681-688; Sarker, A., Belousov, M., Friedrichs, J., Data and systems for medication-related text classification and concept normalization from Twitter: insights from the Social Media Mining for Health (SMM4H)-2017 shared task (2018) J Am Med Inform Assoc, 25 (10), pp. 1274-1283; Blumenthal, K.G., Topaz, M., Zhou, L., Mining social media data to assess the risk of skin and soft tissue infections from allergen immunotherapy (2019) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 144 (1), pp. 129-134; Lott, J.P., Boudreau, D.M., Barnhill, R.L., Population-based analysis of histologically confirmed melanocytic proliferations using natural language processing (2018) JAMA Dermatol, 154 (1), pp. 24-29; Menzies, S., Daly, S., McKenna, D., Social media and psoriasis treatment: what are people saying on Twitter?

One of the practical difficulties in conducting OSCEs in dermatology is getting patients with typical skin lesions which can be used for the whole group to ensure uniformity of assessment. We present a study on the use of simple moulage techniques to create uniform and standardized skin lesions for OSCEs in dermatology. Methods: As a first step, the dermatology faculty in our department chose the clinical conditions which could be covered by using moulages. The main criteria considered were the importance of the condition to the exam blueprint, ease of making and resistance to handling (should not require frequent retouching). Moulages were created on volunteers after taking consent and the same were used in OSCEs s for a group of 5th-year students (N = 102). Difficulty and discrimination indices were compared between the stations using the moulage and the other stations. Qualitative feedback was obtained regarding the same from both the faculty and the students. Results: There was consensus among the faculty and the majority of the students that the lesions were clearly recognizable. As far as other psychometrics were concerned, average difficulty and discrimination of the stations using the moulage were good (average difficulty index - 0.78 and average discrimination index - 0.68) and compared favorably with the other stations (average difficulty index - 0.77 and average discrimination index - 0.57). Limitations: Limited number of stations included, lack of detailed item analysis and lack of feedback from the simulated patients were the main limitations in this study. Conclusion: For most common skin conditions creating moulages to simulate the corresponding lesions is an easy procedure and can be an effective tool to standardize dermatology OSCEs for undergraduates, especially in resource-poor settings. © 2020 Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology.","Assessment; dermatology; moulage; objective structured clinical examinations","cellophane; talc; Article; clinical assessment; clinical examination; dermatology; discriminant analysis; eczema; erythema; erythema multiforme; human; Likert scale; major clinical study; moulage; oral blister; pityriasis; psoriasis; psychometry; purpura; questionnaire; scabies; seborrheic keratosis; simulation; skin defect; skin disease; tinea corporis; tinea versicolor; training; treatment planning; undergraduate student; vitiligo",,"cellophane, 9005-81-6; talc, 14807-96-6",,,,,,,,"Worm, AM, Sinisalo, H, Eilertsen, G, Šhrén, E, Meyer, I., Dermatological moulage collections in the Nordic countries (2018) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 32, pp. 570-580; Kaliyadan, F, Khan, AS, Kuruvilla, J, Feroze, K., Validation of a computer based objective structured clinical examination in the assessment of undergraduate dermatology courses (2014) Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol, 80, pp. 134-136; Chaudhary, R, Grover, C, Bhattacharya, SN, Sharma, A., Computer assisted objective structured clinical examination versus objective structured clinical examination in assessment of dermatology undergraduate students (2017) Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol, 83, pp. 448-452; Grover, C, Bhattacharya, SN, Pandhi, D, Singal, A, Kumar, P., Computer assisted objective structured clinical examination: A useful tool for dermatology undergraduate assessment (2012) Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol, 78, p. 519; Saceda-Corralo, D, Fonda-Pascual, P, Moreno-Arrones, ÓM, Alegre-Sánchez, A, Hermosa-Gelbard, Á, Jiménez-Gómez, N, Objective structured clinical examination as an assessment tool for clinical skills in dermatology (2017) Actas Dermosifiliogr, 108, pp. 237-243; Kumar, GR, Madhavi, S, Karthikeyan, K, Thirunavakarasu, MR., Role of clinical images based teaching as a supplement to conventional clinical teaching in dermatology (2015) Indian J Dermatol, 60, pp. 556-561; Sabzwari, SR, Afzal, A, Nanji, K., Mimicking rashes: Use of moulage technique in undergraduate assessment at the aga khan university, Karachi (2017) Educ Health (Abingdon), 30, pp. 60-63; Zorn, J, Snyder, J, Guthrie, J., Use of moulage to evaluate student assessment of skin in an objective structured clinical examination (2018) J Physician Assist Educ, 29, pp. 99-103; Gormley, G, Menary, A, Layard, B, Hart, N, McCourt, C., Temporary tattoos: A novel objective structured clinical examination assessment tool (2013) Clin Teach, 10, pp. 251-257","Kaliyadan, F.; Department of Dermatology, Saudi Arabia; email: ferozkal@hotmail.com",,,"Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications",,,,,03786323,,IJDLD,"32769302","English","Indian J.

A further level of complexity opens up as soon as we look at diseases whose pathogenesis and therapy involve different immunological signaling pathways, which are potentially affected by COVID-19. Medical treatments must often be reassessed and questioned in connection with this infection. This article summarizes the current knowledge of COVID-19 in the light of major dermatological and allergological diseases. It identifies medical areas lacking sufficient data and draws conclusions for the management of our patients during the pandemic. We focus on common chronic inflammatory skin diseases with complex immunological pathogenesis: psoriasis, eczema including atopic dermatitis, type I allergies, autoimmune blistering and inflammatory connective tissue diseases, vasculitis, and skin cancers. Since several other inflammatory skin diseases display related or comparable immunological reactions, clustering of the various inflammatory dermatoses into different disease patterns may help with therapeutic decisions. Thus, following these patterns of skin inflammation, our review may supply treatment recommendations and thoughtful considerations for disease management even beyond the most frequent diseases discussed here. © 2020 The Authors.

Objective: To identify latent classes of children at risk for asthma exacerbation and determine whether latent class assignment is useful in the prediction of future exacerbation. Methods: Latent class analysis was performed on 513 children aged 6 to 17 years at risk for asthma exacerbation, with 31 variables encompassing demographics, medical history, treatment, symptoms, lung function, sensitization, and type 2 inflammation. Primary and secondary outcomes included exacerbation occurrence by 12 months and time to first exacerbation, respectively. Results: Four latent classes were identified with differing demographic features, sensitization and type 2 inflammatory markers, prior exacerbation severity and health care utilization, and lung function. Exacerbations occurred in 22.4% of class 1 (“lesser sensitization with normal lung function”), 27.9% of class 2 (“lesser sensitization with prior severe exacerbation and normal lung function”), 45.3% of class 3 (“multiple sensitization with reversible airflow limitation”), and 64.3% of class 4 (“multiple sensitization with partially reversible airflow limitation”) (P < .001). Time to exacerbation also followed similar trends and was shortest in the latent classes with multiple sensitization and airflow limitation (P < .001). Outcomes were driven largely by children with exacerbation-prone asthma (defined as ≥3 exacerbations in the prior year), who were present in each class but most strongly represented in classes 3 and 4. Conclusions: Children at risk for asthma exacerbation are a heterogeneous group. Sensitization, prior exacerbation severity, and lung function variables may be particularly useful in identifying children at greatest risk for future exacerbation. © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Aeroallergen sensitization; Asthma control; Asthma exacerbation; Asthma in children; Asthma outcomes; Latent class analysis; Lung function; Phenotype; Type 2 inflammation","beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; corticosteroid; immunoglobulin E; montelukast; omalizumab; adolescent; Article; asthma; child; controlled study; demography; disease exacerbation; disease severity; eczema; emergency care; eosinophil count; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; fractional exhaled nitric oxide; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; immunoglobulin blood level; intensive care unit; latent class analysis; major clinical study; male; pneumonia; quality of life; residual volume; sensitization; sinusitis; symptom; total lung capacity",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; montelukast, 151767-02-1, 158966-92-8; omalizumab, 242138-07-4",,,"Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, CHOA

It causes major physical and psychological burden for patients. Classification of CHE remains challenging because of its aetiological and clinical heterogeneity. Objectives: Using latent class analysis (LCA) on a large categorical data set, our aim was to identify distinct phenotypes in a cohort of unselected CHE patients based upon clinical, genetic, molecular and physical parameters of the affected skin. Methods: We performed two independent LCA on a cohort of 71 well-characterized patients that initially integrated clinical severity, total immunoglobulin E plasma level, transepidermal water loss, hydration index, interleukin(IL)-8 lesional skin level, Staphylococcus (aureus and epidermidis) colonization, FLG genotype and the expression (mRNA) of genes involved either in the filaggrin degradation and the natural moisturizing factor synthesis, the cornified envelope formation, the tight junctions’ structure and the desquamation process, or encoding antimicrobial peptides and chemokines. Results: The first LCA categorized patients into a group displaying high severity of CHE, high skin barrier impairment, high Staphylococcus colonization, high IL-8 skin level and high frequency of mutation in the FLG gene and a second group with opposite characteristics. The second LCA identified two independent groups of patients categorized by their low or high level of skin barrier impairment and corresponding changes in the expression of the related genes. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the degree of skin barrier dysfunction is the most important parameter to discriminate CHE patients and probably plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the disease whatever the aetiological factors. As far as we know, this is the first study to address this topic using a statistical categorization method without preconception. © 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",,"chemokine; DNA; filaggrin; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 8; messenger RNA; polypeptide antibiotic agent; adult; Article; bacterial colonization; clinical feature; cohort analysis; cutaneous parameters; desquamation; disease severity; DNA sequence; female; FLG gene; gene; gene expression; genetic analysis; genotype; hand eczema; human; hydration; immunoglobulin blood level; latent class analysis; major clinical study; male; moisture; mutation rate; pathogenesis; permeability barrier; phenotype; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; skin permeability; skin water loss; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis; tight junction",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; interleukin 8, 114308-91-7",,,"Les Laboratories Pierre Fabre","Funding source Study funded by Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosm?tique.

The Quality of Life in Hand Eczema Questionnaire (QOLHEQ) has been developed to measure impairment of health-related quality of life in patients with hand eczema. Objectives: To assess validity, reproducibility, responsiveness and interpretability of the Dutch version of the QOLHEQ. Methods: This was a prospective validation study in adult patients with hand eczema. At three time points (T0, baseline; T1, after 1–3 days; T2, after 4–12 weeks), data from the QOLHEQ and multiple reference instruments were collected. Scale structure was assessed using item response theory analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM). Single-score validity and responsiveness were tested with hypotheses on correlations with reference instruments. Concerning reproducibility, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCagreement) and standard error of agreement (SEMagreement) were checked. Regarding interpretability, bands for severity of quality-of-life impairment were proposed. Also, smallest detectable change (SDC) and minimally important change (MIC) were determined. Results: At T0, 300 individuals participated in the study (54% were male, mean age 45 years). Rescoring of the scale structure fitted the Rasch model and the SEM. The ICCagreement was 0·91 (95% confidence interval 0·85–0·94) and the SEMagreement was 5·2 points. Of the a priori formulated hypotheses, 80% (single-score validity) and 64% (change scores for responsiveness) were confirmed. The SDC was 14·4 points and the MIC was 11·5 points. Conclusions: The Dutch version of the QOLHEQ has a good structural validity and reproducibility and has a high single-score validity and moderate responsiveness. An improvement of ≥ 15 points should be regarded as a real, important change within the Dutch population. What's already known about this topic?. The Quality of Life in Hand Eczema Questionnaire (QOLHEQ) measures impairment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with hand eczema. The QOLHEQ was validated in Germany and Japan, but the validity and interpretability of the Dutch version are unknown. What does this study add?. This study shows that the Dutch QOLHEQ is a valid instrument to measure HRQoL impairment in Dutch patients with hand eczema, demonstrating good reliability and moderate responsiveness.

Objectives: The psychometric properties of a translated Chinese version of the Parental Self-Efficacy with Eczema Care Index (C-PASECI) were examined. Methods: The PASECI was translated in a 2-stage process involving both forward and backward translation. Subsequently, the psychometric properties of the C-PASECI were examined in a cohort of 147 Chinese parents or caregivers of children with eczema. Specifically, the internal consistency, 2-day test-retest reliability and construct validity were assessed. Results: The C-PASECI received a Cronbach's αof 0.97, and the intraclass correlation coefficients of each item ranged from 0.93 to 0.99. Negative correlations were observed among the C-PASECI, Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index and Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Scale scores, indicating the acceptable convergent validity of the C-PASECI. The moderate correlation observed between the C-PASECI and General Self-Efficacy Scale (Pearson's r = 0.53, p < 0.001) reflected the acceptable concurrent validity of the C-PASECI. The results of confirmatory factor analysis supported the factorial validity of the C-PASECI. Conclusion: The C-PASECI appears to be a reliable and valid measure of parental self-efficacy in Chinese parents or caregivers of children with eczema. © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Methods: We collected main clinical manifestation and auxiliary examination data during hospitalization to May 2019 from 35 OMDT patients with complete course record who were hospitalized from January 2014 to December 2018. Continuous monitoring indicators with changing trends including main clinical manifestation indicators, peripheral white blood cell counts, liver function indicators such as serum alanine aminotransferase activity, myocardial enzyme indicators such as serum lactate dehydrogenase activity were selected and used with their standardized values to do cluster analysis on time point (week as unit) of the course of each patient. The clustering results combined with changing trends of the indicators were used to determine the stages of course of each patient, and therefore the staging of general course of OMDT was calculated. Positive rates or average levels of the indicators were compared between different stages, and the correlation of duration of each stage was analyzed with physical characteristics, disease characteristics and treatment measures of the patients. Results: General course of OMDT could be divided into acute phase (3.0±1.5) weeks and chronic phase (11.0±4.4) weeks, while chronic phase could be further divided into early period (5.0±3.0) weeks and later period (6.5±3.7) weeks. Compared with chronic phase, clinical manifestation indicators, white blood cell counts (except eosinophil count) , liver function indicators (except total protein and albumin concentration) , and myocardial enzyme indicators were all increased (all P<0.01) , while total protein and albumin concentration decreased (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively) in acute phase. Compared with later period of the chronic phase, clinical manifestation indicators (except fever) , white blood cell counts (except lymphocyte count) , liver function indicators (except total protein and albumin concentration) , and creatine kinase isoenzyme activity were all increased (all P<0.01) , while total protein, albumin concentration and creatine kinase activity decreased (all P<0.01) . Duration of acute phase were positively correlated with the time before glucocorticoid treatment (r(spearman)=0.62, P(adjust)<0.01) , and early and later periods of chronic phase were both positively correlated with corresponding duration of glucocorticoid treatment (r(spearman)=0.96, P(adjust)<0.01, r(spearman)=0.91, P(adjust)<0.01, respectively) . Conclusion: For the first time, the study objectively determined stages of general course of OMDT based on combination of multiple indicators, and analyzed characteristics of main indicators in each phase and potential factors related to the duration of each phase.","Cluster analysis; Course of disease; Stage of disease; Trichloroethylene","trichloroethylene; human; leukocyte count; lymphocyte count; occupational eczema; serum; Dermatitis, Occupational; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Lymphocyte Count; Serum; Trichloroethylene",,"trichloroethylene, 79-01-6; Trichloroethylene",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,10019391,,,"32629578","Chinese","Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087737550

We examined the symptoms related to asthma and AD and the plasma levels of 72 cytokines/chemokines obtained from a general population of 161 children at 6 years of age who participated in a pilot birth cohort study of the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS). The children whose signs and symptoms fulfilled the criteria of AD, which are mostly based on questionnaire including past symptoms, tended to have higher levels of the two chemokine ligands, CCL17 and CCL27, which are used for diagnosis of AD. On the other hand, another AD-related chemokine CCL22 level in plasma was higher only in children with visible flexural eczema, which is one of AD diagnostic criteria but was judged on the same day of blood examination unlike other criteria. Here, we also developed an innovative method of machine learning for elucidating the complex cytokine/chemokine milieu related to symptoms of allergic diseases by using clustering analysis based on the random forest dissimilarity measure that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) technique. To our surprise, the majority of children showing at least any asthma-related symptoms during the last month were divided by AI into the two clusters, either cluster-2 having elevated levels of IL-33 (related to eosinophil activation) or cluster-3 having elevated levels of CXCL7/NAP2 (related to neutrophil activation), among the total three clusters. Future studies will clarify better approach for allergic diseases by endotype classification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Asthma; Atopic dermatitis; Child; Cohort study; Machine learning","chemokine; cutaneous T cell attracting chemokine; cytokine; macrophage derived chemokine; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; Article; artificial intelligence; asthma; atopic dermatitis; blood examination; child; clinical feature; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; eczema; exploratory research; female; human; leukocyte activation; machine learning; major clinical study; male; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor",,"thymus and activation regulated chemokine, 181532-29-6",,,"National Institute for Environmental Studies, NIES","The Japan Environment and Children's Study Pilot Study was funded by the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan.

We aimed to describe the characteristics of infants under 1 year of age (excluding newborns) with COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively retrieved data of 36 infants with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan Children’s Hospital from January 26 to March 22, 2020. Clinical features, chest imaging findings, laboratory tests results, treatments and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: The mean age of the infected infants was 6.43 months, with a range of 2–12 months. 61.11% of the patients were males and 38.89% females. 86.11% of the infants were infected due to family clustering. Cough (77.78%) and fever (47.22%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Chest CT scan revealed 61.11% bilateral pneumonia and 36.11% unilateral pneumonia. 47.22% of the infants developed complications. Increased leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and thrombocytes were observed in 11.11, 8.33, 36.11 and 44.44% of infants, respectively. Decreased leucocytes, neutrophils, thrombocyte and hemoglobin were observed in 8.33, 19.44, 2.78 and 36.11% of infants, respectively. Increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase and D-dimer were observed in 19.44, 67.74, 47.22, 19.44, 22.22 and 20.69% of infants, respectively. Only one infant had a high level of creatinine. Co-infections with other respiratory pathogens were observed in 62.86% of infants. CD3 (20.69%), CD4 (68.97%), CD19 (31.03%) and Th/Ts (44.83%) were elevated; CD8 (6.9%) and CD16+CD56 (48.28%) was reduced. IL-4 (7.69%), IL-6 (19.23%), IL-10 (50%), TNF-α (11.54%) and IFN-γ (19.23%) were elevated. Up to March 22, 97.22% of infants recovered, while a critical ill infant died. When the infant’s condition deteriorates rapidly, lymphocytopenia was discovered. Meanwhile, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, creatinine, IL-6 and IL-10 increased significantly. Conclusions: In the cohort, we discovered that lymphocytosis, elevated CD4 and IL-10, and co-infections were common in infants with COVID-19, which were different from adults with COVID-19. Most infants with COVID-19 have mild clinical symptoms and good prognosis. © 2020, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine.","Coronavirus infant infection; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","alanine aminotransferase; C reactive protein; CD16 antigen; CD19 antigen; CD3 antigen; CD4 antigen; CD56 antigen; CD8 antigen; creatine kinase; creatinine; D dimer; gamma interferon; hemoglobin; interleukin 10; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; procalcitonin; tumor necrosis factor; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; atelectasis; brain toxicity; China; cleft palate; clinical article; clinical feature; clinical outcome; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; creatine kinase blood level; creatinine blood level; disseminated intravascular clotting; eczema; epileptic state; erythema multiforme; female; heart atrium septum defect; heart muscle injury; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypothyroidism; immunoglobulin deficiency; infant; intussusception; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; leukocyte count; lymphocyte count; male; mixed infection; nausea and vomiting; neutrophil count; nose obstruction; pneumonia; respiratory alkalosis; retrospective study; septic shock; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thrombocyte; x-ray computed tomography; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; treatment outcome; virus pneumonia; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; creatine kinase, 9001-15-4; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A; procalcitonin, 56645-65-9",,,,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXhs1Kqu7c%3D; Xu, X.W., Wu, X.X., Jiang, X.G., Xu, K.J., Ying, L.J., Ma, C.L., Clinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series (2020) BMJ, 368, p. m606; Coronavirus Disease (COVID-2019) Situation Reports, , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200415-sitrep-86-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=c615ea20_6, April 15, 2020, .

Differences in prevalence of childhood eczema between countries and ethnicities suggest that genetic and early modifiable environmental factors, such as dietary intake, may underlie this observation. To investigate the association between pregnancy diet and infant eczema in a consortium of prospective Canadian birth cohorts predominantly comprised of white Europeans and South Asians. Methods We evaluated the association of maternal dietary patterns reported during pregnancy (assessed at 24–28 weeks gestation using a semi-quantitiative food-frequency questionnaire) with parent-reported physician-diagnosed infant eczema at 1-year from 2,160 mother-infant pairs. Using three dietary patterns (“Western”, “plant-based”, and “Balanced”) previously derived in this cohort using principal component analysis, we used multivariable logistic regression to determine the association of these dietary patterns with infant eczema, adjusted for potential confounders. Results We observed a lower odds of eczema in the full sample combining white Europeans and South Asians with greater adherence to a plant-based (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.76; <0.001) and Western dietary pattern (OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.89; P<0.01), after adjusting for other known predictors of eczema, including ethnicity, which was not significant. No associations were observed for the balanced diet. An interaction between the Western diet and ethnicity was observed (P<0.001). Following stratification by ethnicity, a protective association between the plant-based diet and infant eczema was confirmed in both white Europeans (OR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.74; P<0.001) and South Asians (OR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.97; P = 0.025). In white Europeans only, a Western diet was associated with a lower odds of infant eczema (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.87; P = 0.001) while a balanced diet increased the odds of infant eczema (OR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.49; P = 0.03). Beyond a plant-based diet, no significant associations with other dietary patterns were observed in South Asians. Conclusion A plant-based diet during pregnancy is associated with a lowered odds of infant eczema at 1 year in all participants. Future studies of the components of plant-based diet which underlie the lower risk of eczema are needed. © 2020 Zulyniak et al.

Objective: Our aim was to examine the differences in sensitization patterns at ages 5 years and 9 years to identify longitudinal changes in the degree and patterns of sensitization in a birth cohort of Japanese children. Methods: Our study enrolled 984 children at aged 5 years between 2008 and 2010, and 729 children aged 9 years between 2012 and 2014. Allergic diseases were assessed using the ISAAC and UK Working Party's Diagnostic Criteria. Serum-specific IgE titers to allergen components were measured by multiplex array ImmunoCAP ISAC when the children were aged 5 and 9 years. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to characterize IgE sensitization to allergen components. Results: The prevalence of allergic rhinitis increased considerably over time (10.6%–31.2%). Furthermore, the sensitization prevalence to allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) also increased from 57.8% at age 5 years to 74.8% at age 9 years. IgE sensitization prevalence to Der f 1 (mites) was 42.1% at age 5 years and 54.3% at age 9 years. Furthermore, children were highly sensitized to Cry j 1 (Japanese cedar) (32.8% at age 5 years and 57.8% at age 9 years). Principle component analysis showed that sensitization to PR-10 cross-reactive components was independent of sensitization to mite and that no children acquired sensitization to pollen before acquiring sensitization to mite. Conclusions: The prevalence of allergic rhinitis and related allergen components increased from age 5 years to age 9 years in Japanese children. © 2020 The Author(s)","Allergy; Asthma; Atopic dermatitis; Child; Cohort; Eczema; IgE; ISAAC; ISAC; Prospective birth cohort; Rhinitis; Sensitization; Wheeze","allergen; immunoglobulin E; allergic rhinitis; allergy; antibody titer; Article; child; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross reaction; disease classification; female; house dust allergy; human; immune response; immunoassay; Japan; Japanese cedar; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mite; parent; physical examination; pollen; preschool child; prevalence; principal component analysis; priority journal; questionnaire; school child; sensitization",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,"National Center for Child Health and Development, NCCHD: 26-18","This study was supported by a grant from the National Center for Child Health and Development (26-18) .",,,,"Pawankar, R., Allergic diseases and asthma: a global public health concern and a call to action (2014) World Allergy Organ J, 7 (1), p. 12; Futamura, M., Ohya, Y., Akashi, M., Age-related prevalence of allergic diseases in Tokyo schoolchildren (2011) Allergol Int, 60 (4), pp. 509-515; Yang, L., Narita, M., Yamamoto-Hanada, K., Sakamoto, N., Saito, H., Ohya, Y., Phenotypes of childhood wheeze in Japanese children: A group-based trajectory analysis (2018) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 29 (6), pp. 606-611; Matricardi, P.M., Kleine-Tebbe, J., Hoffmann, H.J., EAACI molecular allergology user's guide (2016) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 27, pp. 1-250; Skrindo, I., Lupinek, C., Valenta, R., The use of the MeDALL-chip to assess IgE sensitization: a new diagnostic tool for allergic disease?

Few data are available about AD phenotypes and their nationwide distribution. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional multicenter study involving some of the main Italian pediatric allergy centers from 9 Italian cities. A structured questionnaire was administered to 371 children with AD. Patients were divided in 2 groups: preschool children (aged ≤5 years) and schoolchildren (aged 6-14 years). A latent class analysis was used to detect AD phenotypes and to investigate their association with risk factors and other atopic diseases. Results: Latent class analysis identified 5 AD phenotypes in preschoolers (“moderate-severe AD, high comorbidity”, 8%; “moderate-severe AD, low comorbidity”, 35%; “mild AD, low comorbidity”, 20%; “mild AD, respiratory comorbidity”, 32%; “mild AD, food-induced comorbidity”, 5%) and 4 AD phenotypes in schoolchildren (“moderate-severe AD, high comorbidity”, 24%; “moderate-severe AD, low comorbidity”, 10%; “mild AD, low comorbidity”, 16%; “mild AD, respiratory comorbidity”, 49%). Parental history of asthma and eczema, early day-care attendance, and exposure to molds were significantly associated with the “moderate-severe AD, high comorbidity” phenotype in preschool children (P<.05). The “moderate-severe AD” phenotypes were also associated with the highest burden in terms of medication use and limitations in daily activities. Conclusions: The detection of different AD phenotypes highlights the need for a stratified approach to the management of this complex disease and for further studies to predict the course of AD and to develop more efficient therapeutic strategies. © 2020 Esmon Publicidad.","Atopic dermatitis; Environment and hygiene hypothesis; Epidemiology; Pediatrics; Quality of life","antibiotic agent; antifungal agent; antihistaminic agent; calcineurin inhibitor; corticosteroid; immunoglobulin E; adolescent; allergic asthma; allergic rhinitis; allergy; anaphylaxis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; comorbidity; conjunctivitis; cross-sectional study; disease association; disease severity; drug use; eczema; environmental factor; female; food allergy; hospital admission; human; latent class analysis; male; multicenter study; phenotype; preschool child; prick test; rhinoconjunctivitis; risk factor; school child; Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis; sleep quality; smoking; structured questionnaire; urticaria; wheezing",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,,"Silverberg, J.I., Thyssen, J.P., Paller, A.S., Drucker, A.M., Wollenberg, A., Lee, K.H., What's in a name?

Methods Youth (8-17 years) from clinical populations with known SDs (sleep clinic n126, autism n276, asthma n82, asthma eczema n68) and the general population (n902) completed the PROMIS Pediatric SD and SRI 8-item short forms, along with established measures of sleep (Children's Report of Sleep Patterns, Sleep Habits Survey), PROMIS Pediatric Fatigue, and parent-reported clinical indicators (does child have sleep problem, use melatonin, use prescription sleep medication). Results Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated factorial invariance for all clinical groups. Significant differences between the general population and clinical groups were found for SD and SRI (medium to large effect sizes). Convergent validity was demonstrated through separate hierarchical regression models that showed significant associations between parent-reported clinical indicators and SD and SRI, above and beyond clinical group, as well as moderate to strong correlations between the PROMIS sleep measures and both established measures of sleep and fatigue. Conclusions The PROMIS Pediatric SD and SRI short forms provide clinicians and researchers a brief, accurate, and valid way to measure patient-reported sleep outcomes in pediatric populations. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

The aim of this study was to investigate how maternal fish intake during pregnancy and levels of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) in the infant’s cord serum correlated with different subsets of B-and T-cells in cord blood and B-cell activating factor (BAFF) in cord plasma, and with doctor-diagnosed allergy at 3 and 8 years of age in the FARMFLORA birth-cohort consisting of 65 families. Principal component analysis showed that infant allergies at 3 or 8 years of age were negatively associated with the proportions of n-3 LCPUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid) in infant cord serum, which, in turn correlated positively with maternal fish intake during pregnancy. Both maternal fish intake and cord serum n-3 LCPUFAs correlated negatively to CD5+ B cells and the FOXP3+ CD25high of the CD4+ T cell subsets in cord blood, but not to BAFF in cord plasma. Our observational study suggests that fish might contain components that promote maturation of the infant’s immune system in a manner that protects against allergy development. © 2020 by the authors.

Objectives: To investigate further the cumulative effects of a range of n-propanol concentrations relevant at the workplace in healthy and atopic dermatitis (AD) individuals, and study the modulation of the outcomes by co-exposure and host-related factors. Methods: Healthy adult and AD volunteers were exposed to n-propanol concentrations from 30% to 75% in occlusion-modified tandem repeated irritation test with measurements of erythema, transepidermal water loss, capacitance, and the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) levels at baseline and after 96 hours. Results: n-Propanol exerted significant barrier damaging effects even at the lowest concentration in both groups. Exposure to all n-propanol concentrations significantly reduced the NMF levels. Preceding low-grade trauma by occlusion/water exposure reduced the skin irritation threshold in both groups. The differences in the severity of the barrier function impairment after exposure to the same concentrations under the same conditions between the AD and control groups were significant. Conclusions: The negative effects of cumulative exposure to n-propanol in healthy and atopic skin shown in the study suggest the need for critical re-evaluation of its irritant properties in vivo. © 2019 The Authors.

In order to uncover communalities between heterogeneous data, the data are often harmonized by constructing a kernel and perform numerical integration. In this study, we propose a method for data integration in the framework of an undirected graphical model, where the nodes represent individual data sources of varying nature in terms of complexity and underlying distribution and where the edges represent the partial correlations between two blocks of data. We propose a modified GLASSO for estimation of the graph, with a combination of cross-validation and extended Bayes Information Criterion for sparsity tuning. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering on the weighted consensus kernels from a fixed network is used to partitioning the samples into different classes. Simulations show increasing ability to uncover true edges with increasing sample size and signal to noise. Likewise, identification of nonexisting edges towards disconnected nodes is feasible. The framework is demonstrated for integration of longitudinal symptom burden data, from the second and third year of life, combined with 21 diseases precursors and information of the development of asthma and eczema at the age of 6 years, from 403 children from the COPSAC2010 mother-child cohort. This suggests that maternal predisposition as well as being born preterm indirectly lead to a higher risk of asthma via an increased respiratory symptom burden. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","dual-primal optimization; GLASSO; heterogeneous data integration; kernelization; undirected graphical models",,,,,,,,,,,"Aben, N., Westerhuis, J.A., Song, Y., Kiers, H.A., Michaut, M., Smilde, A.K., Wessels, L.F.A., iTOP: inferring the topology of omics data (2018) Bioinformatics, 34 (17), pp. i988-i996; Shawe-Taylor, J., Cristianini, N., (2004) Kernel Methods for Pattern Analysis, , Cambridge, Cambridge university press; Camps-Valls, G., Gómez-Chova, L., Muñoz-Marí, J., Rojo-Álvarez, J.L., Martínez-Ramón, M., Kernel-based framework for multitemporal and multisource remote sensing data classification and change detection (2008) IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens, 46 (6), pp. 1822-1835; Carroll, J.D., Chang, J.-J., Analysis of individual differences in multidimensional scaling via an n-way generalization of eckart-young decomposition (1970) Psychometrika, 35 (3), pp. 283-319; Robert, P., Escoufier, Y., A unifying tool for linear multivariate statistical methods: the rv-coefficient (1976) J R Stat Soc: Ser C (Appl Stat), 25 (3), pp. 257-265; Smilde, A.K., Kiers, H.A., Bijlsma, S., Rubingh, C.M., Van Erk, M., Matrix correlations for high-dimensional data: the modified rv-coefficient (2008) Bioinformatics, 25 (3), pp. 401-405; Foygel, R., Drton, M., (2010) Extended Bayesian information criteria for gaussian graphical models, pp. 604-612. , In Advances in neural information processing systems; de Rooi, J., Nørgaard, S.K., Rasmussen, M.A., Bønnelykke, K., Bisgaard, H., Smilde, A.K., Data representations and-analyses of binary diary data in pursuit of stratifying children based on common childhood illnesses (2018) PloS one, 13 (11); Bisgaard, H., Vissing, N.H., Carson, C.G., Deep phenotyping of the unselected COPSAC 2010 birth cohort study (2013) Clin Exp Allergy, 43 (12), pp. 1384-1394; Friedman, J., Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., Sparse inverse covariance estimation with the graphical lasso (2008) Biostatistics, 9 (3), pp. 432-441; Mazumder, R., Hastie, T., The graphical lasso: new insights and alternatives (2012) Electron J Stat, 6, p. 2125; Su, W., Bogdan, M., Candes, E., False discoveries occur early on the lasso path (2017) Ann Stat, 45 (5), pp. 2133-2150; Revai, K., Mamidi, D., Chonmaitree, T., Association of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization during upper respiratory tract infection and the development of acute otitis media (2008) Clin Infect Dis, 46 (4), pp. e34-e37; Sevelsted, A., Stokholm, J., Bønnelykke, K., Bisgaard, H., Cesarean section and chronic immune disorders (2015) Pediatrics, 135 (1), pp. e92-e98; Lux, A.L., Henderson, A.J., Pocock, S.J., Wheeze associated with prenatal tobacco smoke exposure: a prospective, longitudinal study (2000) Arch Dis Child, 83 (4), pp. 307-312; Lim, R.H., Kobzik, L., Dahl, M., Risk for asthma in offspring of asthmatic mothers versus fathers: A meta-analysis (2010) PloS one, 5 (4); Litonjua, A.A., Carey, V.J., Burge, H.A., Weiss, S.T., Gold, D.R., Parental history and the risk for childhood asthma: does mother confer more risk than father?

Methods: Data on breastfeeding, consumption of infant formula (regular, pre-/probiotics, partially hydrolysed with hypoallergenic label [pHF-HA], extensively hydrolysed [eHF], soya) and solid food introduction were collected using repeated questionnaires at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Infants with similar feeding practices over the first year of life were grouped using multidimensional longitudinal cluster analysis. Respiratory/allergic morbidity was studied at 8 years as symptoms, doctor's diagnoses (asthma, hay fever, eczema, food allergy), and measurement of lung function, FeNO and specific IgE. Associations between feeding-related clusters and respiratory/allergic morbidity were investigated using multivariable logistic and linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders including early respiratory/allergic outcomes and parental history of allergy. Results: Five clusters were identified among 3446 infants: Cluster 1 (45%) mainly fed with regular formula, Cluster 2 (27%) exclusively breastfed during the first 3 months, and three other clusters consuming different types of formula (pre-/probiotics for Cluster 3 [17%], pHF-HA for Cluster 4 [7%], eHF/soya for Cluster 5 [4%]). Compared to Cluster 1, children from Cluster 2 tended to have a lower risk of asthma and children from Cluster 4 had a significant lower lung function (FEV1, FVC), higher FeNO and higher risk of sensitization at 8 years. Conclusion: Early pHF-HA use was negatively associated with objective measures of respiratory/allergic morbidity at school age, while children breastfed for at least 3 months seem protected against asthma at 8 years old. © 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

However, the lack of attention on engagement aspects of mobile healthcare applications often result in users choosing to uninstall the application after the first usage experience. This results in failure of effective prolonged personalised healthcare, especially for users with chronic disease related to weather conditions such as asthma and eczema which require long-term monitoring and self-care. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the pattern of application user engagement with a weather-based mobile healthcare application through cohort retention analysis. Enhancement features for improving the engagement of personalised healthcare can provide meaningful insight. The proposed application allows the patient to conduct disease control tests to check the severity of their condition on a daily basis. To measure the application engagement, we distribute the mobile application designed for primary testing over a period of ten days. Based on the primary testing, data related to retention rate and the number of control test reported were collected via Firebase Analytic to determine the application engagement. Subsequently, we apply cohort analysis using a machine learning clustering technique implemented in Python to identify the pattern of the engagement by application users. Finally, useful insights were analysed and implemented as enhancement features within the application for improving the personalised weather-based mobile healthcare. The findings in this paper can assist machine learning facilitators design effective use policies for weather-based mobile healthcare with fundamental knowledge enhanced with personalisation and user engagement. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Intelligent management information systems; Mobile devices; Mobile intelligence; Personalisation; Weather based healthcare","Disease control; Diseases; Machine learning; Turing machines; Chronic disease; Cohort analysis; Health care application; Health condition; Long term monitoring; Mobile applications; Personalisation; Usage experience; mHealth",,,,,"FRGS/1/2019/SS06/MMU/02/4","Acknowledgments.

Such disease persistence cannot yet be predicted. The aim of the present study was to predict the natural course of AD using clinical parameters and serum proteins. Methods: Sera of 144 children with AD (age 0-3 years) were analyzed for IgE and 33 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Patient disease course until the age of 7 years was assessed retrospectively. Unsupervised k-means clustering was performed to define disease endotypes. Identified factors associated with AD persistence at the age of 7 years were validated in children with AD in an independent cohort (LISA Munich; n = 168). Logistic regression and XGBoosting methods followed by cross-validation were applied to predict individual disease outcomes. Results: Three distinct endotypes were found in infancy, characterized by a unique inflammatory signature. Factors associated with disease persistence were disease score (SCORAD), involvement of the limbs, flexural lesion distribution at the age of 3 years, allergic comorbidities, and disease exacerbation by the trigger factors stress, pollen exposure, and change in weather. Persistence was predicted with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 82.4%. Factors with a high impact on the prediction of persistence were SCORAD at the age of 3 years, trigger factors, and low VEGF serum levels. Conclusion: Atopic dermatitis in infancy comprises three immunological endotypes. Disease persistence can be predicted using serum cytokines and clinical variables. © 2020 The Authors.

We aimed to assess these trajectories and examine their associations with lung function outcomes and profiles of comorbidities. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, data for asthma and related allergic conditions (ie, eczema, hay fever, and food allergy) were prospectively collected from the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study for participants aged 7–53 years originally recruited in Tasmania, Australia. All surviving individuals in the database with contact details were invited in the most recent follow-up (mean age 53 years). There were no exclusion criteria. With use of latent class analysis, we identified longitudinal trajectories of asthma and allergic conditions from 7–53 years, and profiles of self-reported extrapulmonary conditions recorded at 53 years. The associations between asthma and allergy trajectories and morbidity profiles and lung function at 53 years were investigated with regression models. Findings: Between Sept 3, 2012, and Nov 8, 2016, of 6128 individuals invited, 3609 (58·9%) individuals were enrolled. We identified five asthma and allergy trajectories: minimal and least asthma and allergies (n= 1767 [49·0%]); late-onset hay fever, no asthma (n=1065 [29·5%]); early-onset remitted asthma and allergies (n=236 [6·5%]); late-onset asthma and allergies (n=317 [8·8%]); and early-onset persistent asthma and allergies (n=224 [6·2%]); and four profiles of extrapulmonary morbidities: minimal or least disease (n=2206 [61·1%]); dominant mental health disorders (n=861 [23·9%]); dominant cardiovascular diseases or risks (n=424 [11·7%]); and multiple disorders (n=117 [3·2%]). The late-onset asthma and allergies trajectory was predominantly associated with the multiple disorders profile (relative risk ratio 3·3 [95% CI 1·9–5·9]), whereas the other asthma and allergy trajectories were associated only with the dominant mental health disorders profile. Both spirometrically defined and clinical COPD were most strongly associated with the early-onset persistent asthma and allergies trajectory (odds ratio [OR] 5·3 [95% CI 3·2–8·6]) and also with the late-onset asthma and allergies trajectory (OR 3·8 [2·4–6·1]). Interpretation: Distinct longitudinal trajectories of asthma and allergic disease from childhood to 53 years are associated with different profiles of extrapulmonary comorbidities and varying risk of COPD. These findings can inform a personalised approach in clinical guidelines and management focusing on treatable traits. Comorbidity profiles are a new target for early identification and intervention.

An English-language version of an instrument assessing itch-related cognitions is needed since cognitions can contribute to a worsening of itch, and chronic itch is prevalent in English-speaking counties and internationally. Methods The German Itch Cognitions Questionnaire was translated into English, and cognitive interviewing was conducted to finalize item wording. Internal and test-retest reliability, item discrimination, responsiveness to change, and construct, convergent, and discriminant validity were assessed in a national sample of 137 individuals with chronic itch due to atopic dermatitis or psoriasis recruited online. Results Internal reliability was high with Cronbach's alphas of 0.93 for the Catastrophizing subscale and 0.88-0.90 for Coping. The Pearson's correlation assessing 1-month test-retest reliability for the Catastrophizing subscale was r = 0.62 and for the Coping subscale was r = 0.61. The corrected item-total correlation revealed that items were relatively consistent with the scores for the subscales (with correlations ranging from 0.58 to 0.79), indicating very good item discrimination. Results of factor analysis, convergent and discriminant, and responsiveness to change analyses provided evidence for validity. Conclusions This study showed good psychometric characteristics of the English version of the Itch Cognitions Questionnaire. We suggest that future studies investigate the use of the measure in clinical practice to assist with treatment planning and outcome assessment related to itch as well as address study limitations such as sampling and replication. © 2020 Weeks et al.

Current US recommendations endorse screening but are not cost-effective relative to other international strategies. Objective: To identify scenarios in which current early peanut introduction guidelines would be cost-effective. Design, Setting, and Participants: This simulation/cohort economic evaluation used microsimulations and cohort analyses in a Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of early peanut introduction with and without peanut skin prick test (SPT) screening in high-risk infants during an 80-year horizon from a societal perspective. Data were analyzed from April to May 2019. Exposures: High-risk infants with early-onset eczema and/or egg allergy underwent early peanut introduction with and without peanut SPT screening (100 000 infants per treatment strategy) using a dichotomous 8-mm SPT cutoff value (stipulated in the current US guideline). Main Outcomes and Measures: Cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), net monetary benefit, peanut allergic reactions, severe allergic reactions, and deaths due to peanut allergy. Results: In the simulated cohort of 200 000 infants and using the base case during the model horizon, a no-screening approach had lower mean (SD) costs ($13 449 [$38 163] vs $15 279 [$38 995]) and higher mean (SD) gain in QALYs (29.25 [3.28] vs 29.23 [3.30]) vs screening but resulted in more allergic reactions (mean [SD], 1.07 [3.15] vs 1.01 [3.02]), severe allergic reactions (mean [SD], 0.53 [1.66] vs 0.52 [1.62]), and anaphylaxis involving cardiorespiratory compromise (mean [SD], 0.50 [1.59] vs 0.49 [1.47]) per individual. In deterministic SPT sensitivity analyses at base-case sensitivity and specificity rates, screening could be cost-effective at a high disutility rate (the negative effect of a food allergic reaction) (76-148 days of life traded) for an at-home vs in-clinic reaction in combination with high baseline peanut allergy prevalence among infants at high risk for peanut allergy and not yet exposed to peanuts. If an equivalent rate and disutility of accidental and index anaphylaxis was assumed and the 8-mm SPT cutoff had 0.85 sensitivity and 0.98 specificity, screening was cost-effective at a peanut allergy prevalence of 36%. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest that the current screening approach to early peanut introduction could be cost-effective at a particular health utility for an in-clinic reaction, SPT sensitivity and specificity, and high baseline peanut allergy prevalence among high-risk infants. However, such conditions are unlikely to be plausible to realistically achieve.

Objectives: To identify eczema phenotypes during childhood, and their associations with early-life environmental and genetic factors. Methods: In this study of 5297 children from a multiethnic population-based prospective cohort study, phenotypes based on parent-reported physician-diagnosed eczema from age 6 months to 10 years were identified using latent class growth analysis. Information on environmental factors was obtained using postal questionnaires. Four filaggrin mutations were genotyped and a risk score was calculated based on 30 genetic variants. Weighted adjusted multinomial models were used for association analyses. Results: We identified the following five eczema phenotypes: never (76%), early transient (8%), mid-transient (6%) and late transient (8%) and persistent eczema (2%). Early transient and persistent eczema were most common in first-born children, those with a parental history of eczema, allergy or asthma and those with persistent wheezing [range of odds ratio (OR): 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07–1.74 and OR 3.38, 95%CI 1.95–5.85]. Early transient eczema was most common in male children only (OR 1·49, 95% CI 1·18–1·89). Children with late transient or persistent eczema were more often of Asian ethnicity (OR 2·04, 95% CI 1·14–3·65 and OR 3·08, 95% CI 1·34–7·10, respectively). Children with early, late transient and persistent eczema more often had a filaggrin mutation or additional risk alleles (range OR: 1.07, 95%CI 1.02–1.12 and OR 2.21, 95%CI 1.39–3.50). Eczema phenotypes were not associated with maternal education, breastfeeding, day care attendance and pet exposure. Conclusions: Five eczema phenotypes were identified in a multiethnic paediatric population with limited differences in risk profiles, except for sex and ethnicity. What's already known about this topic?. Two previous studies in longitudinal birth cohorts identified four and six different eczema phenotypes, predominantly in children of European ethnicity. What does this study add?. Five eczema phenotypes were identified in a multiethnic paediatric population using latent class growth analysis. Children with early transient and persistent eczema were most often first-born children and had persistent wheezing, filaggrin mutation or additional risk alleles. Previously known eczema risk factors had limited differentiating capabilities for eczema phenotypes, except for the association of early transient eczema with male children, and late transient and persistent eczema with Asian ethnicity. © 2019 The Authors.

Research to understand these phenotypes has previously been based on longitudinal wheeze patterns or hypothesis-driven observational criteria. The aim of this study was to use data-driven machine learning to identify asthma and wheeze phenotypes in children based on symptom and symptom history data, and, to further characterize these phenotypes. The study population included an asthma-rich population of twins in Sweden aged 9-15 years (n = 752). Latent class analysis using current and historical clinical symptom data generated asthma and wheeze phenotypes. Characterization was then performed with regression analyses using diagnostic data: lung function and immunological biomarkers, parent-reported medication use and risk-factors. The latent class analysis identified four asthma/wheeze phenotypes: early transient wheeze (15%); current wheeze/asthma (5%); mild asthma (9%), moderate asthma (10%) and a healthy phenotype (61%). All wheeze and asthma phenotypes were associated with reduced lung function and risk of hayfever compared to healthy. Children with mild and moderate asthma phenotypes were also more likely to have eczema, allergic sensitization and a family history of asthma. Furthermore, those with moderate asthma phenotype had a higher eosinophil concentration (β 0.21, 95%CI 0.12, 0.30) compared to healthy and used short-term relievers at a higher rate than children with mild asthma phenotype (RR 2.4, 95%CI 1.2-4.9). In conclusion, using a data driven approach we identified four wheeze/asthma phenotypes which were validated with further characterization as unique from one another and which can be adapted for use by the clinician or researcher. © 2019 Brew et al.

Our objective is to identify respiratory and allergic phenotypes from birth to 6 years of age, and to explore their environmental determinants, especially those related to the home environment. Data on respiratory and allergic health outcomes and domestic environmental exposure were collected for 935 mother–infant pairs from a longitudinal mother–child cohort based on mothers, included before 19 weeks of gestation in Brittany between 2002 and 2006. Information was obtained by self-administered questionnaires completed by parents at inclusion, delivery, and when the child was 2 and 6 years old. Kml3D clustering was used to describe profiles of children who shared similar trajectories of symptoms as phenotypes. Association with environmental determinants was estimated by polytomous logistic regression. Five phenotypes were identified: a reference group characterized by low symptom levels (31.1%), a transient cough phenotype (36.5%), an eczema/cough phenotype (12.3%), a wheeze/cough phenotype (11.8%), and finally a mixed phenotype (8.0%). The wheeze/cough profile was associated with postnatal exposure to glues used in renovation activities (aOR 2.3 [1.2–4.7]), and the mixed phenotype with postnatal exposure to paint (aOR 2.1 [1–4.5]). The phenotypes observed showed some consistencies with those seen in previous studies. Some exposures associated with respiratory/allergic phenotypes observed in this study are avoidable. If confirmed by further research including interventional trials, home-based environmental counseling could be a possible prevention target for primary care professionals. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"bleaching agent; glue; tobacco smoke; alcohol consumption; allergy; Article; asthma; child; coughing; eczema; environmental factor; female; home environment; human; infant; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; maternal age; newborn; phenotype; premature labor; questionnaire; rash; wheezing; abnormal respiratory sound; adult; adverse event; asthma; clinical trial; environmental exposure; France; hypersensitivity; multicenter study; phenotype; preschool child; prevalence; retrospective study; risk factor; Adult; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Female; France; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Phenotype; Prevalence; Respiratory Sounds; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,"Agence Nationale de Sécurité Sanitaire de l’Alimentation, de l’Environnement et du Travail, ANSES

Treatment adherence is crucial in symptom management and the effectiveness of eczema management. The Problematic Experiences of Therapy Scale (PETS) is used to assess adherence to treatment among children with eczema. Objective: This study examined the psychometric properties of the translated Chinese version of PETS (C-PETS) among parents and caregivers of children with eczema. Methods: PETS was translated into Chinese and data obtained from a convenience sample of 147 Chinese participants from a regional hospital in Hong Kong. Results: The internal consistency of C-PETS with a Cronbach’s α of 0.93 and good test-retest reliability with weighted Kappa ranging from 0.74 to 0.89 were obtained. Significant positive correlations were found among the C-PETS, Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (r = 0.25, p =.002), and Severity Grading of Atopic Dermatitis scores (r = 0.38, p =.001). A significant negative correlation was found between C-PETS and Chinese adaptation of Generic Self-Efficacy scale (r = −0.40, p =.001). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the data supported the structural validity of C-PETS. Conclusion: This study indicates that C-PETS is a reliable and valid measure to evaluate treatment adherence for Chinese parents and caregivers of children with eczema. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","child; Eczema; Problematic Experiences Of Therapy Scale; treatment adherence","antieczema agent; dermatological agent; adult; Article; caregiver; Dermatology Life Quality Index; eczema; female; Hong Kong; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; middle aged; parent; patient compliance; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; Problematic Experiences of Therapy Scale; Severity Grading of Atopic Dermatitis score; skin disease assessment; test retest reliability; adolescent; child; child parent relation; cross-sectional study; eczema; pathology; patient compliance; procedures; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; translating (language); young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Caregivers; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatologic Agents; Eczema; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parents; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translating; Treatment Adherence and Compliance; Young Adult",,"Dermatologic Agents",,,,,,,,"(2011) Management of atopic eczema in primary care, , http://www.sign.ac.uk, Edinburgh: SIGN,.

Our objective was to determine incidence rates of autoimmune disorders in allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis (ARC), atopic eczema and asthma, and to investigate for co-occurring patterns. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study (1990–2018) employing data extracted from The Health Improvement Network (UK primary care database). The exposure group comprised ARC, atopic eczema and asthma (all ages). For each exposed patient, up to two randomly selected age- and sex-matched controls with no documented allergic disease were used. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) were calculated using Poisson regression. A cross-sectional study was also conducted employing Association Rule Mining (ARM) to investigate disease clusters. Results: 782320, 1393570 and 1049868 patients with ARC, atopic eczema and asthma, respectively, were included. aIRRs of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren’s syndrome, vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, pernicious anaemia, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease and autoimmune thyroiditis were uniformly higher in the three allergic diseases compared with controls. Specifically, aIRRs of SLE (1.45) and Sjögren’s syndrome (1.88) were higher in ARC; aIRRs of SLE (1.44), Sjögren’s syndrome (1.61) and myasthenia (1.56) were higher in asthma; and aIRRs of SLE (1.86), Sjögren’s syndrome (1.48), vitiligo (1.54) and psoriasis (2.41) were higher in atopic eczema. There was no significant effect of the three allergic diseases on multiple sclerosis or of ARC and atopic eczema on myasthenia. Using ARM, allergic diseases clustered with multiple autoimmune disorders. Three age- and sex-related clusters were identified, with a relatively complex pattern in females ≥55 years old. Conclusions: The long-term risks of autoimmune disorders are significantly higher in patients with allergic diseases. Allergic diseases and autoimmune disorders show age- and sex-related clustering patterns.

Understanding genetic associations of specific patterns of symptoms might facilitate understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. Objective: To examine associations between allergic disease-related variants identified in a recent genome-wide association study and latent classes of allergic diseases (LCADs) in two population-based birth cohorts. Methods: Eight previously defined LCADs between birth and 11 years: “No disease,” “Atopic march,” “Persistent eczema and wheeze,” “Persistent eczema with later-onset rhinitis,” “Persistent wheeze with later-onset rhinitis,” “Transient wheeze,” “Eczema only” and “Rhinitis only” were used as the study outcome. Weighted multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate associations between 135 SNPs (and a polygenic risk score, PRS) and LCADs among 6345 individuals from The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Heterogeneity across LCADs was assessed before and after Bonferroni correction. Results were replicated in Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study (MAAS) (n = 896) and pooled in a meta-analysis. Results: We found strong evidence for differential genetic associations across the LCADs; pooled PRS heterogeneity P-value = 3.3 × 10−14, excluding “no disease” class. The associations between the PRS and LCADs in MAAS were remarkably similar to ALSPAC. Two SNPs (a protein-truncating variant in FLG and a SNP within an intron of GSDMB) had evidence for differential association (pooled P-values ≤ 0.006). The FLG locus was differentially associated across LCADs that included eczema, with stronger associations for LCADs with comorbid wheeze and rhinitis. The GSDMB locus in contrast was equally associated across LCADs that included wheeze. Conclusions and clinical relevance: We have shown complex, but distinct patterns of genetic associations with LCADs, suggesting that heterogeneous mechanisms underlie individual disease trajectories. Establishing the combination of allergic diseases with which each genetic variant is associated may inform therapeutic development and/or predictive modelling. © 2019 The Authors.

Phenotype studies of allergic diseases can facilitate the identification of risk factors and their underlying pathophysiology, resulting in the application of more effective treatment, selection of better treatment responses, and prediction of prognosis for each phenotype. In the early phase of phenotype studies in allergic diseases, artificial classifications were usually performed based on clinical features, such as triggering factors or the presence of atopy, which can result in the biased classification of phenotypes and limit the characterization of heterogeneous allergic diseases. Subsequent phenotype studies have suggested more diverse phenotypes for each allergic disease using relatively unbiased statistical methods, such as cluster analysis or latent class analysis. The classifications of phenotypes in allergic diseases may overlap or be unstable over time due to their complex interactions with genetic and encountered environmental factors during the illness, which may affect the disease course and pathophysiology. In this review, diverse phenotype classifications of allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and wheezing in children, allergic rhinitis, and atopy, are described. The review also discusses the applications of the results obtained from phenotype studies performed in other countries to Korean children. Consideration of changes in the characteristics of each phenotype over time in an individual’s lifespan is needed in future studies. © 2019 by The Korean Pediatric Society.","Allergic diseases; Child; Phenotype; Sensitization","serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 5; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; cluster analysis; disease course; eczema; human; immunoregulation; phenotype; quality of life; Review; sensitization; wheezing",,,,,"Chonnam National University, CNU","This study was financially supported by Chonnam National University.",,,,"Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis 2.0: From the clinical phenotype to the molecular taxonomy and stratified medicine (2012) Allergy, 67, pp. 1475-1482; Giavina-Bianchi, P., Defining phenotypes in rhinitis: A step toward personalized medicine (2015) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 135, pp. 151-152; Bieber, T., D'erme, A.M., Akdis, C.A., Traidl-Hoffmann, C., Lauener, R., Schäppi, G., Clinical phenotypes and endophenotypes of atopic dermatitis: Where are we, and where should we go?

The aim of the current study was to identify maternal pre-conception dietary components that may be associated with allergic disorders in children up to 3 years of age. Methods: Pregnant women attending their first antenatal visit and who were aged >18 years were invited to participate. Pre-conception food frequency data was retrospectively collected at 18 weeks’ gestation. Childhood eczema, current wheeze, and rhinitis was assessed at 36 months of age using a questionnaire and doctor diagnosis (n = 234). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to explore the combination of dietary food components that best discriminated between allergy status in children. Results: Maternal pre-conception food intake such as low and high fat dairy, fresh fruit, unsaturated spreads, and take-away foods, were protective for any allergy assessed. Non-oily fish was protective for eczema and current wheeze; saturated spreads (e.g., butter) was protective for eczema, current wheeze, and rhinitis; poultry and fruit juice were adversely associated with each allergy. Conclusions: Pre-conception food intakes demonstrate inconsistent and somewhat contrary relationships to the development of child allergies. Whether and how maternal food intake impacts the underlying fetal programming and the mechanisms of childhood allergy warrants further investigation. © 2019 by the authors.

Early life risk factors before the age of 10 years were assessed for the trajectories. Method: Members of the birth cohort (1989/90) were followed at age 1, 2, 4, 10, 18, and 26 years. Allergic sensitization and questionnaire data were collected. Spirometry tests were performed and evaluated according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria at 10, 18, and 26 years. To identify developmental trajectories for FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FEF25-75 from 10 to 26 years, a finite mixture model was applied to the longitudinal lung function data, separately for males and females. Associations of early life factors with the respective lung function trajectories were assessed using log-linear and logistic regression analyses. Results: Both high and low lung function trajectories were observed in men and women. FVC continued to grow beyond 18 years in men and women, whereas FEV1 peaked at age 18 years in female trajectories and in one male trajectory. For the FEV1/FVC ratios and FEF25-75 most trajectories appeared highest at age 18 and declined thereafter. However, the low FEV1/FVC trajectory in both sexes showed an early decline at 10 years. Lower birth weight was linked with lower lung function trajectories in males and females. Eczema in the first year of life was a risk factor for later lung function deficits in females, whereas the occurrence of asthma at 4 years of age was a risk factor for later lung function deficits in males. A positive skin prick test at age four was a risk for the low FEV1 trajectory in females and for the low FEV1/FVC trajectory in males. Conclusion: Men and women showed distinctive lung function trajectories and associated risk factors. Lower lung function trajectories can be explained by not achieving maximally attainable function at age 18 years and by a function decline from 18 to 26 years. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"adolescent; adult; Article; asthma; birth weight; child; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; forced expiratory flow; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; illness trajectory; logistic regression analysis; lung function; male; prick test; questionnaire; risk factor; school child; sensitization; sex difference; spirometry; young adult; age; asthma; follow up; growth, development and aging; longitudinal study; lung; lung function test; maximal expiratory flow; pathophysiology; physiology; risk factor; vital capacity; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Asthma; Child; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Lung; Male; Maximal Expiratory Flow Rate; Respiratory Function Tests; Risk Factors; Vital Capacity; Young Adult",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: R01 AI091905

Atopy might reflect various conditions differing in their susceptibility to environmental factors. Objective: We sought to define phenotypes of atopic sensitization in early childhood and examine their association with allergic diseases and hereditary background in Finland and Estonia. Methods: The analysis included 1603 Finnish and 1657 Estonian children from the DIABIMMUNE multicenter young children cohort. Specific IgE levels were measured at age 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, and categorized into 3 CAP classes. Latent class analysis was performed with the statistical software package poLCA in R software. Results: Both populations differed in terms of socioeconomic status and environmental determinants, such as pet ownership, farm-related exposure, time spent playing outdoors, and prevalence of allergic diseases (all P <.001). Nevertheless, we found similar latent classes in both populations: an unsensitized class, a food class, 2 inhalant classes differentiating between seasonal and perennial aeroallergens, and a severe atopy class. The latter was characterized by high total and specific IgE levels and strongly associated with wheeze (odds ratio [OR], 5.64 [95% CI, 3.07-10.52] and 4.56 [95% CI, 2.35-8.52]), allergic rhinitis (OR, 22.4 [95% CI, 11.67-44.54] and 13.97 [95% CI, 7.33-26.4]), and atopic eczema (OR, 9.39 [95% CI, 4.9-19.3] and 9.5 [95% CI, 5.2-17.5] for Finland and Estonia, respectively). Environmental differences were reflected in the larger seasonal inhalant atopy class in Finland, although composition of classes was comparable between countries. Conclusion: Despite profound differences in environmental exposures, there might exist genuine patterns of atopic sensitization. The distribution of these patterns might determine the contribution of atopic sensitization to disease onset. © 2019 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","allergy; atopy; diabetes type 1 risk; Estonia; Finland; IgE; Latent class analysis; severe atopy; unsupervised clustering; wheezing","immunoglobulin E; allergen; immunoglobulin E; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; Article; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; disease association; eczema; environmental exposure; Estonia; female; Finland; human; latent class analysis; major clinical study; male; pet animal; preschool child; prevalence; priority journal; sensitization; social status; wheezing; air pollutant; blood; clinical trial; cohort analysis; immediate type hypersensitivity; immunization; immunology; lifestyle; multicenter study; phenotype; pollen; season; socioeconomics; Air Pollutants; Allergens; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Estonia; Female; Finland; Humans; Hypersensitivity, Immediate; Immunization; Immunoglobulin E; Life Style; Male; Phenotype; Pollen; Prevalence; Seasons; Socioeconomic Factors",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Air Pollutants; Allergens; Immunoglobulin E",,,"Helsingin Yliopisto

The long-term clinical course of asthma phenotypes defined by clustering analysis remains unknown, although it is a key aspect to underpin their clinical relevance. We aimed to estimate risk of poor asthma events between asthma clusters identified 20 years earlier. Methods: The study relied on two cohorts of adults with asthma with 20-year follow-up, ECRHS (European Community Respiratory Health Survey) and EGEA (Epidemiological study on Genetics and Environment of Asthma). Regression models were used to compare asthma characteristics (current asthma, asthma exacerbations, asthma control, quality of life, and FEV1) at follow-up and the course of FEV1 between seven cluster-based asthma phenotypes identified 20 years earlier. Results: The analysis included 1325 adults with ever asthma. For each asthma characteristic assessed at follow-up, the risk for adverse outcomes differed significantly between the seven asthma clusters identified at baseline. As compared with the mildest asthma phenotype, ORs (95% CI) for asthma exacerbations varied from 0.9 (0.4 to 2.0) to 4.0 (2.0 to 7.8) and the regression estimates (95% CI) for FEV1% predicted varied from 0.6 (−3.5 to 4.6) to −9.9 (−14.2 to −5.5) between clusters. Change in FEV1 over time did not differ significantly across clusters. Conclusion: Our findings show that the long-term risk for poor asthma outcomes differed between comprehensive adult asthma phenotypes identified 20 years earlier, and suggest a strong tracking of asthma activity and impaired lung function over time. © 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

We aim to identify and characterize profiles based on the time course, severity, and apparent triggers of respiratory/allergy symptoms in school-aged children. Methods: Data on occurrence, severity, and triggers of asthma, rhinitis, and dermatitis symptoms were collected annually during the follow-up of the PARIS birth cohort. Children with similar symptom trajectories until 8-9 years were grouped into profiles using multidimensional (all symptoms considered simultaneously) cluster analysis. Associations between profiles and different health outcomes were analyzed using logistic or linear regression models. Results: Six distinct symptomatic profiles were identified. A profile was defined by persistent dermatitis symptoms, associated with sensitization to food and aeroallergens. Two profiles were characterized by wheezing: one with early transient wheezing and the other with persistent wheezing related to doctor-diagnosed asthma, airway obstruction, and perennial aeroallergen sensitization. Three profiles were characterized by rhinitis symptoms: one non-allergic and two allergic, either with persistent rhinitis symptoms related to allergic multimorbidity and sensitization to perennial aeroallergens, or with late-onset symptoms, related to both pollen and perennial aeroallergens sensitization as well as low lung function. Conclusion: This study brings further insights into the developmental profiles of respiratory/allergic outcomes from birth to school age. The identified profiles clearly differed regarding objective features such as diagnosed morbidity, sensitization, or lung function measurements, thus highlighting their biologic and clinical relevance. Allergic rhinitis profiles deserve particular attention, since they were likely to be involved in multimorbidity patterns. © 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

The aim of this study was to make a step beyond the hygiene hypothesis and to comprehensively classify these patterns with latent class analysis (LCA). A second aim was to characterize the classes by associations with immunological, clinical, and sociodemographic variables. Methods: LCA was applied to data from the CoLaus|PsyCoLaus study (N = 4874, age range 35-82 years) separately for men and women. It was based on survey information on chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella, herpes simplex, pertussis, scarlet fever, hay fever, asthma, eczema, urticaria, drug allergy, interparental violence, parental maltreatment, and trauma in early childhood. Subsequently, we examined how immune-mediated classes were reflected in leukocyte counts, inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, hsCRP), chronic inflammatory diseases, and mental disorders, and how they differed across social classes and birth cohorts. Results: LCA results with five classes were selected for further analysis. Latent classes were similar in both sexes and were labeled according to their associations as neutral, resilient, atopic, mixed (comprising infectious and atopic diseases), and ACE class. They came across with specific differences in biomarker levels. Mental disorders typically displayed increased lifetime prevalence rates in the atopic, the mixed, and the ACE classes, and decreased rates in the resilient class. The same patterns were apparent in chronic inflammatory diseases, except that the ACE class was relevant specifically in women but not in men. Conclusions: This is the first study to systematically determine immune-mediated classes that evolve early in life. They display characteristic associations with biomarker levels and somatic and psychiatric diseases occurring later in life. Moreover, they show different distributions across social classes and allow to better understand the mechanisms beyond the changes in the prevalence of chronic somatic and psychiatric diseases. © 2019 The Author(s).","Biomarkers; Chronic diseases; Hygiene hypothesis; Immune system; Latent class analysis; Mental disorders","C reactive protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor; adult; aged; Article; asthma; chickenpox; childhood injury; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug hypersensitivity; eczema; female; herpes simplex; human; hygiene hypothesis; inflammatory disease; information processing; interparental violence; latent class analysis; leukocyte count; male; measles; mental disease; mumps; pertussis; pollen allergy; population research; prevalence; prospective study; risk factor; rubella; scarlet fever; urticaria; violence; asthma; child; communicable disease; comorbidity; complication; immunity; immunology; inflammation; latent class analysis; middle aged; multiple chronic conditions; physiology; questionnaire; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asthma; Child; Communicable Diseases; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Hygiene Hypothesis; Immune System Phenomena; Inflammation; Latent Class Analysis; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Chronic Conditions; Prevalence; Surveys and Questionnaires",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4",,,,,,,,"Barabasi, A.L., Network medicine - From obesity to the ""diseasome (2007) N Engl J Med, 357, pp. 404-407. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2sXotFCqu7w%3D; Bilbo, S.D., Schwarz, J.M., The immune system and developmental programming of brain and behavior (2012) Front Neuroendocrinol, 33, pp. 267-286. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XhsVWmsr%2FI; Torow, N., Hornef, M.W., The neonatal window of opportunity: Setting the stage for life-long host-microbial interaction and immune homeostasis (2017) J Immunol, 198, pp. 557-563. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2sXhtFWrsLw%3D; Rook, G.A.W., Lowry, C.A., Raison, C.L., Hygiene and other early childhood influences on the subsequent function of the immune system (2015) Brain Research, 1617, pp. 47-62. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXms1Gjsr4%3D; Bloomfield, S.F., Rook, G.A., Scott, E.A., Shanahan, F., Stanwell-Smith, R., Turner, P., Time to abandon the hygiene hypothesis: New perspectives on allergic disease, the human microbiome, infectious disease prevention and the role of targeted hygiene (2016) Perspect Public Health, 136, pp. 213-224; Pfefferle, P.I., Renz, H., Microbial exposure and onset of allergic diseases - Potential prevention strategies?

Self-reported data are widely used in studies of wet work although the validity of these remains uncertain. The objective of the present study is to provide information on validity of self-reported wet work exposure in different professions by comparing work place observations with self-reported data. Methods: 114 workers from 15 various wet work professions were observed. The observations covered duration and frequency of wet work activities. The observed population as well as a non-observed population from each work place were given a questionnaire covering the same wet work activities. Results: Correspondence analysis between self-reported and observed wet work showed that misclassification was larger regarding duration than frequency. 29.2% overestimated and 23.9% underestimated total wet work with more than 2 h/day. Professions with high wet work prevalence overestimated duration of wet work activities, but underestimated frequency. Females overestimated frequency, but not duration. The observed group (45%) significantly more often, than the non-observed group (32%), reported having more than 2 h of wet work/day (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.6–4.9). Sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire regarding total wet work in the observed population showed 51% sensitivity and 59% specificity. Conclusion: Over- and underestimation of wet work were found to be equally distributed. The correspondence analyses illustrate a noticeable misclassification between the estimations and the observations on all wet work variables, but largest for total wet work. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Exposure; Observational study; Occupational dermatitis; Occupational hand eczema; Questionnaire; Wet work","water; adult; behavioral observation; Denmark; female; hand disinfection; human; male; middle aged; occupational exposure; prevalence; protective glove; questionnaire; reproducibility; self report; workplace; Adult; Behavior Observation Techniques; Denmark; Female; Gloves, Protective; Hand Disinfection; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Prevalence; Reproducibility of Results; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Water; Workplace",,"water, 7732-18-5; Water",,,,"Funding This study is an independent research and funded by The Danish",,,,"Anveden, I., Meding, B., Skin exposure in geriatric care—a comparison between observation and self-assessment of exposure (2007) Contact Dermat, 57, pp. 253-258; Anveden, I., Lidén, C., Alderling, M., Meding, B., Self-reported skin exposure—validation of questions by observation (2006) Contact Dermat, 55, pp. 186-191; Anveden, I., Wrangsjö, K., Järvholm, B., Meding, B., Self-reported skin exposure—a population-based study (2006) Contact Dermat, 54, pp. 272-277; Behroozy, A., Keegel, T.G., Wet-work exposure: a main risk factor for occupational hand dermatitis (2014) Saf Health Work, 5, pp. 175-180; Carøe, T.K., Ebbehøj, N., Agner, T., A survey of exposures related to recognized occupational contact dermatitis in Denmark in 2010 (2013) Contact Dermat, 70, pp. 56-62; Carøe, T.K., Ebbehøj, N.E., Agner, T., Occupational dermatitis in hairdressers—influence of individual and environmental factors (2017) Contact Dermat, 76, pp. 146-150; Diepgen, T.L., Coenraads, P.J., The epidemiology of occupational contact dermatitis (1999) Int Arch Occup Environ Health, 72, pp. 496-506; Diepgen, T.L., Andersen, K.E., Chosidow, O., Guidelines for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of hand eczema (2015) J Dtsch Dermatol Ges, 13, pp. e1-e22; Dulon, M., Kähler, B., Kirvel, S., Usage of gloves for hair shampooing in German hairdressing salons (2015) J Occup Med Toxicol, 10, pp. 1-5; Flyvholm, M.A., Lindberg, M., OEESC-2005—summing up on the theme irritants and wet work (2006) Contact Dermat, 55, pp. 317-321; Risk resulting from skin contact—determination, evaluation, measures (2008) Technical Rules for Hazardous Substances, , http://www.baua.de/nn_54598/en/Topics-from-A-to-Z/Hazardous-Substances/TRGS/pdf/TRGS-401.pdf; Hamnerius, N., Svedman, C., Bergendorff, O., Wet work exposure and hand eczema among healthcare workers: a cross-sectional study (2018) Br J Dermatol, 178, pp. 452-461; Ibler, K.S., Jemec, G.B.E., Agner, T., Exposures related to hand eczema: a study of healthcare workers (2012) Contact Dermat, 66, pp. 247-253; Jungbauer, F.H.W., Lensen, G.J., Groothoff, J.W., Coenraads, P.J., Exposure of the hands to wet work in nurses (2004) Contact Dermat, 50, pp. 225-229; Jungbauer, F.H.W., Van Der Harst, J.J., Schuttelaar, M.L., Characteristics of wet work in the cleaning industry (2004) Contact Dermat, 51, pp. 131-134; Meding, B.B., Validity of self-reports of hand eczema (2001) Contact Dermat, 45, pp. 99-103; Meding, B., Anveden Berglind, I., Alderling, M., Water exposure—challenging differences between occupations (2016) Contact Dermat, 74, pp. 22-28; (2010), http://olddata.arbejdsmiljoforskning.dk/NationaleData/NAK2005/vejledning/metode.aspx?lang=da; Nielsen, J., The hands among female cleaners (1996) Contact Dermat, 34, pp. 284-291; Skoet, R., Olsen, J., Mathiesen, B., A survey of occupational hand eczema in Denmark (2004) Contact Dermat, 51, pp. 159-166; Smit, H.A., Van Rijssen, A., Vandenbroucke, J.P., Coenraads, P.J., Susceptibility to and incidence of hand dermatitis in a cohort of apprentice hairdressers and nurses (1994) Scand J Work Environ Heal, 20, pp. 113-121; Susitaival, P., Flyvholm, M.A., Meding, B., Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ-2002): a new tool for surveying occupational skin diseases and exposure (2003) Contact Dermat, 49, pp. 70-76; Visser, M.J., Verberk, M.M., van Dijk, F.J.H., Wet work and hand eczema in apprentice nurses; part I of a prospective cohort study (2014) Contact Dermat, 70, pp. 44-55; Weistenhöfer, W., Wacker, M., Bernet, F., Occlusive gloves and skin conditions: is there a problem?

Objectives: We sought to identify severe bronchiolitis profiles using a clustering approach and to investigate for the first time their association with allergy/inflammatory biomarkers, nasopharyngeal microbiota, and development of recurrent wheezing by age 3 years. Methods: We analyzed data from a prospective, 17-center US cohort study of 921 infants (age <1 year) hospitalized with bronchiolitis (2011-2014 winters) with posthospitalization follow-up. Severe bronchiolitis profiles at baseline (hospitalization) were determined by using latent class analysis based on clinical factors and viral etiology. Blood biomarkers and nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles were determined by using samples collected within 24 hours of hospitalization. Recurrent wheezing by age 3 years was defined based on parental report of breathing problem episodes after discharge. Results: Three severe bronchiolitis profiles were identified: profile A (15%), which was characterized by a history of breathing problems/eczema during infancy and non–respiratory syncytial virus (mostly rhinovirus) infection; profile B (49%), which has the largest probability of respiratory syncytial virus infection and resembled classic respiratory syncytial virus-induced bronchiolitis; and profile C (36%), which was composed of the most severely ill group. Profile A infants had higher eosinophil counts, higher cathelicidin levels, and increased proportions of Haemophilus-dominant or Moraxella-dominant microbiota profiles. Compared with profile B, we observed significantly increased risk of recurrent wheezing in children with profile A (hazard ratio, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.90-3.68) and, to a lesser extent, with profile C (hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.14-2.01). Conclusion: Although longer follow-up is needed, our results might help identify, among children hospitalized for bronchiolitis, subgroups with particularly increased risk of asthma. © 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","asthma; cluster analysis; respiratory syncytial virus; Respiratory tract infections; rhinovirus","25 hydroxyvitamin D; antibiotic agent; cathelicidin; cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL 37; corticosteroid; immunoglobulin E; montelukast; Adenoviridae; Article; breathing rate; bronchiolitis; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; coughing; disease association; disease course; disease severity; eosinophil count; female; follow up; gene sequence; hospital admission; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; Human bocavirus; Human metapneumovirus; Human parainfluenza virus 3; immune response; innate immunity; latent class analysis; length of stay; major clinical study; male; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory syncytial virus infection; structured interview; wheezing; abnormal respiratory sound; asthma; bronchiolitis; immunology; infant; microbiology; microflora; nasopharynx; risk factor; virology; Asthma; Bronchiolitis; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Microbiota; Nasopharynx; Respiratory Sounds; Risk Factors",,"25 hydroxyvitamin D, 64719-49-9; cathelicidin, 170006-50-5; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; montelukast, 151767-02-1, 158966-92-8",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

NIH/NHLBI AsthmaNet","Background: Recurrent preschool wheezing is a heterogeneous disorder with significant morbidity, yet little is known about phenotypic determinants and their impact on clinical outcomes. Objective: Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify latent classes of recurrent preschool wheeze and their association with future exacerbations and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment response. Methods: Data from 5 clinical trials of 1708 children aged 12 to 71 months with recurrent wheezing were merged. LCA was performed on 10 demographic, exposure, and sensitization variables to determine the optimal number of latent classes. The primary outcome was the annualized rate of wheezing exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids during the study intervention period; the secondary outcome was the time to first exacerbation. Exploratory analyses examined the effect of daily ICS treatment on exacerbation outcomes. Results: Four latent classes of recurrent wheezing were identified; these were not distinguished by current symptoms or historical exacerbations but differed with regard to allergen sensitization and/or exposures. Annualized exacerbation rates (mean ± SEM/year) were 0.65 ± 0.06 for class 1 (“minimal sensitization”), 0.93 ± 0.10 for class 2 (“sensitization with indoor pet exposure”), 0.60 ± 0.07 for class 3 (“sensitization with tobacco smoke exposure”), and 0.81 ± 0.10 for class 4 (“multiple sensitization and eczema”) (P <.001). In a research setting of high adherence, daily ICS treatment improved exacerbation rates in classes 2 and 4 but not the other groups. Conclusions: Sensitization and exposure assessments are useful in the prediction of future exacerbation and may identify children most likely to respond favorably to daily ICS treatment. © 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Asthma exacerbation; Asthma in children; Inhaled corticosteroid; Latent class analysis; Phenotype; Preschool child; Sensitization; Type 2 inflammation; Wheeze","azithromycin; corticosteroid; leukotriene receptor blocking agent; corticosteroid; allergenicity; Article; child; controlled study; demography; disease course; drug effect; eczema; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; passive smoking; patient compliance; patient identification; population exposure; prediction; recurrent disease; sensitization; treatment outcome; treatment response; wheezing; abnormal respiratory sound; clinical trial; complication; crossover procedure; disease exacerbation; hypersensitivity; infant; latent class analysis; multicenter study; phenotype; preschool child; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Child, Preschool; Cross-Over Studies; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Infant; Latent Class Analysis; Male; Phenotype; Respiratory Sounds",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; Adrenal Cortex Hormones",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

The skin pigmentation of human beings varies from person to person and human skin type can be dry, oily, or combination. Such a variety in the human skin provides a diversified habitat for bacteria and other microorganisms. Melanocytes in the human skin, produces melanin which can absorb harmful ultraviolet radiation from sunlight which can damage the skin and result in skin cancer. The necessary tools needed for early detection of these diseases are still not a reality in most third world communities. If the symptoms of skin diseases such as acne, dermatomyositis, candidiasis, cellulitis, Scleroderma, chicken pox, ringworm, eczema, psoriasis, etc. are left untreated in its early stage then they can result in numerous health complications and even death. Image segmentation is a technique which aids with the detection of these skin diseases. In this paper, image processing techniques like adaptive thresholding, edge detection, K-means clustering and morphology-based image segmentation have been used to identify the skin diseases from the given image set. The acquired image set was pre-processed by deblurring, noise reduction and then processed.

Methods: A person-oriented approach (hierarchical cluster analysis) was used to identify cluster groups of individuals sharing participation patterns in the outcome variables frequency perceived importance in domestic life and peer relations. Cluster groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: A nine-cluster solution was chosen. All clusters included adolescents with impairment and long-term health conditions. Perceived importance of peer relations was more important than frequent attendance in domestic-life activities. Frequency of participation in dialogues and family interaction patterns seemed to affect the participation profiles more than factors related to body functions. Conclusion: Type of impairment or long-term health condition is a weaker determinant of membership in clusters depicting frequency and perceived importance in domestic life or peer relations than dialogue and family environment. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © 2018 Frida Lygnegård, Lena Almqvist, Mats Granlund, Karina Huus.","cluster analysis; everyday functioning; ICF-CY; Participation pattern; person-oriented method","adolescent; allergic rhinitis; anxiety disorder; Article; asthma; attention deficit disorder; autism; child; cluster analysis; communication disorder; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dyscalculia; dyslexia; eczema; environmental factor; epilepsy; female; heart atrium septum defect; human; indigestion; intellectual impairment; life; major clinical study; male; obesity; peer group; physical disease; priority journal; social participation; chronic disease; daily life activity; family relation; handicapped child; psychology; quality of life; Activities of Daily Living; Adolescent; Child; Chronic Disease; Disabled Children; Family Relations; Female; Humans; Male; Peer Group; Quality of Life; Social Participation",,,,,"Forskningsrådet om Hälsa, Arbetsliv och Välfärd, FORTE

Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify primary causative agents of bacteremia in pediatric and adolescent patients and associated risk factors. We hypothesized that these would be different than those seen in adults. Patients and Methods: This retrospective cohort, epidemiologic evaluation included patients admitted to a tertiary referral center from January 01, 2013, to December 31, 2015. Patients <18 years old with a confirmed positive blood culture were included; the first positive culture per organism per patient was analyzed. The primary outcome was to determine the most frequent causative organisms of bacteremia; the secondary outcome was an evaluation of risk factors for acquiring staphylococcal bacteremia. Results: A total of 913 isolates were evaluated, including 92 unique organisms. The most frequently identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis (238/913, 26.1%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (136/913, 14.9%). Methicillin resistance was observed in 60.3% of S aureus. Two hundred thirty-six patients were included in the risk factor analysis. Prematurity, previous antibiotics, and intubation/ventilation were more likely associated with S epidermidis (P <.001, P <.001, and P =.032, respectively). Patients with a recent or previous hospitalization and those with dermatitis/eczema were statistically more likely to grow S aureus (P <.001, P =.029, respectively). Conclusions: Although epidemiology of organisms associated with pediatric and adolescent bacteremia was similar to adults, risk factors were different than seen in that population.

Its presentation is similar to leprosy, and the differential diagnosis is not always easy. In VL endemic rural areas of Bihar, India, both infectious diseases co-exist. This observational study aimed to determine the prevalence and distribution of both conditions in an area that had until recently been highly endemic for VL. Methods We conducted a door-to-door survey in an area that belongs to the Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS) of Muzaffarpur, Bihar, India. Within the HDSS we selected the villages that had reported the highest numbers of VL cases in preceding years. All consenting household members were screened for skin conditions, and minor conditions were treated on the spot. Upon completion of screening activities at the level of a few villages, a dermatology clinic (“skin camp”) was conducted to which suspect leprosy and PKDL patients and other patients with skin conditions requiring expert advice were referred. We studied the association between distance from an index case of leprosy and the probability of disease in the neighborhood by fitting a Poisson model. Results We recorded a population of 33,319, out of which 25,686 (77.1%) were clinically screened. Participation in skin camps was excellent. Most common conditions were fungal infections, eczema, and scabies. There were three PKDL patients and 44 active leprosy patients, equivalent to a prevalence rate of leprosy of 17.1 per 10,000. Two out of three PKDL patients had a history of VL. Leprosy patients were widely spread across villages, but within villages, we found strong spatial clustering, with incidence rate ratios of 6.3 (95% C.I. 1.9–21.0) for household members and 3.6 (95% C.I. 1.3–10.2) for neighbors within 25 meters, with those living at more than 100 meters as the reference category. Discussion Even in this previously highly VL endemic area, PKDL is a rare condition. Nevertheless, even a single case can trigger a new VL outbreak. Leprosy is also a rare disease, but current prevalence is over 17 times the elimination threshold proclaimed by WHO. Both diseases require continued surveillance. Active case finding for leprosy can be recommended among household members and close neighbors of leprosy patients but would not be feasible for entire populations. Periodic skin camps may be a feasible and affordable alternative. © 2019 Hasker et al.

Analyzing the epidemiology of non-random aggregation of patients with a particular disease fostered identification of environmental and external exposures as disease triggers and promoters. Observation of patient clusters and their association with nearby exposures, such as Dr. John Snow's astute mapping analysis in the mid-1800's, which revealed proximity of cholera patients in London to a contaminated water pump infected with Vibrio cholerae, have paved the way for the field of epidemiology. This approach enabled the identification of triggers for many human diseases including infections and cancers. Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) represent a group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas that primarily affect the skin. The detailed pathogenesis by which CTCL develops remains largely unknown. Notably, non-random clustering of CTCL patients was reported in several areas worldwide and this rare malignancy was also described to affect multiple members of the same family. These observations indicate that external factors are possibly implicated in promoting CTCL lymphomagenesis. Here, we review the epidemiology of CTCL worldwide and the clinical characteristics of CTCL patients, as revealed by global epidemiological data. Further, we review the known risk factors including sex, age, race as well as environmental, infectious, iatrogenic and other exposures, that are implicated in CTCL lymphomagenesis and discuss conceivable mechanisms by which these factors may trigger this malignancy.

Objectives: The Skin Care Intervention in Nurses trial tested the hypothesis that a behaviour change package intervention, coupled with provision of hand moisturisers, could reduce the point prevalence of hand dermatitis when compared with standard care among nurses working in the NHS. The secondary aim was to assess the impact of the intervention on participants’ beliefs and behaviour regarding hand care, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in comparison with normal care. Design: Cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting: Thirty-five NHS hospital trusts/health boards/universities. Participants: First-year student nurses with a history of atopic tendency, and full-time intensive care unit nurses. Intervention: Sites were randomly allocated to be ‘intervention plus’ or ‘intervention light’. Participants at ‘intervention plus’ sites received access to a bespoke online behaviour change package intervention, coupled with personal supplies of moisturising cream (student nurses) and optimal availability of moisturising cream (intensive care unit nurses). Nurses at ‘intervention light’ sites received usual care, including a dermatitis prevention leaflet. Main outcome measure: The difference between intervention plus and intervention light sites in the change of point prevalence of visible hand dermatitis was measured from images taken at baseline and at follow-up. Randomisation: Fourteen sites were randomised to the intervention plus arm, and 21 sites were randomised to the intervention light arm. Blinding: The participants, trial statistician, methodologist and the dermatologists interpreting the hand photographs were blinded to intervention assignment. Numbers analysed: An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted on data from 845 student nurses and 1111 intensive care unit nurses. Results: The intention-to-treat analysis showed no evidence that the risk of developing dermatitis was greater in the intervention light group than in the intervention plus group (student nurses: odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 2.69; intensive care unit nurses: odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 2.44). Both groups had high levels of baseline beliefs about the benefits of using hand moisturisers before, during and after work. The frequency of use of hand moisturisers before, during and after shifts was significantly higher in the intensive care unit nurses in the intervention plus arm at follow-up than in the comparator group nurses. For student nurses, the intervention plus group mean costs were £2 lower than those for the comparator and 0.00002 more quality-adjusted life-years were gained. For intensive care unit nurses, costs were £4 higher and 0.0016 fewer quality-adjusted life-years were gained. Harms: No adverse events were reported. Limitations: Only 44.5% of participants in the intervention plus arm accessed the behaviour change package. Conclusion: The intervention did not result in a statistically significant decrease in the prevalence of hand dermatitis in the intervention plus group. © Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2019.

This study aimed to determine the gene expression pattern and pathways related to severe asthma and subsequently identify potential predictor for steroid-resistant asthma. Peripheral blood B lymphocytes were isolated from subjects with severe steroid-resistant (n=7) and severe steroid-dependent (n=7) asthma. Total RNA was extracted from the B lymphocytes and subjected to microarray experiment. Data were analyzed using GeneSpring GX software for differential gene expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to analyze disease pathways. The prediction model was generated using Prophet software and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to validate the microarray gene expression. 307 genes were differentially expressed between both groups with p<0.001 using unpaired t-test. Six genes were selected as steroid-resistant predictor based on a particular selection criteria. Class predictors were identified with a predictive accuracy of 93%. This study has provided a better insight into the expression pattern and pathways of severe asthma and provided potential prognosis biomarkers to discriminate between severe steroid-resistant and steroid-sensitive asthma. © 2018 Pharmascope Publications.

These algorithms use features derived from images as input to make a decision. So, choosing proper feature extraction methods combined with suitable machine learning (ML) algorithms is very important to achieve good classification accuracy. During the literature survey, we found that there is a lack of information about machine learning algorithms for skin disease classification. To address this problem, we have collected Chronic Eczema, Lichen planus and Plaque psoriasis images using a digital camera and extracted Red, Green and Blue (RGB) color features and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture features. Different combinations of features with four popular ML algorithms were considered to compare classifier performances.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between incidences of infantile eczema in children under 2 years of age and urban outdoor environmental factors. Methods: A 11-year population-based study was conducted in retrospective design. The age/gender-adjusted incidence rates of infantile eczema were determined using the data of outpatient visits. We analysed 1965 cases with atopic dermatitis including infantile eczema in relation to the annual means of outdoor monitoring data from 2005 through 2015 in Minsk. Logistic regression and principal component analysis were performed to determine association between the annual means of air pollutants, meteorological variables and incidences of infantile eczema. Results: Higher mean annual carbon monoxide, ammonia, formaldehyde, lead, particulate matter and ground-level ozone were associated with high incidence rates of infantile eczema both in boys and girls. Higher nitrogen dioxide was associated with high incidence rates of infantile eczema in girls 1–2 years of age and boys 0–2 years of age. There were identified by principal component analysis five combinations of pollutants and meteorological factors. High incidence rates of infantile eczema were associated with the combinations contained higher levels of air pollutants and ultraviolet index, or lower β-activity of the radionuclide-associated aerosols. The higher phenol and formaldehyde levels the higher incidence rates of infantile eczema were observed among boys 0–1 years of age and girls 1–2 years of age. The higher total column ozone with lower lead level was associated with low incidence rates of infantile eczema among boys and girls 1–2 years of age. Conclusion: Urban outdoor air pollutants and their combination with meteorological conditions may impact onset of infantile eczema in both genders. © 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",,"ammonia; carbon monoxide; formaldehyde; lead; nitrogen dioxide; radioisotope; ozone; radioisotope; aerosol; age distribution; air pollution; Article; atopic dermatitis; child; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; female; human; humidity; incidence; infant; major clinical study; male; meteorological phenomena; onset age; ozone layer; particulate matter; population research; preschool child; priority journal; sex difference; ultraviolet radiation; urban area; aerosol; air pollutant; atopic dermatitis; Belarus; chemistry; cohort analysis; confidence interval; environmental exposure; newborn; odds ratio; pathophysiology; retrospective study; risk assessment; statistical model; urban population; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Confidence Intervals; Dermatitis, Atopic; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Male; Odds Ratio; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Radioisotopes; Republic of Belarus; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Urban Population",,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; formaldehyde, 50-00-0; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; ozone, 10028-15-6; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Radioisotopes",,,,,,,,"Wadonda-Kabondo, N., Sterne, J.A., Golding, J., A prospective study of the prevalence and incidence of atopic dermatitis in children aged 0–42 months (2003) Br J Dermatol, 149, pp. 1023-1028; Ben-Gashir, M.A., Seed, P.T., Hay, R.J., Predictors of atopic dermatitis severity over time (2004) J Am Acad Dermatol, 50, pp. 349-356; Ahn, K., The role of air pollutants in atopic dermatitis (2014) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 134, pp. 993-999; Flohr, C., Mann, J., New insights into the epidemiology of childhood atopic dermatitis (2014) Allergy, 69, pp. 3-16; Huss-Marp, J., Eberlein-König, B., Breuer, K., Influence of short-term exposure to airborne Der p 1 and volatile organic compounds on skin barrier function and dermal blood flow in patients with atopic eczema and healthy individuals (2006) Clin Exp Allergy, 36, pp. 338-345; Morgenstern, V., Zutavern, A., Cyrys, J., Atopic diseases, allergic sensitization, and exposure to traffic-related air pollution in children (2008) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 177, pp. 1331-1337; Eller, E., Kjaer, H.F., Høst, A., Andersen, K.E., Bindslev-Jensen, C., Development of atopic dermatitis in the DARC birth cohort (2010) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 21 (2), pp. 307-314; Ballardini, N., Bergström, A., Böhme, M., Infantile eczema: prognosis and risk of asthma and rhinitis in preadolescence (2014) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 133, pp. 594-596; Kramer, U., Sugiri, D., Ranft, U., Eczema, respiratory allergies, and traffic-related air pollution in birth cohorts from small-town areas (2009) J Dermatol Sci, 56, pp. 99-105; Kathuria, P., Silverberg, J.I., Association of pollution and climate with atopic eczema in US children (2016) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 27, pp. 478-485; Sultz, H.A., Feldman, J.G., Schlesinger, E.R., Mosher, W.E., An effect of continued exposure to air pollution on the incidence of chronic childhood allergic disease (1970) Am J Public Health Nations Health, 60, pp. 891-900; Jedrychowski, W., Perera, F., Maugeri, U., Effects of prenatal and perinatal exposure to fine air pollutants and maternal fish consumption on the occurrence of infantile eczema (2011) Int Arch Allergy Immunol, 155, pp. 275-281; (2008) Ministry of Health of the Republic of Belarus, , http://minzdrav.gov.by/en/dlya-spetsialistov/standarty-obsledovaniya-i-lecheniya/2008-god.php, The clinical protocol for diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis of atopic dermatitis., (last accessed 8 April 2018); Hanifin, J.M., Rajka, G., Diagnostic features of atopic dermatitis (1980) Acta Derm Venereol, 92, pp. 44-47; Population by sex and age of the Republic of Belarus, , http://minsk-city.belstat.gov.by/ofitsialnaya-statistika/publications/public_compilation/index_6458, Statistical Bulletin, Minsk-City.

The relation between AD severity and disease comorbidities is complex and not fully understood. Objective: To determine the complex relation between AD severity and comorbidities. Methods: A cross-sectional US population-based study of 8,217 adults who were participants in a nationally representative internet health panel was performed using a structured questionnaire. A diagnosis of AD was determined using modified United Kingdom Working Party Criteria for AD (n = 602). AD severity was assessed using Patient-Oriented Scoring AD, Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, Dermatology Life Quality Index, and self-reported global AD severity. Logistic regression and structural equation models were used to explore associations of AD with self-reported allergic, cardiometabolic, anxiety and depression, and autoimmune disease. Results: In multivariable regression models controlling for sociodemographics, AD was associated with higher odds of asthma (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71–2.55), hay fever (OR 4.31, 95% CI 3.27–5.69), food allergy (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.54–2.77), anxiety and depression (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.91–2.87), autoimmune disease (OR 3.05, 95% CI 2.31–4.03), obesity (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.13–1.67), diabetes (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.16–1.99), high blood pressure (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.18–1.80), and heart disease (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.40–2.70) compared with controls (P <.01 for all). All these associations were significant in mild and/or moderate disease, with even stronger effects in severe AD. Results of structural equation models showed direct effects of moderate to severe AD on food allergy, anxiety and depression, and diabetes, direct and indirect effects on obesity, and indirect effects on high blood pressure and heart disease. Conclusion: There is a strong relation of AD severity to allergic, autoimmune, and cardiovascular comorbidities. © 2018 The Authors",,"adult; allergy; American; anxiety disorder; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; autoimmune disease; cardiovascular disease; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; depression; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease severity; eczema; female; food allergy; heart disease; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; obesity; pollen allergy; priority journal; quality of life; scoring system; self report",,,,,,"We thank Eugene Semenov for his assistance with structural equation models.",,,,"Silverberg, J.I., Gelfand, J.M., Margolis, D.J., Patient-burden and quality of life in atopic dermatitis in US adults: a population-based cross-sectional study [published online ahead of print July 6, 2018].

No US recommendations exist regarding optimally implementing EEI. Methods: Using simulation and Markov modelling over a 20-year horizon, we explored optimal EEI strategies applied to US, European and Canadian populations, comparing screening of high-risk infants (skin prick testing [SPT] or serum-specific IgE[sIgE]) before introducing cooked egg at 6 months of life vs egg introduction at home, without screening, for all infants. Results: A no-screen approach dominated egg SPT screening of high-risk infants with early-onset eczema. Base model per-patient incremental costs of SPT were $6865 US dollars (USD), 6801 euros and $10 610 Canadian dollars (CAD). For egg sIgE screening in primary care settings, base model incremental costs were $16 722 USD, 18 072 euros and $28 193 CAD. As the simulation concluded 2.5% were egg allergic without screening vs 9.5%, 12% and 21.4% of children undergoing SPT, delayed introduction or sIgE screening. Incremental societal costs from screening reached $2 009 351 175 USD for SPT and $4 894 445 790 USD for sIgE testing. In sensitivity analyses, if the risk of reaction with initial egg ingestion was ≥22.5%, SPT before EEI became a preferred strategy. A no-screen approach dominated both EEI of raw pasteurized egg and delayed cooked egg introduction approaches.

We propose that the discrepancies arise in part because allergic sensitisation may not be a single entity (as considered conventionally) but a collection of several different classes of sensitisation. We hypothesise that pairings between immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to individual allergenic molecules (components), rather than IgE responses to ‘informative’ molecules, are associated with increased risk of asthma. Methods and findings: In a cross-sectional analysis among 461 children aged 11 years participating in a population-based birth cohort, we measured serum-specific IgE responses to 112 allergen components using a multiplex array (ImmunoCAP Immuno‑Solid phase Allergy Chip [ISAC]). We characterised sensitivity to 44 active components (specific immunoglobulin E [sIgE] > 0.30 units in at least 5% of children) among the 213 (46.2%) participants sensitised to at least one of these 44 components. We adopted several machine learning methodologies that offer a powerful framework to investigate the highly complex sIgE–asthma relationship. Firstly, we applied network analysis and hierarchical clustering (HC) to explore the connectivity structure of component-specific IgEs and identify clusters of component-specific sensitisation (‘component clusters’). Of the 44 components included in the model, 33 grouped in seven clusters (C.sIgE-1–7), and the remaining 11 formed singleton clusters. Cluster membership mapped closely to the structural homology of proteins and/or their biological source. Components in the pathogenesis-related (PR)-10 proteins cluster (C.sIgE-5) were central to the network and mediated connections between components from grass (C.sIgE-4), trees (C.sIgE-6), and profilin clusters (C.sIgE-7) with those in mite (C.sIgE-1), lipocalins (C.sIgE-3), and peanut clusters (C.sIgE-2). We then used HC to identify four common ‘sensitisation clusters’ among study participants: (1) multiple sensitisation (sIgE to multiple components across all seven component clusters and singleton components), (2) predominantly dust mite sensitisation (IgE responses mainly to components from C.sIgE-1), (3) predominantly grass and tree sensitisation (sIgE to multiple components across C.sIgE-4–7), and (4) lower-grade sensitisation. We used a bipartite network to explore the relationship between component clusters, sensitisation clusters, and asthma, and the joint density-based nonparametric differential interaction network analysis and classification (JDINAC) to test whether pairwise interactions of component-specific IgEs are associated with asthma. JDINAC with pairwise interactions provided a good balance between sensitivity (0.84) and specificity (0.87), and outperformed penalised logistic regression with individual sIgE components in predicting asthma, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94, compared with 0.73. We then inferred the differential network of pairwise component-specific IgE interactions, which demonstrated that 18 pairs of components predicted asthma. These findings were confirmed in an independent sample of children aged 8 years who participated in the same birth cohort but did not have component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) data at age 11 years. The main limitation of our study was the exclusion of potentially important allergens caused by both the ISAC chip resolution as well as the filtering step. Clustering and the network analyses might have provided different solutions if additional components had been available. Conclusions: Interactions between pairs of sIgE components are associated with increased risk of asthma and may provide the basis for designing diagnostic tools for asthma. © 2018 Fontanella et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",,"allergen; house dust allergen; immunoglobulin 7S; immunoglobulin E antibody; lipocalin; napin; profilin; allergen; biological marker; immunoglobulin E; algorithm; allergic reaction; antibody response; antigen antibody reaction; area under the curve; Article; asthma; child; clinical outcome; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; comparative study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; demography; Dermatophagoides; differential diagnosis; disease classification; eczema; follow up; grass; human; machine learning; major clinical study; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; mite; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; pairwise interaction; pathogenesis; peanut allergy; protein expression; protein interaction; protein microarray; questionnaire; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; school child; sensitivity and specificity; sensitization; tree; validation process; wheezing; asthma; blood; data mining; England; female; hypersensitivity; immunology; male; procedures; risk assessment; Allergens; Asthma; Biomarkers; Child; Cluster Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Mining; England; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunoglobulin E; Machine Learning; Male; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors",,"napin, 89147-51-3; profilin, 131383-86-3; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Allergens; Biomarkers; Immunoglobulin E","ImmunoCAP ISAC, Thermo, Sweden","Thermo, Sweden","Medical Research Council, MRC: MR/K002449/1, MR/L012693/1","The authors AC and AS received from the Medical Research Council (https://mrc.ukri.org/) with grants MR/L012693/1 and MR/K002449/1.",,,,"Custovic, A., Lazic, N., Simpson, A., Pediatric asthma and development of atopy (2013) Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology, 13 (2), pp. 173-180. , pmid:23385287; Oksel, C., Custovic, A., Development of allergic sensitization and its relevance to paediatric asthma (2018) Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 18 (2), pp. 109-116. , pmid:29389732; Pearce, N., Pekkanen, J., Beasley, R., How much asthma is really attributable to atopy?

The clinical characteristics and progression of 25 early onset HAM/TSP associated or not to IDH were described. Methods Following-up 37 IDH patients with neurological examinations, 54% developed HAM/TSP. To these cases were added 5 cases of juvenile HAM/TSP. The patients were HTLV-1+ and were submitted to dermatological and neurological examinations. Diagnosis of HAM/TSP was performed according to Osame et al (1990) and Castro-Costa et al (2006) criteria. Results Twenty-one patients were classified as definite HAM/TSP by both criteria, 3 as probable HAM/TSP by Osame et al, and another as probable HAM/TSP according to Castro-Costa et al Median age at onset of neurological manifestations was 9 years for the IDH/HAM/TSP group and 16 years for the HAM/TSP group (P =.045). In 12 patients, the onset of neurological manifestations occurred when they were less than 10 years of age. In the group IDH/HAM/TSP, the neurological symptoms always begun during the period of activity of IDH. The progression of HAM/TSP evaluated in 17 cases was heterogeneous, and 3 had rapid progressive course. Conclusions The juvenile HAM/TSP may occur very early and also presents marked female predominance. Progression of IDH to HAM/TSP before 19 years of age is frequent (54%). Rapid progressive form may also occur in early HAM/TSP. As juvenile IDH and HAM/TSP are due to vertical transmission through breastfeeding, it is very important to avoid this pathway of infection. © The Author(s) 2018.

We aim to investigate associations between prenatal PCB exposure and these health outcomes in the offspring of women who worked at the LaSalle Electrical Utilities Company (EUC). Methods: A retrospective cohort with at least one live birth and known employment time at EUC was eligible for this analysis. Exposure was defined and categorized by the number of fiscal quarters worked during the PCB era (1952–1981). A total of 288 women with 800 live births were included. A Chi-Square test was used to compare maternal and child characteristics across exposure groups and repeated measures logistic regression, controlling for clustering among siblings, was used to assess the associations between prenatal PCB exposure and these outcomes. Results: After adjustment for confounding and independent maternal predictors, 1–4 quarters of prenatal exposure to PCBs increased the odds for asthma (OR 3.24[1.30–8.09]), eczema/hay fever (OR 3.29[1.54–7.04]), and frequent ear infections (OR 2.24[1.19–4.22]) when compared with persons unexposed/exposed only to naphthalenes. The significance of the associations varied by exposure period and level of exposure, with the strongest associations in those employed exclusively after 1952 when PCBs were introduced. Conclusions: These results support previous findings of associations of prenatal exposure to PCBs with asthma, eczema/hay fever, and frequent ear infections. Additional prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings. Also required are more precise PCB exposures to separate them from other exposures in occupational settings. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Epidemiology; morbidity; mortality","naphthalene derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; naphthalene derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; adult; Article; asthma; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; ear infection; eczema; employment; female; human; infant; live birth; major clinical study; occupational exposure; outcome assessment; pollen allergy; prenatal exposure; progeny; retrospective study; adolescent; asthma; comorbidity; dose response; eczema; health behavior; male; maternal age; otitis; pollen allergy; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Asthma; Comorbidity; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Eczema; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Maternal Age; Naphthalenes; Occupational Exposure; Otitis; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Retrospective Studies; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Young Adult",,"Naphthalenes; Polychlorinated Biphenyls",,,"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS

The yellow spots were procured from the surface of a number of leaves and other objects from three different localities of Lucknow District of Uttar Pradesh. The size and shapes of these spots vary, ranging from linear to circular. Pollen grains recovered in good frequencies chiefly belong to angiosperms, whereas some gymnosperm pollen was also observed in trace frequencies. Other microbiota include fern spores, fungal remains and insect body parts in lower values. The study broadly suggests that palynomorphs recovered from yellow droppings are not fully airborne; rather, they are the types that honey bees gather from crop fields to feed their young. Brassica campestris and Asteroideae are the dominant plant taxa recorded in yellow rain samples. On investigation, it was noticed that yellow drop falling occurred for a few minutes on limited days during the summer of 2014, when the atmosphere experienced optimal temperature conditions with relatively humid environs. The observation also confirms that the yellow spots are nothing but faecal droppings, as suggested by the bee faeces theory which proposed that the origin of yellow rain is a phenomenon of nature. The study, in addition to aiding in understanding yellow rain occurrence, could also be helpful in aerobiological research, especially in examining the allergenicity of various pollen grains/spores in the area of investigation, causing bronchial asthma, hay fever (allergic rhinitis/pollinosis), nasobronchial allergy and other respiratory disorders along with conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, food allergies and other health ailments. A multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to quantified data obtained from pollen frequency analyses of different areas of Lucknow, which clearly revealed a significant group variation in vegetation type on the basis of dispersal and deposition of pollen in yellow spots. © 2018, © 2018 AASP – The Palynological Society.","allergenicity; honey bee; India; Lucknow; palynology; Uttar Pradesh; yellow spot","air temperature; allergy; angiosperm; canola; concentration (composition); fern; frequency analysis; fungus; gymnosperm; honeybee; humid environment; particle size; pollen; rainfall; respiratory disease; spore; India; Lucknow; Uttar Pradesh; Uttar Pradesh; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Asteroideae; Brassica rapa; Filicophyta; Gymnospermae; Hexapoda; Magnoliophyta",,,,,"Universität Hohenheim

Similarly, not all atopic individuals develop wheeze, and vice versa. The reasons for these differences are unclear. Using unsupervised model-based cluster analysis, we identified latent clusters within a prospective birth cohort with deep immunological and respiratory phenotyping. We characterised each cluster in terms of immunological profile and disease risk, and replicated our results in external cohorts from the UK and USA. We discovered three distinct trajectories, one of which is a high-risk ‘atopic’ cluster with increased propensity for allergic diseases throughout childhood. Atopy contributes varyingly to later wheeze depending on cluster membership. Our findings demonstrate the utility of unsupervised analysis in elucidating heterogeneity in asthma pathogenesis and provide a foundation for improving management and prevention of childhood asthma. © Tang et al.",,"immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G4; interleukin 13; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; algorithm; allergic disease; allergy; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; body mass; child; child health; childhood disease; cluster analysis; controlled study; eczema; female; food allergy; genetic heterogeneity; Haemophilus; human; hypersensitivity; immune response; immunity; infant; lower respiratory tract infection; male; Moraxella; nasopharyngeal aspiration; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; phenotype; prick test; principal component analysis; protein expression; questionnaire; respiratory tract infection; rhinopharyngitis; risk factor; Streptococcus; upper respiratory tract infection; wheezing; asthma; Australia; growth, development and aging; hypersensitivity; immune system; immunology; pathophysiology; preschool child; respiratory system; Asthma; Australia; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immune System; Infant; Male; Respiratory System; Risk Factors",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0",,,"Medical Research Council, MRC: G0601361, MR/K002449/1, MR/L003120/1, MR/M015181/1",,,,,"Aalberse, R., The role of IgG antibodies in allergy and immunotherapy (2011) Allergy, 66, pp. 28-30; Almqvist, C., Worm, M., Leynaert, B., Impact of gender on asthma in childhood and adolescence: A GA2LEN review (2008) Allergy, 63, pp. 47-57. , working group of GA2LEN WP 2.5 Gender; Anderson, G.P., Endotyping asthma: New insights into key pathogenic mechanisms in a complex, heterogeneous disease (2008) The Lancet, 372, pp. 1107-1119; Ballardini, N., Nilsson, C., Nilsson, M., Lilja, G., ImmunoCAP Phadiatop Infant–a new blood test for detecting IgE sensitisation in children at 2 years of age (2006) Allergy, 61, pp. 337-343. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2005.00936.x, 16436143; Bantz, S.K., Zhu, Z., Zheng, T., The atopic march: Progression from atopic dermatitis to allergic rhinitis and asthma (2014) Journal of Clinical & Cellular Immunology, 5, pp. 67-73. , https://doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000202; Belgrave, D.C.M., Simpson, A., Semic-Jusufagic, A., Murray, C.S., Buchan, I., Pickles, A., Custovic, A., Joint modeling of parentally reported and physician-confirmed wheeze identifies children with persistent troublesome wheezing (2013) Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 132, pp. 575-583. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2013.05.041, 23906378; Belgrave, D.C., Granell, R., Simpson, A., Guiver, J., Bishop, C., Buchan, I., Henderson, A.J., Custovic, A., Developmental profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis: Two population-based birth cohort studies (2014) Plos Medicine, 11. , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001748, 25335105; Benaglia, T., Chauveau, D., Hunter, D.R., Young, D.S., Mixtools: An R package for analyzing mixture models (2009) Journal of Statistical Software, 32; Benaglia, T., Chauveau, D., Hunter, D.R., An EM-Like Algorithm for Semi-and Nonparametric Estimation in Multivariate Mixtures (2009) Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 18, pp. 505-526. , https://doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07175; Benjamini, Y., Yekutieli, D., The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency (2001) The Annals of Statistics, 29, pp. 1165-1188; Bisgaard, H., Hermansen, M.N., Buchvald, F., Loland, L., Halkjaer, L.B., Bønnelykke, K., Brasholt, M., Pipper, C.B., Childhood asthma after bacterial colonization of the airway in neonates (2007) New England Journal of Medicine, 357, pp. 1487-1495. , https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa052632, 17928596; Bousquet, J., Anto, J.M., Wickman, M., Keil, T., Valenta, R., Haahtela, T., Lodrup Carlsen, K., Gehrig, U., Are allergic multimorbidities and IgE polysensitization associated with the persistence or re-occurrence of foetal type 2 signalling?

Design: Pragmatic, randomised, open-label, multicentre superiority trial with two parallel groups. Setting: Ninety-six general practices in Wales, the west of England and southern England. Invitation by personal letter or opportunistically. Participants: Children aged between 12 months and 12 years fulfilling the UK Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Eczema. Children with inactive or very mild eczema (a score of ≤ 5 on the Nottingham Eczema Severity Scale) were excluded, as were children who bathed less than once per week or whose parents/ carers were not prepared to accept randomisation. Interventions: The intervention group were prescribed bath additives by their usual clinical team and were asked to use them regularly for 12 months. The control group were asked to use no bath additives for 12 months. Both groups continued standard eczema management, including regular leave-on emollients and topical corticosteroids (TCSs) when required. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was eczema control measured by Patient Oriented Eczema Measure [POEM, 0 (clear) to 28 (severe)] weekly for 16 weeks. The secondary outcomes were eczema severity over 1 year (4-weekly POEM), number of eczema exacerbations, disease-specific quality of life (QoL) (Dermatitis Family Impact Questionnaire), generic QoL (Child Health Utility-9 Dimensions) and type and quantity of topical steroid/calcineurin inhibitors prescribed. Children were randomised (1: 1) using online software to either bath additives plus standard eczema care or standard eczema care alone, stratified by recruiting centre, and there was open-label blinding. Results: From December 2014 to May 2016, 482 children were randomised: 51% were female, 84% were white and the mean age was 5 years (n = 264 in the intervention group, n = 218 in the control group). Reported adherence to randomised treatment allocation was > 92% in both groups, with 76.7% of participants completing at least 12 (80%) of the first 16 weekly questionnaires for the primary outcome. Baseline POEM score was 9.5 [standard deviation (SD) 5.7] in the bath additives group and 10.1 (SD 5.8) in the no bath additives group. Average POEM score over the first 16 weeks was 7.5 (SD 6.0) in the bath additives group and 8.4 (SD 6.0) in the no bath additives group, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. After controlling for baseline severity and confounders (ethnicity, TCS use, soap substitute use) and allowing for clustering of participants within centres and responses within participants over time, POEM scores in the no bath additive group were 0.41 points higher than in the bath additive group (95% confidence interval –0.27 to 1.10), which is well below the published minimal clinically important difference of 3 points. There was no difference between groups in secondary outcomes or in adverse effects such as redness, stinging or slipping. Limitations: Simple randomisation resulted in an imbalance in baseline group size, although baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. Conclusion: This trial found no evidence of clinical benefit of including emollient bath additives in the standard management of childhood eczema. Future work: Further research is required on optimal regimens of leave-on emollients and the use of emollients as soap substitutes. © Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.",,"calcium channel blocking agent; corticosteroid derivative; emollient agent; calcineurin inhibitor; corticosteroid; emollient agent; age distribution; Article; atopic dermatitis; Caucasian; Child Health Utility 9 Dimensions; childhood disease; clinical effectiveness; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; Dermatitis Family Impact Questionnaire; disease severity assessment; economic evaluation; eczema; England; ethnicity; health economics; human; injection site stinging; multicenter study (topic); Nottingham Eczema Severity Scale; open study; parallel design; patient compliance; Patient Oriented Eczema Measure score; pragmatic trial; prescription; quality of life assessment; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial (topic); scoring system; sex ratio; skin redness; treatment outcome; United Kingdom; Wales; bath; child; clinical trial; controlled study; economics; eczema; female; health care cost; health care planning; infant; male; medication compliance; multicenter study; preschool child; procedures; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; severity of illness index; statistics and numerical data; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Baths; Calcineurin Inhibitors; Child; Child, Preschool; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Eczema; Emollients; Female; Health Expenditures; Health Resources; Humans; Infant; Male; Medication Adherence; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; United Kingdom",,"Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Calcineurin Inhibitors; Emollients",,,"National Institute for Health Research, NIHR

Subtypes of stuttering were then identified based on latent class analysis (LCA). Methods Data were from two representative Swiss population samples: PsyCoLaus (N = 4,874, age 35–82 years) and the ZInEP Epidemiology Survey (N = 1,500, age 20–41 years). Associations between stuttering and sociodemographic characteristics, familial aggregation, comorbidity and psychosocial risk / associated factors were investigated in both samples. LCAs were conducted on selected items from people in both samples who reported having stuttered in childhood. Results Initial analyses linked early anxiety disorders, such as separation anxiety disorder and overanxious disorder, to stuttering (PsyCoLaus). ADHD was associated with stuttering in both datasets. In the analyses of risk / associated factors, dysfunctional parental relationships, inter-parental violence and further childhood adversities were mutual predictors of stuttering. Moreover, comorbidities were seen with hay fever, asthma, eczema and psoriasis (PsyCoLaus). Subsequent LCA identified an unspecific group of persons who self-reported that they stuttered and a group defined by associations with psychosocial adversities (ZINEP, PsyCoLaus) and atopic diseases (PsyCoLaus). Conclusions The two subtypes of developmental stuttering have different risk / associated factors and comorbidity patterns. Most of the factors are associated with vulnerability mechanisms that occur early in life and that have also been linked with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Both psychosocial and biological factors appear to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of stuttering. © 2018 Ajdacic-Gross et al.

The donor had no further role in the experimental design, the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, the writing of this report or the decision to submit this paper for publication. The donor was a private individual, who remained unknown to the research group by introducing the authorities of the Canton of Zurich as trustees for his donation. Neither the donor nor the authorities of the Canton took influence on any of the ZInEP subprojects. This applies also to the ZInEP epidemiology survey. Accordingly, neither the donor nor the authorities of the Canton of Zurich had a role in the experimental design, the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, the writing of this report or the decision to submit this paper for publication. No research costs or authors’ salaries were funded, in whole or in part, by a tobacco company, since the authorities of the Canton of Zurich would not accept the role as trustee for a health project, if the donation were associated with a tobacco company.

However, EPI recommendations differ among countries with formal guidelines. Methods: Using simulation and Markov modeling over a 20-year horizon to attempt to explore optimal EPI strategies applied to the US population, we compared high-risk infant-specific IgE peanut screening (US/Canadian) with the Australiasian Society for Clinical Immunology and Allergy (Australia/New Zealand) (ASCIA) and the United Kingdom Department of Health (UKDOH)-published EPI approaches. Results: Screening peanut skin testing of all children with early-onset eczema and/or egg allergy before in-office peanut introduction was dominated by a no screening approach, in terms of number of cases of peanut allergy prevented, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and healthcare costs, although screening resulted in a slightly lower rate of allergic reactions to peanut per patient in high-risk children. Considering costs of peanut allergy in high-risk children, the per-patient cost of early introduction without screening over the model horizon was $6556.69 (95%CI, $6512.76-$6600.62), compared with a cost of $7576.32 (95%CI, $7531.38-$7621.26) for skin test screening prior to introduction. From a US societal perspective, screening prior to introduction cost $654 115 322 and resulted in 3208 additional peanut allergy diagnoses. Both screening and nonscreening approaches dominated deliberately delayed peanut introduction. Conclusions: A no-screening approach for EPI has superior health and economic benefits in terms of number of peanut allergy cases prevented, QALY, and total healthcare costs compared to screening and in-office peanut introduction. © 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of this intervention in Singapore. METHODS Modelling techniques were used to simulate, from birth to Month 30, the incidence and clinical/economic burden of AD in high-risk, non-exclusively breastfed infants fed with PHF-W or CMF for up to four months. Epidemiologic and clinical data were from a local comparative trial. Expert opinion informed AD treatment patterns and outcomes. Outcomes included reduction in AD risk, time spent with AD, days without AD flare, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct/indirect costs. Multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess model parameter uncertainty. RESULTS Over 30 months, with the use of PHF-W instead of CMF, the proportion of children who developed AD and the time spent with AD decreased by 16.0% (28.3% vs. 44.3%) and 6.4 months, respectively, while time without AD flare and QALYs increased by 14.9 days and 0.021 QALYs per patient, respectively. Estimated AD-related discounted costs per child for PHF-W and CMF were SGD 771 and SGD 1,309, respectively (net savings: SGD 538). PHF-W was less expensive and more effective than CMF for 73%, and cost less than SGD 50,000 per QALY for 87% of all multivariate simulations. CONCLUSION Early short-term nutritional intervention with PHF-W instead of CMF may reduce AD incidence and costs for healthy, high-risk, non-exclusively breastfed infants in Singapore. © 2018, Singapore Medical Association.

Objective: To determine the associations and clinical characteristics of adult-onset AD. Methods: A prospective study of 356 adults with AD (age ≥18 years) was performed using standardized questionnaires and examination. AD severity was assessed using the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, Eczema Area and Severity Index, Scoring Atopic Dermatitis, body surface area, and numeric rating scale for itch and sleeplessness. Latent class analysis was used to determine dominant clinical phenotypes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between adult-onset AD and distinct phenotypes. Results: One hundred forty-nine adults (41.9%) reported onset of AD during adulthood, with 87 (24.4%) after the age of 50 years. Adult- versus childhood-onset AD was associated with birthplace outside the United States (χ2, P =.0008), but not sex, race/ethnicity, current smoking status, or alcohol consumption (P ≥.11); and decreased personal history of asthma, hay fever, and food allergy and family history of asthma and food allergy (P ≤.0001 for all). There was no significant difference in the Eczema Area and Severity Index, Scoring Atopic Dermatitis, body surface area, numeric rating scale for itch and sleeplessness, or Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure between adult- and childhood-onset AD (Mann-Whitney U test, P ≥.10). Latent class analysis identified 3 classes: (1) high probability of flexural dermatitis and xerosis with intermediate to high probabilities of head, neck, and hand dermatitis; (2) high probability of flexural dermatitis and xerosis, but low probabilities of head, neck, and hand dermatitis; and (3) lower probability of flexural dermatitis, but the highest probabilities of virtually all other signs and symptoms. Adult-onset AD was significantly associated with class 1 (multivariate logistic regression; adjusted odds ratio, 5.54; 95% CI, 1.59-19.28) and class 3 (adjusted odds ratio, 14.03; 95% CI, 2.33-85.50). Conclusions: Self-reported adult-onset AD is common and has distinct phenotypes with lesional predilection for the hands and/or head/neck. © 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Adult onset; Asthma; Atopic dermatitis; Atopic history; Eczema; Hay fever; Severity","adult; adult disease; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; birthplace; body surface; childhood disease; clinical examination; clinical feature; controlled study; disease severity assessment; Eczema Area and Severity Index; ethnicity; family history; female; food allergy; human; insomnia; latent class analysis; major clinical study; male; medical history; numeric rating scale; onset age; Patient Oriented Eczema Measure; phenotype; pollen allergy; probability; prospective study; pruritus; questionnaire; race difference; Scoring Atopic Dermatitis; self report; sex difference; smoking; United States; very elderly; xerosis; adolescent; atopic dermatitis; child; comparative study; middle aged; phenotype; preschool child; severity of illness index; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Prospective Studies; Self Report; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,,,"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS: UL1TR001422",,,,,"Williams, H.C., Epidemiology of human atopic dermatitis—seven areas of notable progress and seven areas of notable ignorance (2013) Vet Dermatol, 24, pp. 3-9.e1-2; Silverberg, J.I., Garg, N., Paller, A.S., Fishbein, A., Zee, P.C., Sleep disturbances in adults with eczema are associated with impaired overall health: a US population-based study (2015) J Invest Dermatol, 135, pp. 56-66; Silverberg, J.I., Hanifin, J.M., Adult eczema prevalence and associations with asthma and other health and demographic factors: a US population-based study (2013) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 132, pp. 1132-1138; Margolis, J.S., Abuabara, K., Bilker, W., Hoffstad, O., Margolis, D.J., Persistence of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (2014) JAMA Dermatol, 150, pp. 593-600; Kim, J.P., Chao, L.X., Simpson, E.L., Silverberg, J.I., Persistence of atopic dermatitis (AD): a systematic review and meta-analysis (2016) J Am Acad Dermatol, 75, pp. 681-687.e11; Hanifin, J.M., Reed, M.L., Eczema, P., A population-based survey of eczema prevalence in the United States (2007) Dermatitis, 18, pp. 82-91; Ozkaya, E., Adult-onset atopic dermatitis (2005) J Am Acad Dermatol, 52, pp. 579-582; Nnoruka, E.N., Current epidemiology of atopic dermatitis in south-eastern Nigeria (2004) Int J Dermatol, 43, pp. 739-744; Sandstrom Falk, M.H., Faergemann, J., Atopic dermatitis in adults: does it disappear with age?

Method: Patients >50 years old, meeting the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for hand OA, with pain >50 on 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), morning stiffness >30 min and ≥1 erosive joint on X-ray with synovitis present on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Patients were randomised to adalimumab (40 mg subcutaneous injections every other week) or identical placebo injections for 12 weeks followed by an 8-week washout and then crossed over treatment groups for another 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in VAS hand pain over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included change in Australian/Canadian Hand OA Index (AUSCAN) pain, function and stiffness subscales from baseline to 4, 8 and 12 weeks, change in MRI-detected synovitis and bone marrow lesions (BMLs) from baseline to 12 weeks and change in VAS from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks. Results: We recruited 51 patients and 43 were randomised to either Group 1 (N = 18, active then placebo) or Group 2 (N = 25, placebo then active). At 12 weeks there was no difference between the groups on the primary outcome measure (mean decrease in VAS pain of 3.2 mm standard deviation (SD 16.7) for adalimumab vs 0.8 mm (SD 29.6) for placebo). The adjusted treatment effect was −0.7 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) −9.3 to 8.0), P = 0.87. No statistically significant differences were found for any secondary outcomes. Conclusion: Adalimumab did not show any effect on pain, synovitis or BMLs in patients with erosive hand OA with MRI-detected synovitis as compared to placebo after 12 weeks.

However, a consistent association between 25(OH)D and asthma during adulthood has yet to be found in observational studies. We aimed to test the association between 25(OH)D and asthma during adulthood and hypothesised that this association would be stronger in non-atopic participants. Using information collected on the participants of the 1958 birth cohort, we developed a novel measure of atopic status using total and specific IgE values and reported history of eczema and allergic rhinitis. We designed a nested case-control analysis, stratified by atopic status, and using logistic regression models investigated the association between 25(OH)D measured at age 46 years with the prevalence of asthma and wheezy bronchitis at age 50 years, excluding participants who reported ever having asthma or wheezy bronchitis before the age of 42. In the fully adjusted models, a 10 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D prevalence had a significant association with asthma (aOR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88–1.00). There was some evidence of an atopic dependent trend in the association between 25(OH)D levels and asthma. Further analytical work on the operationalisation of atopy status would prove useful to uncover whether there is a role for 25(OH)D and other risk factors for asthma. © 2018 by the authors.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of the temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) treatment in children/adolescents with severe AE. Methods: We recruited 15 children aged 2-16 years with long-standing, severe AE and sensitization to ≥1 perennial inhalant allergen. Run-in period of 6-10 weeks (3 visits) was followed by 12-month treatment with overnight TLA (Airsonett®, Sweden). The primary outcome was eczema severity (SCORAD-Index and Investigator Global Assessment-IGA). Secondary outcomes included child/family dermatology quality of life and family impact questionnaires (CDQLI, FDQLI, DFI), patient-oriented eczema measure (POEM), medication requirements and healthcare contacts. The study is registered as ISRCTN65865773. Results: There was a significant reduction in AE severity ascertained by SCORAD and IGA during the 12-month intervention period (P &lt;.001). SCORAD was reduced from a median of 34.9 [interquartile range 28.75-45.15] at Baseline to 17.2 [12.95-32.3] at the final visit, and IGA improved significantly from 4 [3-4] to 2 [1-3]. We observed a significant improvement in FDQLI (16.0 [12.25-19.0] to 12 [8-18], P =.023) and DFI (P =.011), but not CDQLI or POEM. Compared to 6-month period prior to enrolment, there was a significant reduction at six months after the start of the intervention in potent topical corticosteroids (P =.033). The exploratory cluster analysis revealed two strongly divergent patterns of response, with 9 patients classified as responders, and 6 as non-responders. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance: Addition of TLA device to standard pharmacological treatment may be an effective add-on to the management of difficult-to-control AE. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aeroallergen exposure; allergen avoidance; atopic eczema; environmental control; particle reduction; temperature-controlled laminar airflow","antibiotic agent; calcineurin inhibitor; corticosteroid; emollient agent; adolescent; airborne particle; antibiotic therapy; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child; clinical article; disease duration; disease severity; female; food allergy; health care utilization; human; laminar airflow; male; open study; outcome assessment; particle size; patient compliance; preschool child; priority journal; rhinoconjunctivitis; school child; sensitization; treatment duration; wheezing; atopic dermatitis; clinical trial; infant; microclimate; proof of concept; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Environment, Controlled; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Proof of Concept Study",,,"Airsonett",,"NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre, BRC","The study was funded by the Imperial College NIHR Biomedical Research Centre.

The invasiveness of biopsies has prevented their use in defining individual-level AD pathobiological mechanisms (endotypes) in large research studies. Objective: We sought to determine whether minimally invasive skin tape strip transcriptome analysis identifies gene expression dysregulation in AD and molecular disease endotypes. Methods: We sampled nonlesional and lesional skin tape strips and biopsy specimens from white adult patients with AD (18 male and 12 female patients; age [mean ± SE], 36.3 ± 2.2 years) and healthy control subjects (9 male and 16 female subjects; age [mean ± SE], 34.8 ± 2.2 years). AmpliSeq whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed on extracted RNA. Differential expression, clustering/pathway analyses, immunostaining of skin biopsy specimens, and clinical trait correlations were performed. Results: Skin tape expression profiles were distinct from skin biopsy profiles and better sampled epidermal differentiation complex genes. Skin tape expression of 29 immune and epidermis-related genes (false discovery rate &lt; 5%) separated patients with AD from healthy subjects. Agnostic gene set analyses and clustering revealed 50% of patients with AD exhibited a type 2 inflammatory signature (type 2–high endotype) characterized by differential expression of 656 genes, including overexpression of IL13, IL4R, CCL22, CCR4 (log 2 fold change = 5.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 4.1, respectively) and at a pathway level by T H 2/dendritic cell activation. Both expression and immunostaining of skin biopsy specimens indicated this type 2–high group was enriched for inflammatory, type 2–skewed dendritic cells expressing FcεRI. The type 2–high endotype group exhibited more severe disease by using both the Eczema Area and Severity Index score and body surface area covered by lesions. Conclusion: Minimally invasive expression profiling of nonlesional skin reveals stratification in AD molecular pathology by type 2 inflammation that correlates with disease severity. © 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","atopic dermatitis; inflammation; RNA sequencing; Skin; type 2 immune response","chemokine receptor CCR4; Fc epsilon RI protein; interleukin 13; macrophage derived chemokine; protein; RNA; unclassified drug; transcriptome; adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; cell differentiation; controlled study; dendritic cell; disease severity; epidermis cell; female; gene expression; gene expression profiling; human; human tissue; IL4R gene; immunohistochemistry; intermethod comparison; lymphocyte activation; male; minimally invasive procedure; priority journal; protein expression; RNA sequence; skin biopsy; skin examination; skin tape strip technique; Th2 cell; transcriptomics; type 2 high atopic dermatitis; atopic dermatitis; case control study; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; devices; gene expression profiling; genetic marker; genetic screening; genetics; procedures; sequence analysis; severity of illness index; surgical tape; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Genetic Markers; Genetic Testing; Humans; Male; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Severity of Illness Index; Surgical Tape; Transcriptome",,"chemokine receptor CCR4, 169936-75-8; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0; protein, 67254-75-5; RNA, 63231-63-0; Genetic Markers",,,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: R01HL128439, R01HL135156

Specific objectives were: (1) to determine whether choice of method affects the composition of these patterns and (2) to consider the potential application of each method in the clinical setting. Design Cross-sectional study. Diagnoses were based on the 263 corresponding blocks of the International Classification of Diseases version 10. Multimorbidity patterns were identified using HCA and EFA. Analysis was stratified by sex, and results compared for each method. Setting and participants Electronic health records for 408 994 patients with multimorbidity aged 45-64 years in 274 primary health care teams from 2010 in Catalonia, Spain. Results HCA identified 53 clusters for women, with just 12 clusters including at least 2 diagnoses, and 15 clusters for men, all of them including at least two diagnoses. EFA showed 9 factors for women and 10 factors for men. We observed differences by sex and method of analysis, although some patterns were consistent. Three combinations of diseases were observed consistently across sex groups and across both methods: Hypertension and obesity, spondylopathies and deforming dorsopathies, and dermatitis eczema and mycosis. Conclusions This study showed that multimorbidity patterns vary depending on the method of analysis used (HCA vs EFA) and provided new evidence about the known limitations of attempts to compare multimorbidity patterns in real-world data studies. We found that EFA was useful in describing comorbidity relationships and HCA could be useful for in-depth study of multimorbidity. Our results suggest possible applications for each of these methods in clinical and research settings, and add information about some aspects that must be considered in standardisation of future studies: Spectrum of diseases, data usage and methods of analysis. © 2018 Article author(s).","cluster analysis; diseases; electronic health records; factor analysis; multimorbidity; primary health care","adult; Article; Catalonia; cluster analysis; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; deforming dorsopathy; dermatitis; eczema; electronic health record; exploratory factor analysis; female; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; multiple chronic conditions; mycosis; obesity; sex difference; spondylopathy; urolithiasis; chronic disease; clinical trial; factor analysis; International Classification of Diseases; middle aged; multicenter study; organization and management; primary health care; Spain; Chronic Disease; Cluster Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Electronic Health Records; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; International Classification of Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Multimorbidity; Primary Health Care; Spain",,,,,"National Institute for Health Research, NIHR: NIHR/CS/010/024

Longitudinal birth cohort studies provide an opportunity to define subgroups on the basis of disease trajectories, which may represent different genetic and environmental pathomechanisms. Objectives: We sought to investigate the existence of distinct longitudinal phenotypes of AD and test whether these findings are reproducible in 2 independent cohorts. Methods: The presence of AD was examined in 2 birth cohort studies including 9894 children from the United Kingdom (ALSPAC) and 3652 from the Netherlands (PIAMA). AD was defined by parental report of a typical itchy and/or flexural rash. Longitudinal latent class analysis was used to investigate patterns of AD from birth to the age of 11 to 16 years. We investigated associations with known AD risk factors, including FLG null mutations, 23 other established AD-genetic risk variants, and atopic comorbidity. Results: Six latent classes were identified, representing subphenotypes of AD, with remarkable consistency between the 2 cohorts. The most prevalent class was early-onset-early-resolving AD, which was associated with male sex. Two classes of persistent disease were identified (early-onset-persistent and early-onset-late-resolving); these were most strongly associated with the AD-genetic risk score as well as personal and parental history of atopic disease. A yet unrecognized class of mid-onset-resolving AD, not associated with FLG mutations, but strongly associated with asthma, was identified. Conclusions: Six classes based on temporal trajectories of rash were consistently identified in 2 population-based cohorts. The differing risk factor profiles and diverse prognoses demonstrate the potential importance of a stratified medicine approach for AD. © 2017 The Authors","ALSPAC; Atopic dermatitis; eczema; environmental; genetic; latent class analysis; PIAMA","filaggrin; immunoglobulin E; regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1; regulator protein; STAT3 protein; transcription factor; unclassified drug; zinc finger containing transcription factor; zinc finger protein; filaggrin; intermediate filament protein; adolescent; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; breast feeding; child; cohort analysis; comorbidity; early onset early resolving atopic dermatitis; early onset late resolving atopic dermatitis; early onset persistent atopic dermatitis; environmental factor; family history; female; gene mutation; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variation; human; immunoglobulin blood level; late onset resolving atopic dermatitis; latent class analysis; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mid onset resolving atopic dermatitis; Netherlands; onset age; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; sex difference; single nucleotide polymorphism; transient atopic dermatitis; United Kingdom; clinical trial; follow up; genetics; immunology; infant; multicenter study; mutation; preschool child; young adult; Adolescent; Age of Onset; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Intermediate Filament Proteins; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mutation; Risk Factors; United Kingdom; Young Adult",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; filaggrin; Intermediate Filament Proteins",,,"Medical Research Council, MRC: MC_PC_15018, MC_UU_12013/4, MR/J012165/1",,,,,"Williams, H.C., Clinical practice: atopic dermatitis (2005) N Engl J Med, 352, pp. 2314-2324; Kim, J.P., Chao, L.X., Simpson, E.L., Silverberg, J.I., Persistence of atopic dermatitis (AD): a systematic review and meta-analysis (2016) J Am Acad Dermatol, 75, pp. 681-687.e11; Mortz, C.G., Andersen, K.E., Dellgren, C., Barington, T., Bindslev-Jensen, C., Atopic dermatitis from adolescence to adulthood in the TOACS cohort: prevalence, persistence and comorbidities (2015) Allergy, 70, pp. 836-845; Johansson, E.K., Ballardini, N., Bergstrom, A., Kull, I., Wahlgren, C.F., Atopic and nonatopic eczema in adolescence: is there a difference?

Yusho patients suffer from various symptoms; however, after 40 years, some emerging symptoms have been attributed to aging. The prevalence of symptoms and diseases among Yusho patients and the general population was compared in this study. The data obtained from the survey among Yusho patients (1131 patients) by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan in 2008 were compared with the data from a survey conducted among the general population. When selecting the comparison group, the age and residential area (prefecture) were taken into account to match the baseline characteristics of Yusho patients. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the association between Yusho and the prevalence of symptoms and was adjusted for various potential confounding factors (age, sex, body mass index, cigarette smoking, frequency of drinking, and walking time). Skin pigmentation and acneiform eruption were found to be characteristic symptoms of Yusho and were more prevalent in these patients. Other symptoms and diseases associated with Yusho included orthostatic hypotension, hypohidrosis, dysgeusia, Basedow’s disease, hoarseness, cardiac insufficiency, tachycardia, eczema, and hair loss. Symptoms related to aging, such as general fatigue, arthralgia, and numbness in the extremities, were significantly higher in Yusho patients after adjusting for age and lifestyle. This study demonstrated that, 40 years after the outbreak of Yusho, the prevalence of various symptoms and diseases in Yusho patients, including age-related diseases, was higher than that in the general population. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; rice bran oil; comparative study; disease prevalence; factor analysis; health impact; lifestyle; long-term change; PCB; poisoning; public health; survey method; symptom; acne; adult; aged; allergic rhinitis; alopecia; angina pectoris; anhidrosis; anxiety disorder; arthralgia; Article; asthma; astigmatism; atelectasis; atopic dermatitis; autonomic dysfunction; backache; Behcet disease; bipolar disorder; bladder cancer; bladder stone; bleeding; bloating; body mass; bone pain; brain infarction; breast cancer; cataract; cerebrovascular accident; cholecystitis; cholelithiasis; chronic bronchitis; chronic gastritis; cigarette smoking; colon polyp; constipation; controlled study; cystitis; dementia; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; drinking behavior; drug hypersensitivity; dry skin; duodenum ulcer; dysgeusia; dysmenorrhea; dyspnea; eczema; edema; emphysema; endometriosis; epidermoid cyst; epistaxis; esophagus cancer; fatigue; female; food allergy; fracture; frozen shoulder; gallbladder cancer; gingivitis; glaucoma; goiter; gout; Graves disease; hair loss; hallucination; headache; heart arrest; heart failure; heart infarction; heart palpitation; hemorrhoid; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; hoarseness; human; hyperhidrosis; hyperlipidemia; hypothyroidism; insomnia; intellectual impairment; intervertebral disk hernia; intestine cancer; intestine obstruction; irritable colon; kidney cancer; lifestyle; liver cancer; liver dysfunction; lung cancer; lung edema; lung fibrosis; major clinical study; male; male infertility; Meniere disease; menorrhagia; menstrual irregularity; middle aged; myalgia; myositis; nephritis; nephrolithiasis; oligomenorrhea; orthostatic hypotension; osteoporosis; osteosarcoma; otitis media; ovary cancer; ovary cyst; pancreas cancer; pancreatitis; periodontal disease; pneumonia; pollen allergy; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostate hypertrophy; proteinuria; purpura; pustulosis palmoplantaris; rheumatoid arthritis; schizophrenia; scleroderma; Sjoegren syndrome; skin cancer; skin pigmentation; skin pruritus; stomach cancer; stomach ulcer; symptom; systemic lupus erythematosus; tachycardia; taste disorder; thyroid cancer; thyroiditis; tongue cancer; tooth malformation; ureter stone; urticaria; uterus cancer; uterus myoma; vertigo; very elderly; walking; Yusho disease; brain disease; food contamination; Japan; porphyria; prevalence; skin disease; statistical model; Japan; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Diseases; Female; Food Contamination; Humans; Japan; Life Style; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Porphyrias; Prevalence; Rice Bran Oil; Skin Diseases",,"rice bran oil, 68553-81-1; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Rice Bran Oil",,,,"Acknowledgments The authors thank Y.

Despite recent advances in immunophenotypic and genetic discovery, clinical care of CVID remains limited by our inability to accurately model risk for non-infectious disease development. Herein, we demonstrate the utility of unbiased network clustering as a novel method to analyze inter-relationships between non-infectious disease outcomes in CVID using databases at the United States Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET), the centralized immunodeficiency registry of the United States, and Partners, a tertiary care network in Boston, MA, USA, with a shared electronic medical record amenable to natural language processing. Immunophenotypes were comparable in terms of native antibody deficiencies, low titer response to pneumococcus, and B cell maturation arrest. However, recorded non-infectious disease outcomes were more substantial in the Partners cohort across the spectrum of lymphoproliferation, cytopenias, autoimmunity, atopy, and malignancy. Using unbiased network clustering to analyze 34 non-infectious disease outcomes in the Partners cohort, we further identified unique patterns of lymphoproliferative (two clusters), autoimmune (two clusters), and atopic (one cluster) disease that were defined as CVID non-infectious endotypes according to discrete and non-overlapping immunophenotypes. Markers were both previously described [high serum IgE in the atopic cluster [odds ratio (OR) 6.5] and low class-switched memory B cells in the total lymphoproliferative cluster (OR 9.2)] and novel [low serum C3 in the total lymphoproliferative cluster (OR 5.1)]. Mortality risk in the Partners cohort was significantly associated with individual non-infectious disease outcomes as well as lymphoproliferative cluster 2, specifically (OR 5.9). In contrast, unbiased network clustering failed to associate known comorbidities in the adult USIDNET cohort. Together, these data suggest that unbiased network clustering can be used in CVID to redefine non-infectious disease inter-relationships; however, applicability may be limited to datasets well annotated through mechanisms such as natural language processing. The lymphoproliferative, autoimmune, and atopic Partners CVID endotypes herein described can be used moving forward to streamline genetic and biomarker discovery and to facilitate early screening and intervention in CVID patients at highest risk for autoimmune and inflammatory progression. © 2018 Farmer, Ong, Barmettler, Yonker, Fuleihan, Sullivan, Cunningham-Rundles, The USIDNET Consortium and Walter.","Atopy; Autoimmunity; Common variable immunodeficiency; Endotypes; Lymphoproliferation; Non-infectious complications; Unbiased network clustering","CD16 antigen; CD19 antigen; CD27 antigen; CD3 antigen; CD4 antigen; CD56 antigen; CD8 antigen; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; adult; aged; allergic rhinitis; alopecia; anemia; Article; asthma; autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome; B lymphocyte; cell infiltration; cell maturation; common variable immunodeficiency; computer assisted tomography; computer model; Crohn disease; eczema; follow up; human; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; immunophenotyping; inflammatory bowel disease; information processing; leukemia; lymphocyte proliferation; lymphocytopenia; lymphoma; major clinical study; medical record review; multiple myeloma; myelodysplastic syndrome; natural language processing; neutropenia; psoriasis; pulmonary hypertension; rheumatoid arthritis; Streptococcus pneumoniae; unbiased network clustering; urticaria; vitiligo",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; immunoglobulin M, 9007-85-6",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: T32-HL116275

Methods: A systematic search of the following online databases was performed: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, EconLit, Scopus, Health Technology Assessment, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and Web of Science. Papers were eligible for inclusion if they described a decision–analytic model evaluating both the costs and benefits associated with an intervention or prevention for atopic eczema. Data were extracted using a standardised form by two independent reviewers, whilst quality was assessed using the model-specific Philips criteria. Results: Twenty-four models were identified, evaluating either preventions (n = 12) or interventions (n = 12): 14 reported using a Markov modelling approach, four utilised decision trees and one a discrete event simulation, whilst five did not specify the approach. The majority, 22 studies, reported that the intervention was dominant or cost effective, given the assumptions and analytical perspective taken. Notably, the models tended to be short-term (16 used a time horizon of ≤1 year), often providing little justification for the limited time horizon chosen. The methodological and reporting quality of the studies was generally weak, with only seven studies fulfilling more than 50% of their applicable Philips criteria. Conclusions: This is the first systematic review of decision models in eczema. Whilst the majority of models reported favourable outcomes in terms of the cost effectiveness of the new intervention, the usefulness of these findings for decision-making is questionable. In particular, there is considerable scope for increasing the range of interventions evaluated, for improving modelling structures and reporting quality. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"atopic dermatitis; Cinahl; Cochrane Library; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; decision tree; economic evaluation; Embase; human; Markov chain; Medline; practice guideline; priority journal; quality control; Review; Scopus; systematic review; Web of Science; atopic dermatitis; cost benefit analysis; decision support system; economic model; economics; time factor; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Support Techniques; Decision Trees; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Markov Chains; Models, Economic; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Time Factors",,,,,"National Institute for Health Research, NIHR","Funding This work was funded as part of Professor Tracey Sach’s Career Development Fellowship (CDF award-2014-07-006) supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).

Design Pragmatic randomised open label superiority trial with two parallel groups. Setting 96 general practices in Wales and western and southern England. Participants 483 children aged 1 to 11 years, fulfilling UK diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis. Children with very mild eczema and children who bathed less than once weekly were excluded. Interventions Participants in the intervention group were prescribed emollient bath additives by their usual clinical team to be used regularly for 12 months. The control group were asked to use no bath additives for 12 months. Both groups continued with standard eczema management, including leave-on emollients, and caregivers were given standardised advice on how to wash participants. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was eczema control measured by the patient oriented eczema measure (POEM, scores 0-7 mild, 8-16 moderate, 17-28 severe) weekly for 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were eczema severity over one year (monthly POEM score from baseline to 52 weeks), number of eczema exacerbations resulting in primary healthcare consultation, disease specific quality of life (dermatitis family impact), generic quality of life (child health utility-9D), utilisation of resources, and type and quantity of topical corticosteroid or topical calcineurin inhibitors prescribed. Results 483 children were randomised and one child was withdrawn, leaving 482 children in the trial: 51% were girls (244/482), 84% were of white ethnicity (447/470), and the mean age was 5 years. 96% (461/482) of participants completed at least one post-baseline POEM, so were included in the analysis, and 77% (370/482) completed questionnaires for more than 80% of the time points for the primary outcome (12/16 weekly questionnaires to 16 weeks). The mean baseline POEM score was 9.5 (SD 5.7) in the bath additives group and 10.1 (SD 5.8) in the no bath additives group. The mean POEM score over the 16 week period was 7.5 (SD. 6.0) in the bath additives group and 8.4 (SD 6.0) in the no bath additives group. No statistically significant difference was found in weekly POEM scores between groups over 16 weeks. After controlling for baseline severity and confounders (ethnicity, topical corticosteroid use, soap substitute use) and allowing for clustering of participants within centres and responses within participants over time, POEM scores in the no bath additives group were 0.41 points higher than in the bath additives group (95% confidence interval â '0.27 to 1.10), below the published minimal clinically important difference for POEM of 3 points.

OBJECTIVE To investigate whether an intervention to promote prolonged and exclusive breastfeeding protects against asthma, atopic eczema, and low lung function in adolescence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Follow-up of the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT), a cluster randomized trial in 30 Belarusian maternity hospitals and affiliated polyclinics; recruitment of 17 046 healthy term infants took place from June 15, 1996, to December 31, 1997. Data analysis was conducted from May 9, 2016, to April 21, 2017. The primary analytic approach was by modified intention-to-treat analysis. INTERVENTIONS Randomization to receive a breastfeeding promotion intervention vs usual care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Spirometry and flexural eczema on standardized skin examination by study pediatricians were the primary outcomes; secondary outcomes were self-reported asthma diagnosis ever, and wheezing and flexural eczema symptoms in the previous year. RESULTS A total of 13 557 (79.5%) participants were followed up from September 15, 2012 to July 15, 2015. The intervention (7064 [79.7%]) and control (6493 [79.4%]) groups were similar at follow-up (3590 [50.8%] and 3391 [52.2%] male; mean [SD] age, 16.2 [0.6] and 16.1 [0.5] years, respectively). In the intervention group, 0.3%(21 of 7064) had flexural eczema on skin examination and mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio z score was -0.10 (1.82), compared with 0.7%(43 of 6493) and 0.35 (1.34), respectively, in the control group. In modified intention-to-treat analysis, accounting for clustering by polyclinic, a 54%lower risk of flexural eczema on skin examination was observed in the intervention compared with the control group (odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95%CI, 0.25 to 0.86). Self-reported flexural eczema symptoms in the past year (OR, 0.57; 95%CI, 0.27 to 1.18), asthma (OR, 0.76; 95%CI, 0.47 to 1.23), and wheezing in the past year (OR, 0.66; 95%CI, 0.37 to 1.18) were less frequently reported in the intervention compared with the control group, but 95%CIs were wide and included the null. There was no significant difference in the FEV1/FVC ratio z score (β -0.15; 95%CI, -0.76 to 0.45). All results were similar with additional adjustment for baseline characteristics, on instrumental variable analysis, and with multiple imputation among all 17 046 randomized participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A breastfeeding promotion intervention reduced flexural dermatitis risk but had no detectable effect on lung function or questionnaire-derived measures of atopic eczema or asthma in adolescence in a setting where atopic eczema and allergies are rare. © 2017 American Medical Association.

Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis can be difficult and costly to treat. The long-term health and economic outcomes of a new therapy, dupilumab, have yet to be evaluated. We aimed to identify the cost-effectiveness of dupilumab compared to usual care in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Methods. We compared dupilumab to usual care with emollients for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis inadequately controlled with topical therapy, or for whom topical therapies were medically inadvisable. Subpopulations of moderate and severe patients were examined separately. We used a lifetime Markov model from a US payer perspective with health states categorized by the percent decrease in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score after a patient began an intervention: At least a 50% decrease (EASI 50), 75% decrease (EASI 75), 90% decrease (EASI 90), or no response. Results. The expected lifetime cost for patients treated with dupilumab was $509,600, including $267,800 in dupilumab drug costs and $241,800 in other healthcare costs. Average lifetime cost for usual care was $271,500. Dupilumab provided an additional 1.91 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the remaining lifetime of a patient, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $124,500. The ICER was lower for patients with severe atopic dermatitis ($95,800) than those with moderate atopic dermatitis ($160,000). Key drivers of the model were utility values for quality-of-life for non-responders, and the price of dupilumab. Conclusions. This study was limited by data for health outcomes and costs over long time periods, particularly stratified by severity. We estimated that dupilumab improved health outcomes compared to usual care but with additional costs, with an ICER below commonly cited thresholds for cost-effectiveness. Dupilumab was projected to be more cost-effective in patients with severe atopic dermatitis, but even in patients with moderate atopic dermatitis, the ICER remained below the upper range of commonly cited thresholds. © 2018 Journal of Drugs in Dermatology.",,"dupilumab; emollient agent; dupilumab; emollient agent; IL4R protein, human; interleukin 4 receptor alpha; monoclonal antibody; adult; allergic conjunctivitis; Article; atopic dermatitis; conjunctivitis; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; drug cost; female; health care cost; human; infectious conjunctivitis; injection site reaction; loading drug dose; male; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; topical treatment; antagonists and inhibitors; atopic dermatitis; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; drug administration; economic model; economics; Markov chain; severity of illness index; subcutaneous drug administration; treatment outcome; United States; Adult; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Costs; Emollients; Female; Humans; Injections, Subcutaneous; Interleukin-4 Receptor alpha Subunit; Male; Markov Chains; Models, Economic; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome; United States",,"dupilumab, 1190264-60-8; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Emollients; IL4R protein, human; Interleukin-4 Receptor alpha Subunit; SAR231893",,,,,,,,"Shaw, T.E., Currie, G.P., Koudelka, C.W., Simpson, E.L., Eczema prevalence in the United States: Data from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health (2011) J Invest Dermatol, 131 (1), pp. 67-73; Silverberg, J.I., Hanifin, J.M., Adult eczema prevalence and associations with asthma and other health and demographic factors: A US population-based study (2013) J Allery Clin Immunol, 132 (5), pp. 1132-1138; Silverberg, J.I., Garg, N.K., Paller, A.S., Fishbein, A.B., Zee, P.C., Sleep disturbances in adults with eczema are associated with impaired overall health: A US population-based study (2015) J Invest Dermatol, 135 (1), pp. 56-66; Holm, J.G., Agner, T., Clausen, M.L., Thomsen, S.F., Quality of life and disease severity in patients with atopic dermatitis (2016) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 30 (10), pp. 1760-1767; Yu, S.H., Attarian, H., Zee, P., Silverberg, J.I., Burden of sleep and fatigue in US adults with atopic dermatitis (2016) Dermatitis: Contact, Atopic, Occupational, Drug, 27 (2), pp. 50-58; Weidinger, S., Novak, N., Atopic dermatitis (2016) Lancet (London, England), 387 (10023), pp. 1109-1122; Katz, H.I., Prawer, S.E., Mooney, J.J., Samson, C.R., Preatrophy: Covert sign of thinned skin (1989) J Am Acad Dermatol, 20 (5 PART 1), pp. 731-735; Furue, M., Terao, H., Rikihisa, W., Clinical dose and adverse effects of topical steroids in daily management of atopic dermatitis (2003) Br J Dermatol, 148 (1), pp. 128-133; Lam, L.H., Sugarman, J.L., Adrenal suppression with chronic topical corticosteroid use in psoriasis patients (2016) J Drugs Dermatol, 15 (8), pp. 945-948; Simpson, E.L., Bieber, T., Guttman-Yassky, E., Two phase 3 trials of dupilumab versus placebo in atopic dermatitis (2016) New Engl J Med, 375 (24), pp. 2335-2348; Thaci, D., Chambers, C., Sidhu, M., Dorsch, B., Ehlken, B., Fuchs, S., Twice-weekly treatment with tacrolimus 0.03% ointment in children with atopic dermatitis: Clinical efficacy and economic impact over 12 months (2010) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 24 (9), pp. 1040-1046; Beck, L.A., Thaçi, D., Hamilton, J.D., Dupilumab treatment in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (2014) New Engl J Med, 371 (2), pp. 130-139; Sanofi-Regeneron.

Cancer survivors (CS) reported higher use of prescribed medication, with greater adjusted PR among men (1.25 vs. 1.13, P for interaction=0.001). Compared with the general population, male CS reported higher use of drugs for sleep problems, allergies and antibiotics, whereas female CS reported greater consumption of drugs for depression, anxiety, sleep problems and pain.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of improvements in LUTS using International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), voiding subscore of IPSS (voiding IPSS), storage subscore of IPSS (storage IPSS), quality of life (QoL), maximal urinary flow rate (Qmax), and post-voided residual volume (PVR), and also investigated adverse events and relevant withdrawal rate. Results: Final included studies were 28 studies with 19,820 subjects (9800 treatment group and 10,020 control group). The overall weighted mean differences of total IPSS, voiding IPSS, storage IPSS, and QoL showed significant improvement. Single placebo group showed significant improvement in all outcomes except PVR. The weighted prevalence of overall withdrawal rate and adverse event-specific withdrawal rate was 10 and 3%, respectively. Meta-regression showed that baseline IPSS, dosage of PDE 5I, and country affect clinical improvement compared with placebo. Conclusions: This study clarifies the efficacy of PDE 5I on treatment of BPH/LUTS as an initial treatment strategy. However, baseline IPSS, dosage of PDE 5I and country affected the clinical improvement. Moreover, adverse event-specific withdrawal rate was not as high as suspected based on the overall withdrawal rate. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Lower urinary tract symptoms; Meta-analysis; Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor; Placebo; Prostatic hyperplasia","phosphodiesterase V inhibitor; placebo; sildenafil; tadalafil; vardenafil; phosphodiesterase V inhibitor; placebo; Article; backache; clinical outcome; diarrhea; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; dyspepsia; eczema; factor analysis; gastroesophageal reflux; headache; human; International Prostate Symptom Score; limb pain; lower urinary tract symptom; meta analysis; micturition; muscle spasm; myalgia; postvoid residual urine volume; prevalence; prostate hypertrophy; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); regression analysis; rhinopharyngitis; scoring system; side effect; systematic review; urine flow rate; complication; lower urinary tract symptom; male; prostate hypertrophy; severity of illness index; Humans; Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms; Male; Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors; Placebos; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Quality of Life; Regression Analysis; Severity of Illness Index",,"sildenafil, 139755-83-2; tadalafil, 171596-29-5; vardenafil, 224785-90-4, 224785-91-5, 224789-15-5; Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors; Placebos",,,,"Funding This work was supported by Soonchunyang University Research Fund.",,,,"Wei, J.T., Calhoun, E., Jacobsen, S.J., Urologic diseases in America project: benign prostatic hyperplasia (2008) J Urol, 179, pp. S75-S80. , PID: 18405761; Gratzke, C., Bachmann, A., Descazeaud, A., Drake, M.J., Madersbacher, S., Mamoulakis, C., Oelke, M., Gravas, S., EAU guidelines on the assessment of non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms including benign prostatic obstruction (2015) Eur Urol, 67, pp. 1099-1109. , PID: 25613154; Wang, C., Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and benign prostatic hyperplasia (2010) Curr Opin Urol, 20, pp. 49-54. , PID: 19887943; Dong, Y., Hao, L., Shi, Z., Wang, G., Zhang, Z., Han, C., Efficacy and safety of tadalafil monotherapy for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia: a meta-analysis (2013) Urol Int, 91, pp. 10-18. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXhtFyhsbbF, PID: 23816815; Gacci, M., Corona, G., Salvi, M., Vignozzi, L., McVary, K.T., Kaplan, S.A., Roehrborn, C.G., Maggi, M., A systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors alone or in combination with alpha-blockers for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (2012) Eur Urol, 61, pp. 994-1003. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38Xjs1Wgsrs%3D, PID: 22405510; Laydner, H.K., Oliveira, P., Oliveira, C.R., Makarawo, T.P., Andrade, W.S., Tannus, M., Araujo, J.L., Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review (2011) BJU Int, 107, pp. 1104-1109. , PID: 20883484; DerSimonian, R., Laird, N., Meta-analysis in clinical trials (1986) Control Clin Trials, 7, pp. 177-188. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaL2s7gsVamtA%3D%3D, PID: 3802833; McVary, K.T., Roehrborn, C.G., Avins, A.L., Barry, M.J., Bruskewitz, R.C., Donnell, R.F., Foster, H.E., Jr., Wei, J.T., Update on AUA guideline on the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (2011) J Urol, 185, pp. 1793-1803. , PID: 21420124; Liu, L., Zheng, S., Han, P., Wei, Q., Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2011) Urology, 77, pp. 123-129. , PID: 21195830; Oelke, M., Giuliano, F., Mirone, V., Xu, L., Cox, D., Viktrup, L., Monotherapy with tadalafil or tamsulosin similarly improved lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia in an international, randomised, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical trial (2012) Eur Urol, 61, pp. 917-925. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XltVyrtLg%3D, PID: 22297243; Untergasser, G., Madersbacher, S., Berger, P., Benign prostatic hyperplasia: age-related tissue-remodeling (2005) Exp Gerontol, 40, pp. 121-128. , PID: 15763388; Tinel, H., Stelte-Ludwig, B., Hutter, J., Sandner, P., Pre-clinical evidence for the use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms (2006) BJU Int, 98, pp. 1259-1263. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2sXktlakuw%3D%3D, PID: 16956354; Shim, S.R., Kim, J.H., Choi, H., Lee, W.J., Kim, H.J., Bae, M.Y., Hwang, S.D., Yoon, S.J., General effect of low-dose tamsulosin (0.2 mg) as a first-line treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2015) Curr Med Res Opin, 31, pp. 353-365. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXjt1agtr4%3D, PID: 25350225; Shim, S.R., Kim, J.H., Chang, I.H., Shin, I.S., Hwang, S.D., Kim, K.H., Yoon, S.J., Song, Y.S., Is Tamsulosin 0.2 mg effective and safe as a first-line treatment compared with other alpha blockers?

Objectives: To develop and validate a dermatology-specific QoL instrument for adolescents with skin diseases. Methods: Qualitative semistructured interviews were conducted with adolescents with skin disease to gain in-depth understanding of how skin diseases affect their QoL. A prototype instrument based on the themes identified from content analysis of interviews was tested in several stages, using classical test theory and item response theory models to develop this new tool and conduct its psychometric evaluation. Results: Thirty-three QoL issues were identified from semistructured interviews with 50 adolescents. A questionnaire based on items derived from content analysis of interviews was subjected to Rasch analysis: factor analysis identified three domains, therefore not supporting the validity of T-QoL as a unidimensional measure. Psychometric evaluation of the final 18-item questionnaire was carried out in a cohort of 203 adolescents. Convergent validity was demonstrated by significant correlation with Skindex-Teen and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) or Children's DLQI. The T-QoL showed excellent internal consistency reliability: Cronbach's α = 0·89 for total scale score and 0·85, 0·60 and 0·74, respectively, for domains 1, 2 and 3. Test–retest reliability was high in stable volunteers. T-QoL showed sensitivity to change in two subgroups of patients who indicated change in their self-assessed disease severity. Conclusions: Built on rich qualitative data from patients, the T-QoL is a simple and valid tool to quantify the impact of skin disease on adolescents’ QoL; it could be used as an outcome measure in both clinical practice and clinical research. © 2017 British Association of Dermatologists",,"acne; adolescent; adult; Article; child; conceptual framework; content analysis; controlled study; convergent validity; dermatitis; dermatology; Dermatology Life Quality Index; disease severity; eczema; female; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; priority journal; psoriasis; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; Rasch analysis; semi structured interview; skin disease; verruca vulgaris; body image; cohort analysis; daily life activity; psychology; reproducibility; self concept; severity of illness index; skin disease; standards; validation study; Activities of Daily Living; Adolescent; Body Image; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Self Concept; Severity of Illness Index; Skin Diseases; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,,"No external funding was obtained for this study; the study was funded by Cardiff University Dermatology Department quality-of-life research fund.",,,,"Golics, C.J., Basra, M.K.A., Finlay, A.Y., Salek, M.S., Adolescents with skin disease have specific quality of life issues (2009) Dermatology, 218, pp. 357-366; Finlay, A.Y., Khan, G.K., Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) – a simple practical measure for routine clinical use (1994) Clin Exp Dermatol, 19, pp. 210-216; Basra, M.K.A., Fenech, R., Gatt, R.M., The Dermatology Life Quality Index 1994–2007: a comprehensive review of validation data and clinical results (2008) Br J Dermatol, 159, pp. 997-1035; Lewis-Jones, M.S., Finlay, A.Y., The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI): initial validation and practical use (1995) Br J Dermatol, 132, pp. 942-949; Salek, M.S., Jung, S., Brincat-Ruffini, L.A., Clinical experience and psychometric properties of the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI), 1995–2012 (2013) Br J Dermatol, 169, pp. 734-759; van Geel, M.J., Maatkamp, M., Oostveen, A.M., Comparison of the Dermatology Life Quality Index and the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index in assessment of quality of life in patients with psoriasis aged 16–17 years (2016) Br J Dermatol, 174, pp. 152-157; Frisen, A., Measuring health-related quality of life in adolescence (2007) Acta Paediatr, 96, pp. 963-968; Halvorsen, J.A., Braae Olesen, A., Thoresen, M., Comparison of self-reported skin complaints with objective skin signs among adolescents (2008) Acta Derm Venereol, 88, pp. 573-577; Ogedegbe, E.E., Henshaw, E.B., Severity and impact of acne vulgaris on the quality of life of adolescents in Nigeria (2014) Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol, 7, pp. 329-334; Tuong, W., Wang, A.S., Armstrong, A.W., Effect of automated online counseling on clinical outcomes and quality of life among adolescents with acne vulgaris: a randomized clinical trial (2015) JAMA Dermatol, 151, pp. 970-975; Chamlin, S.L., Chren, M.-M., Quality-of-life outcomes and measurement in childhood atopic dermatitis (2010) Immunol Allergy Clin North Am, 30, pp. 281-288; Slattery, M.J., Essex, M.J., Paletz, E.M., Depression, anxiety, and dermatologic quality of life in adolescents with atopic dermatitis (2011) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 128, pp. 668-671; Gonzalez, J., Cunningham, K., Perlmutter, J., Gottlieb, A., Systematic review of health-related quality of life in adolescents with psoriasis (2016) Dermatology, 232, pp. 541-549; Smidt, A.C., Lai, J.S., Cella, D., Development and validation of Skindex-Teen, a quality-of-life instrument for adolescents with skin diseases (2010) Arch Dermatol, 146, pp. 865-869; Baker, S.E., Edwards, R., Doidge, M., How many qualitative interviews is enough?

We hypothesized that sensitization develops as specific patterns with respect to age at debut, development over time, and involved allergens and that such patterns might be more biologically and clinically relevant. Objective We sought to explore latent patterns of sensitization during the first 6 years of life and investigate whether such patterns associate with the development of asthma, rhinitis, and eczema. Methods We investigated 398 children from the at-risk Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2000 (COPSAC2000) birth cohort with specific IgE against 13 common food and inhalant allergens at the ages of ½, 1½, 4, and 6 years. An unsupervised cluster analysis for 3-dimensional data (nonnegative sparse parallel factor analysis) was used to extract latent patterns explicitly characterizing temporal development of sensitization while clustering allergens and children. Subsequently, these patterns were investigated in relation to asthma, rhinitis, and eczema. Verification was sought in an independent unselected birth cohort (BAMSE) constituting 3051 children with specific IgE against the same allergens at 4 and 8 years of age. Results The nonnegative sparse parallel factor analysis indicated a complex latent structure involving 7 age- and allergen-specific patterns in the COPSAC2000 birth cohort data: (1) dog/cat/horse, (2) timothy grass/birch, (3) molds, (4) house dust mites, (5) peanut/wheat flour/mugwort, (6) peanut/soybean, and (7) egg/milk/wheat flour. Asthma was solely associated with pattern 1 (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5-7.2), rhinitis with patterns 1 to 4 and 6 (OR, 2.2-4.3), and eczema with patterns 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 (OR, 1.6-2.5). All 7 patterns were verified in the independent BAMSE cohort (R2 &gt; 0.89). Conclusion This study suggests the presence of specific sensitization patterns in early childhood differentially associated with development of clinical outcomes. Using such patterns in future research might provide more robust and clinically relevant results. © 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","asthma; children; eczema; patterns; rhinitis; Sensitization; specific IgE","allergen; immunoglobulin E; allergic rhinitis; Artemisia vulgaris; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; birch; cat; child; childhood disease; clinical outcome; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; Dermatophagoides; disease predisposition; dog; eczema; egg; female; horse; human; major clinical study; male; milk; mould; onset age; peanut; phenotype; Phleum pratense; preschool child; priority journal; school child; sensitization; soybean; wheat flour; age; allergic rhinitis; asthma; eczema; immunization; immunology; infant; newborn; prospective study; risk; statistics and numerical data; Sweden; Age Factors; Age of Onset; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Cohort Studies; Eczema; Female; Humans; Immunization; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Prospective Studies; Rhinitis, Allergic; Risk; Sweden",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,,"Malby Schoos, A.-M., Krogsgaard Chawes, B.L., Rasmussen, M.A., Bloch, J., Bønnelykke, K., Bisgaard, H., Atopic endotype in childhood (2016) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 137, pp. 844-851. , e4; Simpson, A., Tan, V.Y.F., Winn, J., Svensén, M., Bishop, C.M., Heckerman, D.E., Beyond atopy: multiple patterns of sensitization in relation to asthma in a birth cohort study (2010) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 181, pp. 1200-1206; Lazic, N., Roberts, G., Custovic, A., Belgrave, D., Bishop, C.M., Winn, J., Multiple atopy phenotypes and their associations with asthma: similar findings from two birth cohorts (2013) Allergy, 68, pp. 764-770; Stoltz, D.J., Jackson, D.J., Evans, M.D., Gangnon, R.E., Tisler, C.J., Gern, J.E., Specific patterns of allergic sensitization in early childhood and asthma and rhinitis risk (2013) Clin Exp Allergy, 43, pp. 233-241; Kull, I., Melen, E., Alm, J., Hallberg, J., Svartengren, M., van Hage, M., Breast-feeding in relation to asthma, lung function, and sensitization in young schoolchildren (2010) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 125, pp. 1013-1019; Bisgaard, H., The Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC): design, rationale, and baseline data from a longitudinal birth cohort study (2004) Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol, 93, pp. 381-389; Bisgaard, H., Hermansen, M.N., Buchvald, F., Loland, L., Halkjaer, L.B., Bønnelykke, K., Childhood asthma after bacterial colonization of the airway in neonates (2007) N Engl J Med, 357, pp. 1487-1495; Bisgaard, H., Hermansen, M.N., Loland, L., Halkjaer, L.B., Buchvald, F., Intermittent inhaled corticosteroids in infants with episodic wheezing (2006) N Engl J Med, 354, pp. 1998-2005; Wickman, M., Asarnoj, A., Tillander, H., Andersson, N., Bergström, A., Kull, I., Childhood-to-adolescence evolution of IgE antibodies to pollens and plant foods in the BAMSE cohort (2014) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 133, pp. 580-582; Ballardini, N., Nilsson, C., Nilsson, M., Lilja, G., ImmunoCAP Phadiatop Infant—a new blood test for detecting IgE sensitisation in children at 2 years of age (2006) Allergy, 61, pp. 337-343; Braun-Fahrländer, C., Wüthrich, B., Gassner, M., Grize, L., Sennhauser, F.H., Varonier, H.S., Validation of a rhinitis symptom questionnaire (ISAAC core questions) in a population of Swiss school children visiting the school health services.

IgE sensitization can occur through an impaired skin barrier. Filaggrin gene (FLG) mutation is associated with eczema and possibly also with IgE sensitization. Objective We sought to explore the longitudinal relation between preschool eczema (PSE), FLG mutation, or both and IgE sensitization in childhood. Methods A total of 3201 children from the BAMSE (Children Allergy Milieu Stockholm Epidemiology) birth cohort recruited from the general population were included. Regular parental questionnaires identified children with eczema. Blood samples were collected at 4, 8, and 16 years of age for analysis of specific IgE. FLG mutation analysis was performed on 1890 of the children. Results PSE was associated with IgE sensitization to both food allergens and aeroallergens up to age 16 years (overall adjusted odds ratio, 2.30; 95% CI, 2.00-2.66). This association was even stronger among children with persistent PSE. FLG mutation was associated with IgE sensitization to peanut at age 4 years (adjusted odds ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.03-3.44) but not to other allergens up to age 16 years. FLG mutation and PSE were not effect modifiers for the association between IgE sensitization and PSE or FLG mutation, respectively. Sensitized children with PSE were characterized by means of polysensitization, but no other specific IgE sensitization patterns were found. Conclusions PSE is associated with IgE sensitization to both food allergens and aeroallergens up to 16 years of age. FLG mutation is associated with IgE sensitization to peanut but not to other allergens. Sensitized children with preceding PSE are more often polysensitized. © 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Allergens; atopic dermatitis; birth cohort; filaggrin; food allergy; IgE; peanut; population; sensitization; skin barrier","filaggrin; food allergen; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E antibody; allergen; filaggrin; immunoglobulin E; intermediate filament protein; adolescent; age; Article; asthma; child; childhood; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; eczema; gene mutation; genetic association; human; major clinical study; peanut allergy; priority journal; rhinitis; risk assessment; secondary analysis; sensitization; Arachis; dna mutational analysis; eczema; female; food allergy; genetic association study; genetics; genotype; immunization; immunology; male; metabolism; mutation; pathology; preschool child; skin; Sweden; Adolescent; Allergens; Arachis; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; DNA Mutational Analysis; Eczema; Female; Food Hypersensitivity; Genetic Association Studies; Genotype; Humans; Immunization; Immunoglobulin E; Intermediate Filament Proteins; Male; Mutation; Skin; Sweden",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Allergens; filaggrin; Immunoglobulin E; Intermediate Filament Proteins",,,"261357

Understanding the metabolic mechanisms related to in utero vitamin D exposure may therefore shed light on complex disease susceptibility. Objective: The goal was to analyze the programming role of in utero vitamin D exposure on children’s metabolomics profiles. Design: First, unsupervised clustering was done with plasma metabolomics profiles from a case-control subset of 245 children aged 3 y with and without asthma from the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), in which pregnant women were randomly assigned to vitamin D supplementation or placebo. Thereafter, we analyzed the influence of maternal pre- and postsupplement vitamin D concentrations on cluster membership. Finally, we used the metabolites driving the clustering of children to identify the dominant metabolic pathways that were influential in each cluster. Results: We identified 3 clusters of children characterized by 1) high concentrations of fatty acids and amines and low maternal postsupplement vitamin D (mean 6 SD; 27.5 6 11.0 ng/mL), 2) high concentrations of amines, moderate concentrations of fatty acids, and normal maternal postsupplement vitamin D (34.0 6 14.1 ng/mL), and 3) low concentrations of fatty acids, amines, and normal maternal postsupplement vitamin D (35.2 6 15.9 ng/mL). Adjusting for sample storage time, maternal age and education, and both child asthma and vitamin D concentration at age 3 y did not modify the association between maternal postsupplement vitamin D and cluster membership (P = 0.0014). Maternal presupplement vitamin D did not influence cluster membership, whereas the combination of pre- and postsupplement concentrations did (P = 0.03). Conclusions: Young children can be clustered into distinct biologically meaningful groups by their metabolomics profiles. The clusters differed in concentrations of inflammatory mediators, and cluster membership was influenced by in utero vitamin D exposure, suggesting a prenatal programming role of vitamin D on the child’s metabolome.

Objective: To determine whether genetic variants in and around SPINK5 are associated with IgE-mediated food allergy. Method: We genotyped 71 “tag” single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag-SNPs) within a region spanning ~263 kb including SPINK5 (~61 kb) in n=722 (n=367 food-allergic, n=199 food-sensitized-tolerant and n=156 non-food-allergic controls) 12-month-old infants (discovery sample) phenotyped for food allergy with the gold standard oral food challenge. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measures were collected at 12 months from a subset (n=150) of these individuals. SNPs were tested for association with food allergy using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for ancestry strata. Association analyses were replicated in an independent sample group derived from four paediatric cohorts, total n=533 (n=203 food-allergic, n=330 non-food-allergic), mean age 2.5 years, with food allergy defined by either clinical history of reactivity, 95% positive predictive value (PPV) or challenge, corrected for ancestry by principal components. Results: SPINK5 variant rs9325071 (A⟶G) was associated with challenge-proven food allergy in the discovery sample (P=.001, OR=2.95, CI=1.49-5.83). This association was further supported by replication (P=.007, OR=1.58, CI=1.13-2.20) and by meta-analysis (P=.0004, OR=1.65). Variant rs9325071 is associated with decreased SPINK5 gene expression in the skin in publicly available genotype-tissue expression data, and we generated preliminary evidence for association of this SNP with elevated TEWL also. Conclusions: We report, for the first time, association between SPINK5 variant rs9325071 and challenge-proven IgE-mediated food allergy. © 2017 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

We examined the relationship between timing and patterns of food introduction and sensitization to foods at age 1 year in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort study. Methods: Nutrition questionnaire data prospectively collected at age 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months were used to determine timing of introduction of cow's milk products, egg, and peanut. At age 1 year, infants underwent skin prick testing to cow's milk, egg white, and peanut. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the impact of timing of food exposures on sensitization outcomes, and latent class analysis was used to study patterns of food introduction within the cohort. Results: Among 2124 children with sufficient data, delaying introduction of cow's milk products, egg, and peanut beyond the first year of life significantly increased the odds of sensitization to that food (cow's milk adjOR 3.69, 95% CI 1.37-9.08; egg adjOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.25-2.80; peanut adjOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.07-3.01). Latent class analysis produced a three-class model: early, usual, and delayed introduction. A pattern of delayed introduction, characterized by avoidance of egg and peanut during the first year of life, increased the odds of sensitization to any of the three tested foods (adjOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.26-2.49). Conclusions: Avoidance of potentially allergenic foods during the first year of life significantly increased the odds of sensitization to the corresponding foods. © 2017 The Authors.

Correct aetiological diagnosis is important for health surveillance. Objectives This study aims to test whether work-related (WR) allergen-induced symptoms are associated with a cytokine profile distinct from that due to irritants. Methods In a cross-sectional study (n=114), WR respiratory and/or skin symptoms were assessed through a standardised clinical examination and sensitisation to rat and/or mouse allergen determined by serum immunoglobulin E. Serum cytokine concentrations were measured by multiplex assays. The predefined cytokine profiles 'sensitiser' (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, eotaxin-1) and 'irritation' (IL-8, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22) were considered positive, when ≥3 concentrations exceeded the 95th percentile of the asymptomatic non-sensitised group. Results were examined by hierarchical clustering analyses (HCA) and multiple linear regression. Explorative analyses were carried out for nine additional cytokines. Exposure to allergens and endotoxin was assessed in a subpopulation. Results The prevalence of the profile 'irritation' was comparable in 28 symptomatic non-sensitised workers and 71 asymptomatic non-sensitised workers. HCA showed that nearly all symptomatic non-sensitised workers were gathered in two subclusters, characterised by high IL-17A levels, but different IL-8 levels. Multiple linear regression identified drug consumption and current complaints as confounders. Sensitised subjects were too few (n=14) for testing the profile 'sensitiser'. Conclusions In this unselected population of LA workers, the profile 'irritation' did not prove to be a valuable health surveillance tool. Low power precluded assessment of the profile 'sensitiser'. The increased IL-17A concentration may originate from irritative constituents of organic dust. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

The isolate produced numerous chlamydospores and sparse aleuroconidia, was resistant to cycloheximide, grew well on human stratum corneum samples and was positive in tests for urease production and hair perforation, but no dermatophyte could be identified. After several weeks, cleistothecia with delicate asci and disc-shaped ascospores were formed, suggesting Arachnomyces spp. The analyses of the ribosomal ITS and LSU (D1/D2 domains) nucleotide sequences proved a good match with the ex-type strain of Xanthothecium peruvianum (family Onygenaceae, order Onygenales), and LSU sequence showed 99% similarity with Arachnomyces glareosus. This is the first report of X. peruvianum isolated from human skin. The description of our isolate provides new information about this species and proposes its transfer to the genus Arachnomyces with the subsequent emendation of the description of Arachnomyces peruvianus.

Methods This paper utilized data from two waves of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, a cohort study that follows a representative population of children in Australia. This paper examined data from Waves 4 and 5 of the LSAC (covering the period 2010–2012) and included 3974 children aged 10–11 years at Wave 4 (51.4% male). Multiple dimensions of sleep quality were assessed using a combination of child- and parent-reported measures. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed through the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Results Latent class analysis indicated six distinct sleep quality classes in children, namely good sleep, moderate sleep quality, mild sleep disturbances, short sleep, long sleep, and disordered sleep. In general, the disordered sleep and minor sleep disturbance classes had poorer HRQOL, which worsened over time. The long sleep and moderate sleep quality classes also showed some decreases in HRQOL over time. Conclusions This study demonstrates that there are distinct sleep quality subtypes in children that could have implications for HRQOL. These findings may inform future strategies to promote improved sleep and HRQOL in children. © 2017","Latent change score; Physical health; Psychosocial health; Sleep quality subtypes","adolescent; anxiety;

Methods: We examined the relationship between maternal dietary patterns assessed using 24-h recalls and food diaries at 26-28 weeks of pregnancy and the subsequent development of allergic outcomes in the offspring in the Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort. Exploratory factor analysis was used to characterize maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy. During repeated visits in the first 36 months of life, questionnaires were administered to ascertain allergic symptoms, namely, eczema, rhinitis, and wheeze. At ages 18 and 36 months, we administered skin-prick testing to inhalant and food allergens. Results: Of the 3 maternal dietary patterns that emerged, the seafood and noodles pattern was associated with a reduced risk of developing allergen sensitization at both 18 months (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.7 [0.5-0.9]) and 36 months (0.7 [0.6-0.9]) after adjustment for a family history of allergy, and ethnicity, sex, and maternal education levels. No associations between the patterns vegetables, fruit, and white rice or pasta, cheese, and processed meat were observed with any of the allergic outcomes in the first 18 and 36 months of life. Conclusion: Maternal diet during pregnancy can influence the subsequent development of allergic outcomes in offspring. © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

For atopy, definition of phenotypes during childhood is less clear. Objective We sought to define phenotypes of atopic sensitization over the first 6 years of life using a latent class analysis (LCA) integrating 3 dimensions of atopy: allergen specificity, time course, and levels of specific IgE (sIgE). Methods Phenotypes were defined by means of LCA in 680 children of the Multizentrische Allergiestudie (MAS) and 766 children of the Protection against allergy: Study in Rural Environments (PASTURE) birth cohorts and compared with classical nondisjunctive definitions of seasonal, perennial, and food sensitization with respect to atopic diseases and lung function. Cytokine levels were measured in the PASTURE cohort. Results The LCA classified predominantly by type and multiplicity of sensitization (food vs inhalant), allergen combinations, and sIgE levels. Latent classes were related to atopic disease manifestations with higher sensitivity and specificity than the classical definitions. LCA detected consistently in both cohorts a distinct group of children with severe atopy characterized by high seasonal sIgE levels and a strong propensity for asthma; hay fever; eczema; and impaired lung function, also in children without an established asthma diagnosis. Severe atopy was associated with an increased IL-5/IFN-γ ratio. A path analysis among sensitized children revealed that among all features of severe atopy, only excessive sIgE production early in life affected asthma risk. Conclusions LCA revealed a set of benign, symptomatic, and severe atopy phenotypes. The severe phenotype emerged as a latent condition with signs of a dysbalanced immune response. It determined high asthma risk through excessive sIgE production and directly affected impaired lung function. © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","asthma; atopic diseases; Atopy; cytokines; epidemiology; IgE; latent class analysis; lung function; path analysis; sensitization; severe atopy; unsupervised clustering","allergen; cytokine; food allergen; gamma interferon; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 5; allergen; cytokine; immunoglobulin E; antibody production; Article; asthma; atopy; cohort analysis; disease severity; eczema; female; forced expiratory volume; human; immunoglobulin blood level; latent class analysis; lung function; male; path analysis; phenotype; pollen allergy; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; sensitivity and specificity; sensitization; wheezing; blood; child; hypersensitivity; immunology; infant; pathophysiology; phenotype; preschool child; Allergens; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Cytokines; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunoglobulin E; Infant; Male; Phenotype",,"gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Allergens; Cytokines; Immunoglobulin E",,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 250268

Unfortunately, currently it is not possible to predict based on the available criteria in which patients the cancer will progress and which patients will experience an indolent disease course. Furthermore, at early stages this malignancy often masquerades as psoriasis, chronic eczema or other benign inflammatory dermatoses. As a result, it takes on average 6 y to diagnose this lymphoma since its initial presentation. In this study, we performed transcription expression profiling using TruSeq targeted RNA gene expression on 181 fresh and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin samples from CTCL patients and patients affected by benign inflammatory dermatoses that often mimic CTCL clinically and on histology (e.g., psoriasis, chronic eczema, etc.) We also analyzed multiple longitudinal biopsies that were obtained from the same patients over time. Our results underscore significant molecular heterogeneity with respect to gene expression between different patients and even within the same patients over time. Our study also confirmed TOX, FYB, LEF1, CCR4, ITK, EED, POU2AF, IL26, STAT5, BLK, GTSF1 and PSORS1C2 genes as being differentially expressed between CTCL and benign skin biopsies. In addition, we found that differential expression for a subset of these markers (e.g., TOX, FYB, GTSF1 and CCR4) may be useful in prognosticating this disease. This research, combined with other molecular analyses, prepares the foundation for the development of personalized molecular approach toward diagnosis and management of CTCL. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL); diagnostic markers; expression profiling; Mycosis Fungoides (MF); prognostic markers; Sézary Syndrome (SS)","chemokine receptor CCR4; interleukin 26; STAT5 protein; adult; Article; BLK gene; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; CCR4 gene; cluster analysis; controlled study; cutaneous T cell lymphoma; EED gene; ethnicity; female; FYB gene; gene expression; genetic analysis; genetic transcription; GTSF1 gene; human; human tissue; IL26 gene; ITK gene; LEF1 gene; major clinical study; male; middle aged; polymerase chain reaction; POU2AF gene; PSORS1C2 gene; reverse transcription; RNA analysis; RNA extraction; RNA gene; skin biopsy; STAT5 gene; TOX gene; tumor gene",,"chemokine receptor CCR4, 169936-75-8",,,,,,,,"Olsen, E., Vonderheid, E., Pimpinelli, N., Willemze, R., Kim, Y., Knobler, R., Zackheim, H., Lamberg, S., Revisions to the staging and classification of Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary syndrome: a proposal of the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the cutaneous lymphoma task force of the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) (2007) Blood, 110, pp. 1713-1722. , 17540844; Jawed, S.I., Myskowski, P.L., Horwitz, S., Moskowitz, A., Querfeld, C., Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary syndrome): part I.

The aim of this study was to analyze in cluster a cohort of children allergic to peanuts and assessed for cross-reactivity to nuts and legumes and to identify different phenotypes. Methods: We included retrospectively 317 children with peanut allergy evaluated at the Allergy Unit of the Saint Vincent Hospital of Lille in the last 12 years. A complete workup for peanut allergy and nuts and legumes was carried out for each patient. A hierarchical agglomerative clustering method was used to search for clusters of individuals in the evaluated cohort. Results: Cross-allergy to TN and/or other legumes was identified in 137 patients (43.2%), atopic dermatitis being a major risk factor (adjusted OR = 16 [95% CI: 7.4–37]; p < 0.001). Three phenotypes emerged from cluster analysis. Cluster 1 (72 patients) is characterized by high level of rAra h 2, low threshold reactive doses for peanut and high proportion of asthma; Cluster 2 (93 patients) is characterized by high threshold reactive doses for peanut and the lowest proportion of cross-allergy to TN and/or legumes; Cluster 3 (152 patients) has a high risk of cross-allergy to TN and/or legumes and most patients suffer from eczema. Conclusions: The three phenotypes highlighted by this study could be useful to identify children with high risk of cross-allergic reaction to TNs and legumes early after PA diagnosis. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Jouberte Wey, 290 - Vergueiro, Sorocaba - SP, CEP: 18030-070, Brazil","Introduction: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that not only constitutes a public health issue, but also compromises the development of children affected by the condition. Its multifactorial origin suggests that the association of certain factors, such as low maternal education, passive smoking, inadequate hygiene and immunization and limited breast-feeding, causes higher asthma incidence. Study design: descriptive study. Aims of the study: to determine the profile and factors associated to the asthmatic children participating in the Asthma Control Program at the Health Center of Vitória Régia, Sorocaba/SP. Methods: Descriptive study conducted with the infant population of the Asthma Control Program, composed of 42 children. Children between 5 and 7 years old were included in the study and, as an exclusion criterion, children whose responsible did not agree to participate in the research. During the period of October 2014 to April 2015 questionnaires were applied to the responsible for the participating minor, after signature of a written informed consent. The collected data were analyzed by multivariate statistics. Results: Results indicated that the participating children are majorly male (66.7%), without history of intrauterine exposure to tobacco(89,7%) or passive smoking (69,2%), and received exclusive breast-feeding (92,3%) until approximately 5 months of age. The majority of children did not present diarrhea or respiratory infections in the first year of life and were not diagnosed with rhinitis and/or eczema. However, we verified that most infants have family history of asthma and/or atopy. The factorial analysis showed that the first three factors describe 80,71% of the variability of the sample. Statistically, the variables gender, animal presence, rhinitis and/or eczema diagnosis and breastfeeding stand out in the description of the studied population. Conclusions: We concluded that the findings of this study are, in many of the analyzed items, compatible with current literature. Variables such as gender and animal presence were consistent with findings from other studies, even considering the convenience sample. Regarding breastfeeding and its duration, the results contradict some scientific references, reinforcing that conclusions are conflicting in this aspect. Despite many studies that refer a beneficial effect of breastfeeding on the prevention of asthma, this variable was strongly associated to the analyzed sample. The application of a multivariate analysis allowed the identification of the variables most relevant to this group, among the main existing risk factors for asthma.","Asthma; Breast feeding; Health centers; Health profile; Sex distribution","Article; asthma; Brazil; breast feeding; child; clinical article; descriptive research; disease control; eczema; family history; female; gender; health center; health program; human; infant; male; maternal exposure; medical history; passive smoking; pediatrics; questionnaire; rhinitis; risk assessment; risk factor; tobacco",,,,,,,,,,"Diretrizes da Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisiologia para o Manejo da Asma (2012) J Bras Pneumol., 38, pp. S1-S46; (2015) Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention, , http://ginasthma.org/, (updated).

Substratification of patients and controls still delivers 2 clusters (corrected Fig 1, B), where the patients in each cluster can now be distinguished by levels of IgE, CCL-17, CCL-22 and CCL-5 (Fig E1, corrected Fig 1, C). Hierarchical clustering of serum proteins now resulted in 7 instead of 6 clusters (Fig 1, C; corrected Fig 1, D). Twelve proteins, namely G-CSF, IL-5, IL-13, IL-22, CCL-22, IL-1Ra, CXCL-8, IFN-γ, CCL-3, IL-1ß, CCL-17, and IL-6, now significantly correlate with the SCORAD (Fig 2, A; corrected Fig 1, E). The best fit model to predict the SCORAD now contains 10 instead of 12 serum proteins (Fig 2, B; corrected Fig 1, F) and the quality of the model improved substantially recognizable by the increase of the adjusted R2 from 0.198 to 0.47. Despite the fact that the correlation between original and predicted SCORAD is high (r2 = 0.759; corrected Fig 1, F), the leave-one-out cross validation root mean squared prediction error is nonetheless substantial with 18.9 instead of 22.8. Despite the altered results, the overall conclusion of the article did not change as even with sophisticated computational models and a combination of biomarkers the SCORAD cannot be more precisely predicted as with an error of 19 SCORAD points. © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",,"Erratum; error; erratum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mosby Inc.",,,,,00916749,,JACIB,"28270362","English","J.

Amongst HCWs, nurses are at highest risk, with an estimated point prevalence of HD ranging between 12 and 30%. The burden of disease is high with chronicity, sick leave, risk of unemployment and impaired quality of life. Despite evidence from the medical literature on the risk factors and the importance of skin care in the prevention of HD, in practice, compliance to skin care protocols are below 30%. New preventive strategies are obviously needed. Methods/design: This is a cluster randomized controlled trial, focusing on nurses performing wet work. In total, 20 wards are recruited to include 504 participating nurses in the study at baseline. The wards will be randomized to an intervention or a control group and followed up for 18 months. The intervention consists of the facilitation of creams being available at the wards combined with the continuous electronic monitoring of their consumption with regular feedback on skin care performance in teams of HCWs. Both the intervention and the control group receive basic education on skin protection (as 'care as usual'). Every 6 months, participants of both groups will fill in the questionnaires regarding exposure to wet work and skin protective behavior. Furthermore, skin condition will be assessed and samples of the stratum corneum collected. The effect of the intervention will be measured by comparing the change in Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI score) from baseline to 12 months. The Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF) levels, measured in the stratum corneum as an early biomarker of skin barrier damage, and the total consumption of creams per ward will be assessed as a secondary outcome. Discussion: This trial will assess the clinical effectiveness of an intervention program to prevent hand dermatitis among health care workers Trial registration: Netherlands Trial Register (NTR), identification number NTR5564.

In this study, we investigated the association of nutritional status and habitual dietary intake with skin conditions in community-dwelling older people. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Three community settings in Japan from autumn to winter. Participants: Older people aged ≥65 years without care-need certification (n=118). Measurements: Malnutrition and obesity were evaluated to assess the nutritional status. Nutrient and food group intakes per 1000 kcal were evaluated using a brief self-administered diet history questionnaire. Dietary patterns based on food groups were evaluated by principal component analysis. Skin condition parameters, including stratum corneum hydration, appearance of xerosis (specific symptom sum score [SRRC score]), and dermal intensity by high-frequency ultrasonography, were measured on a lower leg. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed with adjustment for confounders. Results: The mean (standard deviation) age was 74.1 (4.8) years, and 83.1% of participants were female. A higher intake of plant fat (p=0.018) was associated with a lower SRRC score. Higher intakes of α-tocopherol (p=0.050) and vitamin C (p=0.017) were associated with increased dermal intensity. A body mass index ≥25 (p=0.016) was associated with decreased dermal intensity. A dietary pattern characterized by higher vegetable and fruit intake was associated with a better skin condition. Conclusion: Plant fat, antioxidant vitamins, and a dietary pattern characterized by vegetables and fruits showed positive and obesity showed negative associations for frail skin in community-dwelling older people. © 2017, Serdi and Springer-Verlag France.","Aging; dermis; frailty; nutritional assessment; vitamin","alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; ascorbic acid; monounsaturated fatty acid; aged; Article; autumn; body mass; community; cross-sectional study; cutaneous parameters; dietary intake; echography; eczema; fat intake; female; food intake; frail elderly; frailty; fruit; human; Japan; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; nutritional assessment; nutritional status; obesity; observational study; priority journal; skin disease; stratum corneum; vegetable; winter; xerosis; diet; independent living; malnutrition; obesity; pathology; principal component analysis; questionnaire; skin; statistical model; Aged; alpha-Tocopherol; Antioxidants; Ascorbic Acid; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated; Female; Fruit; Humans; Independent Living; Japan; Linear Models; Male; Malnutrition; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Principal Component Analysis; Skin; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vegetables",,"alpha tocopherol, 1406-18-4, 1406-70-8, 52225-20-4, 58-95-7, 59-02-9; ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; alpha-Tocopherol; Antioxidants; Ascorbic Acid; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated",,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 15K20927",,,,,"Kohl, E., Steinbauer, J., Landthaler, M., Szeimies, R.M., Skin ageing (2011) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 25 (8), pp. 873-884. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXpsV2hs7s%3D, PID: 21261751; Chang, A.L., Wong, J.W., Endo, J.O., Norman, R.A., Geriatric dermatology review: Major changes in skin function in older patients and their contribution to common clinical challenges (2013) J Am Med Dir Assoc, 14 (10), pp. 724-730. , PID: 23664020; Farage, M.A., Miller, K.W., Elsner, P., Maibach, H.I., Intrinsic and extrinsic factors in skin ageing: a review (2008) Int J Cosmet Sci, (2), pp. 87-95. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD1c3hvFCksw%3D%3D; Kaya, G., Saurat, J.H., Dermatoporosis: a chronic cutaneous insufficiency/fragility syndrome.

Our objective was to determine molecular phenotypes of asthma by analysing sputum cell transcriptomics from 104 moderateto- severe asthmatic subjects and 16 nonasthmatic subjects. After filtering on the differentially expressed genes between eosinophil-And noneosinophil-Associated sputum inflammation, we used unbiased hierarchical clustering on 508 differentially expressed genes and gene set variation analysis of specific gene sets. We defined three transcriptome-Associated clusters (TACs): TAC1 (characterised by immune receptors IL33R, CCR3 and TSLPR), TAC2 (characterised by interferon-, tumour necrosis factor-α-And inflammasome-Associated genes) and TAC3 (characterised by genes of metabolic pathways, ubiquitination and mitochondrial function). TAC1 showed the highest enrichment of gene signatures for interleukin-13/ T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) and innate lymphoid cell type 2. TAC1 had the highest sputum eosinophilia and exhaled nitric oxide fraction, and was restricted to severe asthma with oral corticosteroid dependency, frequent exacerbations and severe airflow obstruction. TAC2 showed the highest sputum neutrophilia, serum C-reactive protein levels and prevalence of eczema. TAC3 had normal to moderately high sputum eosinophils and better preserved forced expiratory volume in 1 s. Gene-protein coexpression networks from TAC1 and TAC2 extended this molecular classification. We defined one Th2-high eosinophilic phenotype TAC1, and two non-Th2 phenotypes TAC2 and TAC3, characterised by inflammasome-Associated and metabolic/mitochondrial pathways, respectively. © ERS 2017.",,"C reactive protein;

Usually both etiological and outcome factors of asthma have been used simultaneously for subtyping thus making the interpretation of the results difficult. Identification of subtypes of asthma based on questionnaire data only will be useful for both treatment of asthma and for research. Our objective was to identify asthma subtypes that capture both asthma control and severity based on easily accessible variables. Methods: We applied latent class analysis for the 1995 adult asthmatics, 692 men and 1303 women, of the Northern Finnish Asthma Study (NoFAS). The classifying variables included use of asthma medication within the last 12months, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire score, and asthma-related healthcare use within the last 12months. Covariates adjusted for included COPD, allergic rhinitis/allergic eczema, BMI, age and sex. All information was based on self-administered questionnaires. Results: We identified four subtypes for women: Controlled, mild asthma (41% of participants); Partly controlled, moderate asthma (24%); Uncontrolled asthma, unknown severity (26%), and Uncontrolled, severe asthma (9%). For men we identified three subtypes: Controlled, mild asthma (31%); Poorly controlled asthma, unknown severity (53%); and Partly controlled, severe asthma (17%). For almost 96% of the subjects this subtyping was accurate. The covariates fitted in the model were based on clinical judgment and were good predictors of class membership. Conclusions: Our results show that it is possible to form meaningful and accurate asthma subtypes based on questionnaire data, and that separate classification should be applied for men and women. © 2017 The Author(s).","Asthma;

The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship of polysensitization with allergic multimorbidities and the severity of allergic diseases. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of 3,368 Korean children aged 6-7 years-old. We defined IgE-mediated allergic diseases based on structured questionnaires, and classified the sensitivity to 18 aeroallergens by logistic regression and the Ward hierarchical clustering method. The relationship of polysensitization (positive IgE responses against 2 or more aeroallergens classes) with allergic multimorbidities (coexistence of 2 or more of the following allergic diseases: asthma, rhinitis, eczema, and conjunctivitis) and severity of allergic diseases was determined by ordinal logistic regression analysis. Results: The rate of polysensitization was 13.6% (n = 458, 95% CI 12.4-14.8) and that of allergic multimorbidity was 23.5% (n = 790, 95% CI 22.0-24.9). Children sensitized to more aeroallergens tended to have more allergic diseases (rho = 0.248, p < 0.001), although the agreement between polysensitization and multimorbidity was poor (kappa = 0.11, p < 0.001). The number allergen classes to which a child was sensitized increased the risk of wheezing attacks (1 allergen: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.22, 4 or more allergens: aOR 9.39), absence from school (1 allergen: aOR 1.96, 3 allergens: aOR 2.08), and severity of nasal symptoms (1 allergen: aOR 1.61, 4 or more allergens: aOR 4.38). Conclusion: Polysensitization was weakly related to multimorbidity. However, the number of allergens to which a child is sensitized is related to the severity of IgE-mediated symptoms. © 2017 S.

However, the microbial signature underlying the pathogenesis of allergies remains unclear. We aim to gain insight into the development of the intestinal microbiota of healthy infants and infants who develop allergy in early life, and identify potential microbiota biomarkers of later allergic disease. Using a case-control design in a Chinese sub-cohort of a Singaporean birth cohort (GUSTO), we utilised 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess intestinal microbial composition and diversity of 21 allergic and 18 healthy infants at 3 weeks, 3 months and 6 months of age, and correlated the microbiota with allergy at ages 18 and 36 months. Pronounced differences in intestinal microbiota composition between allergic and healthy infants were observed at 3 months of age. The intestine of healthy infants was colonised with higher abundance of commensal Bifidobacterium. Conversely, Klebsiella, an opportunistic pathogen, was significantly enriched in the allergic infants. Interestingly, infants with a high Klebsiella/Bifidobacterium (K/B) ratio (above the population median K/B ratio) at age 3 months had an odds ratio of developing allergy by 3 years of age of 9.00 (95% confidence interval 1.46-55.50) compared to those with low K/B ratio. This study demonstrated a relationship between the ratio of genera Klebsiella and Bifidobacterium during early infancy and development of paediatric allergy in childhood. Our study postulates that an elevated K/B ratio in early infancy could be a potential indicator of an increased risk of allergy development. This line of research might enable future intervention strategies in early life to prevent or treat allergy. Our study provides new insights into microbial signatures associated with childhood allergy, in particular, suggests that an elevated K/B ratio could be a potential early-life microbiota biomarker of allergic disease. © 2017 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","16S rRNA; Atopic dermatitis; Bifidobacterium spp; Eczema; Enterobacteriaceae","antibiotic agent; RNA 16S; bacterial DNA; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; 16S rRNA gene; allergy; Article; bacterial colonization; Bifidobacterium; case control study; child; childbirth; childhood disease; Chinese; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; developmental stage; disease association; disease course; female; gene sequence; high risk population; human; infancy; infant; intestine flora; Klebsiella; male; microbial diversity; nonhuman; population abundance; Singaporean; species composition; bacterial load; Bifidobacterium; biota; chemistry; cluster analysis; complication; DNA sequence; dysbiosis; follow up; genetics; hypersensitivity; isolation and purification; Klebsiella; newborn; phylogeny; preschool child; Singapore; Bacterial Load; Bifidobacterium; Biota; Case-Control Studies; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Dysbiosis; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Klebsiella; Male; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Singapore",,"DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",,,"289346, 613977

A scoring system of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome severity (0.5-5) distinguishes two phenotypes: X-linked thrombocytopenia and classic Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Hematopoietic cell transplantation is curative for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome; however, the use of unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation has seldom been described. We analyzed umbilical cord blood transplantation outcomes for 90 patients. The median age at umbilical cord blood transplantation was 1.5 years. Patients were classified according to clinical scores [2 (23%), 3 (30%), 4 (23%) and 5 (19%)]. Most patients underwent HLA-mismatched umbilical cord blood transplantation and myeloablative conditioning with antithymocyte globulin. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 60 was 89% and that of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease at day 100 was 38%. The use of methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis delayed engraftment (P=0.02), but decreased acute graft-versushost disease (P=0.03). At 5 years, overall survival and event-free survival rates were 75% and 70%, respectively. The estimated 5-year event-free survival rates were 83%, 73% and 55% for patients with a clinical score of 2, 4-5 and 3, respectively. In multivariate analysis, age <2 years at the time of the umbilical cord blood transplant and a clinical phenotype of X-linked thrombocytopenia were associated with improved event-free survival. Overall survival tended to be better in patients transplanted after 2007 (P=0.09). In conclusion, umbilical cord blood transplantation is a good alternative option for young children with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome lacking an HLA identical stem cell donor. © 2017 Ferrata Storti Foundation.",,"busulfan; cyclophosphamide; methotrexate; thymocyte antibody; acute graft versus host disease; Article; autoimmunity; bleeding; child; chimera; cord blood stem cell transplantation; disease severity assessment; eczema; engraftment; Epstein Barr virus infection; event free survival; female; follow up; graft failure; human; immunopathology; infant; lymphoproliferative disease; major clinical study; male; myeloablative conditioning; neutrophil count; newborn; overall survival; questionnaire; retrospective study; risk assessment; severe congenital neutropenia; splenectomy; thrombocytopenia; treatment outcome; Wiskott Aldrich syndrome; cord blood stem cell transplantation; graft versus host reaction; mortality; preschool child; procedures; risk assessment; standards; unrelated donors; Wiskott Aldrich syndrome; Child; Child, Preschool; Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation; Female; Graft vs Host Disease; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Risk Assessment; Treatment Outcome; Unrelated Donors; Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome",,"busulfan, 55-98-1; cyclophosphamide, 50-18-0; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5",,,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2013/02162-8

Relations between early sensitization and allergic morbidity need to be clarified. Methods: This study dealt with children involved in the Pollution and Asthma Risk: an Infant Study (PARIS), a population-based prospective birth cohort. Allergic sensitization to twelve food and four inhalant allergens was assessed at 18 months and defined by a specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) level ≥0.35 kUA/l. Health data were collected by standardized questionnaires at 2 and 6 years. Early allergic profiles were identified by an unsupervised cluster analysis based on health data at 2 years and IgE measurements. Profiles were compared with regard to allergic morbidity and multimorbidity at 6 years. Results: Sensitization to any allergen concerned 13.6% of infants. By cluster analysis, 1525 infants were grouped into three profiles: 89.2% not or rarely sensitized (only 3.7% of sensitized), 9.2% mainly sensitized to one or few allergens (45.2% of monosensitized and 45.9% of paucisensitized) and 1.6% all polysensitized. The prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma, rhinitis, eczema, food allergy and multimorbidity at 2 years increased from profile one to profile three (p-trend &lt;0.001). At 6 years, symptoms of current asthma, rhinitis, eczema and multimorbidity were significantly more frequent in the last two profiles. Conclusions: This study highlights, as early as 18 months of age, three profiles of increasing severity with regard to allergic sensitization and diseases. These profiles also differ in terms of allergic morbidity at 6 years. Early sensitization can predict allergic multimorbidity in childhood, and in the case of early polysensitization, multimorbidity is more frequent as soon as infancy. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Design Nationally representative prospective cohort study. Setting Children born in the UK between 2000 and 2002. Participants 11â €..399 11-year-old singleton children for whom data on all 6 health conditions and sociodemographic information were available (complete cases). Main outcome measures Prevalence, co-occurrence and clustering of 6 common health conditions: wheeze; eczema; long-standing illness (excluding wheeze and eczema); injury; socioemotional difficulties (measured using Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) and unfavourable weight (thin/overweight/obese vs normal). Results 42.4% of children had 2 or more adverse health conditions (co-occurrence). Co-occurrence was more common in boys and children from lower income households. Latent class analysis identified 6 classes: â € normative' (57.4%): â € atopic burdened' (14.0%); â € socioemotional burdened' (11.0%); â € unfavourable weight/injury' (7.7%); â € eczema/injury' (6.0%) and â € eczema/unfavourable weight' (3.9%). As with co-occurrence, class membership differed by sociodemographic factors: boys, children of mothers with lower educational attainment and children from lower income households were more likely to be in the â € socioemotional burdened' class. Children of mothers with higher educational attainment were more likely to be in the â € normative' and â € eczema/unfavourable weight' classes. Conclusions Co-occurrence of adverse health conditions at age 11 is common and is associated with adverse socioeconomic circumstances. Holistic, child focused care, particularly in boys and those in lower income groups, may help to prevent and reduce co-occurrence in later childhood and adolescence. © 2016 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Methods: Multiple electronic databases were searched from inception to December 2014 in order to identify primary studies and meta-analyses. Population: Patients with moderate to severe active CD treated with infliximab (IFX) (Remicade®,Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) or adalimumab (ADA) (Humira®, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA). Intervention: Monitoring of serum anti-TNF-α (IFX or ADA) and/or of anti-drug antibody levels using test assays with a test-treatment algorithm. Comparator: Standard care. Outcomes: Any patient-related outcome, test agreement and cost-effectiveness estimates. The quality assessments used recognised checklists (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2, Cochrane, Philips and Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards). Evidence was synthesised using narrative review and meta-analysis. A Markov model was built in TreeAge Pro 2013 (TreeA Software, Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA). The model had a 4-week cycle and a 10-year time horizon, adopted a NHS and Personal Social Services perspective and used a linked evidence approach. Costs were adjusted to 2013/14 prices and discounted at 3.5%. Results: We included 68 out of 2434 and 4 out of 2466 studies for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness reviews, respectively. Twenty-three studies comparing test methods were identified. Evidence on test concordance was sparse and contradictory, offering scant data for a linked evidence approach. Three studies [two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one retrospective observational study] investigated outcomes following implementation of a test algorithm. None used the specified commercial ELISA immunoassay test kits. Neither of the two RCTs demonstrated clinical benefit of a test-treatment regimen. A meta-analysis of 31 studies to estimate test accuracy for predicting clinical status indicated that 20-30% of test results are likely to be inaccurate. The four cost-effectiveness studies suggested that testing results in small cost reductions. In the economic analysis the base-case analysis showed that standard practice (no testing/therapeutic monitoring with the intervention tests) was more costly and more effective than testing for IFX. Sensitivity and scenario analyses gave similar results. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 92% likelihood that the ‘no-testing’ strategy was cost-effective at a willingness to pay of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Strengths and limitations: Rigorous systematic reviews were undertaken; however, the underlying evidence base was poor or lacking. There was uncertainty about a linked evidence approach and a lack of gold standard for assay comparison. The only comparative evidence available for economic evaluation was for assays other than the intervention assays. Conclusions: Our finding that testing is not cost-effective for IFX should be viewed cautiously in view of the limited evidence. Clinicians should be mindful of variation in performance of different assays and of the absence of standardised approaches to patient assessment and treatment algorithms. © Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.",,"adalimumab; drug antibody; infliximab; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; algorithm; allergic reaction; arthralgia; Article; assay; bacterial infection; chill; clinical effectiveness; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; Crohn disease; demyelination; disease exacerbation; drug blood level; drug dose escalation; drug dose increase; drug dose intensification; drug monitoring; drug response; drug withdrawal; dysphagia; dyspnea; economic model; eczema; ELISA kit; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; face edema; false negative result; false positive result; fever; foot edema; hand edema; health care cost; health care utilization; hepatitis; homogenous mobility shift assay; human; infusion related reaction; injection site contusion; injection site pain; injection site pruritus; injection site swelling; intermethod comparison; leukemia; lupus like syndrome; lupus vulgaris; lymphoma; measurement accuracy; minimum plasma concentration; myalgia; pneumonia; predictive value; psoriasis; quality adjusted life year; radioimmunoassay; randomized controlled trial (topic); rash; recommended drug dose; relapse; remission; sensitivity analysis; sensitivity and specificity; skin cancer; skin defect; skin manifestation; skin ulcer; systematic review; thorax pain; tuberculosis; urticaria; virus infection",,"adalimumab, 331731-18-1; infliximab, 170277-31-3","humira, AbbVie, United States; remicade, Merck Sharp and Dohme, United StatesLISA-TRACKER; Prometheus, Prometheus, United States; Promonitor","AbbVie, United States; Merck Sharp and Dohme, United StatesImmundiagnostik, Germany; Prometheus, United States","Health Technology Assessment Programme, HTA","The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.",,,,"Merlin, T., Lehman, S., Hiller, J., Ryan, P., The ‘linked evidence approach’ to assess medical tests: A critical analysis (2013) Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 29, pp. 343-350. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266462313000287; (2012) Crohn’s Disease: Management in Adults, Children and Young People, , www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg152, Clinical guideline 152.

We hypothesize that immune mediators in breast milk could explain such association either through a direct effect or as a surrogate marker of maternal immune constitution. Objective: To investigate the possible association between cytokine and chemokine levels in breast milk and development of eczema and recurrent wheeze during early childhood. Methods: Levels of 19 pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines were measured in 223 breast milk samples from mothers in the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood2000 (COPSAC) high-risk birth cohort. Eczema and recurrent wheeze at the age of 0–3 years were prospectively diagnosed by COPSAC physicians adherent to predefined validated algorithms. Association analyses were performed by Cox regression adjusting for potential confounding factors and by multivariable principal component analysis. Results: Increased IL-1β in breast milk (≥ 0.7 pg/mL) was associated with more than a halved risk of eczema before age three (aHR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.24–0.68; P &lt; 0.001), which remained significant after false discovery rate adjustment (P = 0.008). The principal component analysis confirmed that a mediator pattern dominated by high levels of IL-1β, IL-17A, and CCL17 and low levels of CXCL1 and TSLP in breast milk protected against eczema (aHR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.68–0.98; P = 0.03). No associations were observed for recurrent wheeze. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Elevated breast milk IL-1β level was associated with decreased risk of early childhood eczema suggesting either a direct protective effect of IL-1β or IL-1b acting as a proxy for a healthy maternal immune system protecting high-risk offspring from eczema. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","breastfeeding;

We aimed to identify severe bronchiolitis profiles using a clustering approach. Methods We analysed data from two prospective, multicentre cohorts of children younger than 2 years hospitalised with bronchiolitis, one in the USA (2007' 2010 winter seasons, n=2207) and one in Finland (2008'2010 winter seasons, n=408). Severe bronchiolitis profiles were determined by latent class analysis, classifying children based on clinical factors and viral aetiology. Results In the US study, four profiles were identified. Profile A (12%) was characterised by history of wheezing and eczema, wheezing at the emergency department (ED) presentation and rhinovirus infection. Profile B (36%) included children with wheezing at the ED presentation, but, in contrast to profile A, most did not have history of wheezing or eczema; this profile had the largest probability of respiratory syncytial virus infection. Profile C (34%) was the most severely ill group, with longer hospital stay and moderate-to-severe retractions. Profile D (17%) had the least severe illness, including non-wheezing children with shorter length of stay. Two of these profiles (A and D) were replicated in the Finnish cohort; a third group ('BC') included Finnish children with characteristics of profiles B and/or C in the US population. Conclusions Several distinct clinical profiles (phenotypes) were identified by a clustering approach in two multicentre studies of children hospitalised for bronchiolitis. The observed heterogeneity has important implications for future research on the aetiology, management and long-term outcomes of bronchiolitis, such as future risk of childhood asthma.",,"antibiotic agent; bronchodilating agent; corticosteroid; Article; artificial ventilation; asthma; bronchiolitis; cohort analysis; disease association; disease severity; eczema; emergency ward; female; fever; Finland; hospital admission; hospitalized child; human; infant; length of stay; major clinical study; male; medical history; multicenter study; phenotype; priority journal; prospective study; respiratory syncytial virus infection; Rhinovirus infection; risk factor; seasonal variation; United States; virus etiology; wheezing; bronchiolitis; Bronchiolitis, Viral; clinical trial; cluster analysis; complication; eczema; hospital; preschool child; Respiratory Sounds; respiratory syncytial virus infection; virology; Bronchiolitis; Bronchiolitis, Viral; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Cohort Studies; Eczema; Female; Finland; Hospitals, Pediatric; Humans; Infant; Male; Prospective Studies; Respiratory Sounds; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; United States",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

Methods: We analyzed data from the 2007–2008 National Survey of Children's Health including a representative sample of 91,642 children age 0–17 years and the 2006–2007 Environmental Protection Agency measurements of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrate (NO3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), organic carbon (OC), sulfate (SO3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM-2.5) and &lt;10 μm (PM-10), and tropospheric ozone levels, and the National Climate Data Center measurements of relative humidity (%), issued UV index, outdoor air temperature, and precipitation levels. Results: In multivariate survey logistic regression models controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, household income, US birthplace, and history of moving to a new location, eczema was associated with higher mean annual NO2 (p = 0.008), SO2 (p = 0.006), SO3 (p = 0.0002), arsenic (p = 0.0007), nickel (p = 0.0002), lead (p = 0.03), vanadium (p &lt; 0.0001), and zinc (p = 0.003), but lower NO3 (p = 0.002), OC (p = 0.03), PM-2.5 (p = 0.006), cadmium (p &lt; 0.0001), copper (p = 0.004), and potassium (p &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, moderate–severe eczema was associated with higher NO3 (p = 0.03), OC (p = 0.008) and PM-2.5 (p = 0.01), copper (p = 0.04), lead (p = 0.008), and zinc (p = 0.01), but lower CO (p = 0.03). Principal component analysis was used and identified 4 combinations of pollutants and climate factors occurring in the USA, of which 1 was associated with higher prevalence and two were associated with lower prevalences of eczema (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Pollutants in conjunction with climate factors may differentially impact eczema prevalence and severity, some with apparent harmful effects. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

While a range of skin care strategies and policy directives have been developed in recent years to minimise the risk, their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness remain unclear. Evidence now suggests that psychological theory can facilitate behaviour change with respect to improved hand care practices. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that a behavioural change intervention to improve hand care, based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and implementation intentions, coupled with provision of hand moisturisers, can produce a clinically useful reduction in the occurrence of hand dermatitis, when compared to standard care, among nurses working in the UK National Health Service (NHS) who are particularly at risk. Secondary aims will be to assess impacts on participants' beliefs and behaviour regarding hand care. In addition, we will assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in comparison with normal care. Methods/Design: We will conduct a cluster randomised controlled trial at 35 NHS hospital trusts/health boards/universities, focussing on student nurses with a previous history of atopic disease or hand eczema and on nurses in intensive care units. Nurses at 'intervention-light' sites will be managed according to what would currently be regarded as best practice, with provision of an advice leaflet about optimal hand care to prevent hand dermatitis and encouragement to contact their occupational health (OH) department early if hand dermatitis occurs. Nurses at 'intervention-plus' sites will additionally receive a behavioural change programme (BCP) with on-going active reinforcement of its messages, and enhanced provision of moisturising cream. The impact of the interventions will be compared using information collected by questionnaires and through standardised photographs of the hands and wrists, collected at baseline and after 12 months follow-up. In addition, we will assemble relevant economic data for an analysis of costs and benefits, and collect information from various sources to evaluate processes. Statistical analysis will be by multi-level regression modelling to allow for clustering by site, and will compare the prevalence of outcome measures at follow-up after adjustment for values at baseline. The principal outcome measure will be the prevalence of visible hand dermatitis as assessed by the study dermatologists. In addition, several secondary outcome measures will be assessed. Discussion: This trial will assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of an intervention to prevent hand dermatitis in nurses in the United Kigdom.

Material/Method: There were 309 patients enrolled and they were further divided into the type I allergic disease group, the newly diagnosed breast cancer with type I allergic disease group, the re-visit breast cancer with type I allergic disease group, and the re-visit breast cancer without type I allergic disease group, as well as a healthy control group. Serum total IgE level was detected by immunoassay. Results: The IgE value in the healthy population with type I allergic diseases (89.3±51.4 IU/ml) was significantly higher than in those without type I allergic diseases (45.6±65.1 IU/ml). There was no significant difference between IgE values in the re-visit breast cancer patients with type I allergic disease (25.1±65.1 IU/ml) and those without type I allergic disease (23.0±45.9 IU/ml). The area under the ROC curve was 0.618±0.04, sensitivity was 78%, specificity was 47.1%, Youden index was 0.251, and IgE threshold was 32.6 IU/ml. Conclusions: The patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer were susceptible to type I allergic disease at about the same levels as in the healthy population. There was no correlation between breast cancer and type I allergic disease. © Med Sci Monit, 2016.","Breast; Immunization; Tumor markers, biological","immunoglobulin E; tumor marker; immunoglobulin E; adult; allergic asthma; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; controlled study; eczema; female; follow up; hormonal therapy; human; immunoassay; major clinical study; molecularly targeted therapy; prevalence; questionnaire; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; telediagnosis; turbidimetry; urticaria; adolescent; age distribution; aged; blood; Breast Neoplasms; case control study; child; factor analysis; hypersensitivity; infant; middle aged; newborn; preschool child; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunoglobulin E; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Immunoglobulin E",,,,,,,,"Fan, L., Strasser-Weippl, K., Li, J.J., Breast cancer in China (2014) Lancet Oncol, 15 (7), pp. e279-e289; Singer, J., Jensen-Jarolim, E., IgE-based immunotherapy of cancer: Challenges and chances (2014) Allergy, 69 (2), pp. 137-149; Singer, J., Jensen-Jarolim, E., IgE-based immunotherapy of cancer - A comparative oncology approach (2014) J Carcinog Mutagen, 5 (3); Lopes, L.V., Miguel, F., Freitas, H., Stage at presentation of breast cancer in Luanda, Angola - A retrospective study (2015) BMC Health Serv Res, 5 (1), p. 471; Zhou, M.H., Yang, Q.M., Association of asthma with the risk of acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2015) Mol Clin Oncol, 3 (4), pp. 859-864; Shuz, L., Morgan, G., Bohler, E., Atopic disease and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2003) Int J Cancer, 105 (2), pp. 255-260; Petridou, E.T., Chavelas, C., Dikalioti, S.K., Breast cancer risk in relation to most prevalent IgE specific antibodies: A case control study in Greece (2007) Anticancer Res, 27 (3), pp. 1709-1713; Hedderson, M.M., Malone, K.E., Daling, J.R., Allergy and risk of breast cancer among young women (United States) (2003) Cancer Causes Control, 14 (7), pp. 619-626; Wang, H., Rothenbacher, D., Löw, M., Atopic diseases, immunoglobulin E and risk of cancer of the prostate, breast, lung and colorectum (2006) Int J Cancer, 119 (3), pp. 695-701; Vojtechova, P., Martin, R.M., The association of atopic diseases with breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers: A meta-analysis (2009) Cancer Causes Control, 20 (7), pp. 1091-1105; Rui, F., Guangfeng, W., Cheng, S., Clinical and pathological study of 422 cases of breast cancer in Nanyang area (2008) Modern Oncology Medicine, 16 (9), pp. 1522-1524; Jianghui, H., Mengjuan, T., Wenjian, Z., Analysis of age and pathology in 2086 patients with breast cancer (2008) Journal of XiangNan University (Medical Edition), 10 (1), pp. 36-37; Xiangxiang, T., Yifeng, R., The clinical and pathological analysis of 430 cases of breast cancer in the south of Anhui Province (2008) Journal of Tongling Career Technical College, 7 (1), pp. 46-47; Xia, X.C., Chen, Q., Liu, K., Mycoepoxydiene inhibits antigen stimulated activation of mast cells and suppresses IgE-mediated anaphylaxis in mice (2013) Int Immunopharmacol, 17 (2), pp. 336-341; Vrtala, S., Fischer, S., Grote, M., Molecular, immunological, and structural characterization of Phlp6, a major allergen and Pparticle-associated protein from Timothy grass (Phleum pratense) pollen (1999) J Immunol, 163 (10), pp. 5489-5496; Wen, Z., Xiaoli, M., Mei, J., Analysis on the immune function indicators before and after chemotherapy of children neuroblastoma (2014) Chinese Journal of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 19 (2), pp. 82-84; Yanhua, Z., Correct understanding of adverse drug reactions (2014) Pharmacy and Clinic, 9 (8), pp. 178-179","Guo, G.; Department of Breast Surgery, China; email: guogangnmg@sina.com",,,"International Scientific Literature Inc.",,,,,12341010,,MSMOF,"26901362","English","Med.

However, little is known about the complete microbiota profile of adult individuals suffering from asthma. We determined the fecal microbiota in 21 adult patients suffering allergic asthma (age 39.43 ± 10.98 years old) and compare it with the fecal microbiota of 22 healthy controls (age 39.29 ± 9.21 years old) using culture independent techniques. An Ion-Torrent 16S rRNA gene-based amplification and sequencing protocol was used to determine the fecal microbiota profile of the individuals. Sequence microbiota analysis showed that the microbial alpha-diversity was not significantly different between healthy and allergic individuals and no clear clustering of the samples was obtained using an unsupervised principal component analysis. However, the analysis of specific bacterial groups allowed us to detect significantly lower levels of bifidobacteria in patients with long-term asthma. Also, in allergic individuals the Bifidobacterium adolescentis species prevailed within the bifidobacterial population. The reduction in the levels on bifidobacteria in patients with long-term asthma suggests a new target in allergy research and opens possibilities for the therapeutic modulation of the gut microbiota in this group of patients. © 2016 Hevia et al.

This study aimed to give specific estimates for the heritability of childhood asthma and other allergic diseases, to attempt to replicate findings from genomewide association studies (GWAS) for childhood asthma and to test the same variants against other allergic diseases. Methods In a cohort of 25 306 Swedish twins aged 9 or 12 years, data on asthma were available from parental interviews and population-based registers. The interviews also inquired about wheeze, hay fever, eczema, and food allergy. Through structural equation modeling, the heritability of all phenotypes was calculated. A subset of 10 075 twins was genotyped for 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from previous GWAS; these were first tested for association with asthma and significant findings also against the other allergic diseases. Results The heritability of any childhood asthma was 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.85). For the other allergic diseases, the range was approximately 0.60-0.80. Associations for six SNPs with asthma were replicated, including rs2305480 in the GSDMB gene (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.86, P = 1.5∗10-8; other significant associations all below P = 3.5∗10-4). Of these, only rs3771180 in IL1RL1 was associated with any other allergic disease (for hay fever, OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53-0.77, P = 2.5∗10-6). Conclusion Asthma and allergic diseases of childhood are highly heritable, and these high-risk genetic variants associated specifically with childhood asthma, except for one SNP shared with hay fever. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Neural WASP (N-WASP) is a broadly expressed homolog of WASP, and regulates B-cell signaling bymodulating B-cell receptor (BCR) clustering and internalization.Wehave generated a double conditional mouse lacking both WASP and N-WASP selectively in B lymphocytes (B/DcKO). Compared with B/WcKO mice, B/DcKO mice showed defective B-lymphocyte proliferation and impaired antibody responses to T-celldependent antigens, associated with decreased autoantibody production and lack of autoimmune kidney disease. These results demonstrate that N-WASP expression in B lymphocytes is required for the development of autoimmunity of WAS and may represent a novel therapeutic target in WAS. ©2016 by The American Society of Hematology.",,"lymphocyte antigen receptor; neural Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein; Wasl protein, mouse; animal; autoimmunity; B lymphocyte; cell differentiation; gene deletion; genetics; immunology; knockout mouse; metabolism; mouse; pathology; physiology; signal transduction; Wiskott Aldrich syndrome; Animals; Autoimmunity; B-Lymphocytes; Cell Differentiation; Gene Deletion; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell; Signal Transduction; Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome; Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein, Neuronal",,"Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell; Wasl protein, mouse; Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein, Neuronal",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: CHUV-UNIL CGRB 29583

Self-efficacy is a key factor influencing effective chronic disease management, yet there are no published scales to measure parental self-efficacy in managing childhood eczema. The Parental Self-Efficacy with Eczema Care Index (PASECI) was designed to measure parental self-efficacy in managing childhood eczema as a pre- and postintervention tool in the evaluation of a structured Eczema Education Programme (EEP). Objectives To develop and test the validity, reliability and sensitivity of a new outcome measure (PASECI) designed to assess parental self-efficacy in managing their child's eczema to determine pre- vs. postintervention changes in educational intervention evaluation studies. Methods PASECI was developed from the literature, expert consultation and piloting of a 40-item prototype. The final 29-item scale is arranged in four subscales. Parents of children with eczema aged 0-16 years (n = 242) attending the EEP were assessed at 1 week pre-EEP and 4 weeks postintervention. Cronbach's α and factor analyses were undertaken. Results PASECI has face, content and construct validity. It is reliable, with high item internal consistency (α > 0·87 in all domains). Factor analysis revealed four viable domains. It was sensitive to change for postintervention measures using sign tests (P < 0·001). Conclusions PASECI is a useful, valid, reliable and sensitive evaluative outcome measure of self-efficacy in parents managing childhood eczema. © 2015 British Association of Dermatologists.",,"adolescent; Article; assessment of humans; atopic dermatitis; child; childhood disease; construct validity; content validity; controlled study; disease severity; education program; face validity; factorial analysis; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; Parental Self Efficacy with Eczema Care Index; primary medical care; priority journal; program evaluation; quality of life; questionnaire; sensitivity analysis; validation process; Dermatitis, Atopic; infant; newborn; parent; preschool child; psychology; reproducibility; self concept; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Parents; Reproducibility of Results; Self Efficacy; Treatment Outcome",,,,,,,,,,"McHenry, P.M., Williams, H.C., Bingham, E.A., Management of atopic eczema (1995) BMJ, 310, pp. 843-847; Lawson, V., Lewis-Jones, M.S., Finlay, A.Y., The family impact of childhood atopic dermatitis: The Dermatitis Family Impact questionnaire (1998) Br J Dermatol, 138, pp. 107-113; Atopic Eczema in Children: Management of Atopic Eczema in Children from Birth Up to the Age of 12 Years.

Objective We sought to investigate the evolution of IgE responses to allergenic components of timothy grass and dust mite during childhood. Methods In a population-based birth cohort (n = 1184) we measured IgE responses to 15 components from timothy grass and dust mite in children with available samples at 3 time points (ages 5, 8, and 11 years; n = 235). We designed a nested, 2-stage latent class analysis to identify cross-sectional sensitization patterns at each follow-up and their longitudinal trajectories. We then ascertained the association of longitudinal trajectories with asthma, rhinitis, eczema, and lung function in children with component data for at least 2 time points (n = 534). Results Longitudinal latent class analysis revealed 3 grass sensitization trajectories: (1) no/low sensitization; (2) early onset; and (3) late onset. The early-onset trajectory was associated with asthma and diminished lung function, and the late-onset trajectory was associated with rhinitis. Four longitudinal trajectories emerged for mite: (1) no/low sensitization; (2) group 1 allergens; (3) group 2 allergens; and (3) complete mite sensitization. Children in the complete mite sensitization trajectory had the highest odds ratios (ORs) for asthma (OR, 7.15; 95% CI, 3.80-13.44) and were the only group significantly associated with comorbid asthma, rhinitis, and eczema (OR, 5.91; 95% CI, 2.01-17.37). Among children with wheezing, those in the complete mite sensitization trajectory (but not other longitudinal mite trajectories) had significantly higher risk of severe exacerbations (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 1.62-6.67). Conclusions The nature of developmental longitudinal trajectories of IgE responses differed between grass and mite allergen components, with temporal differences (early vs late onset) dominant in grass and diverging patterns of IgE responses (group 1 allergens, group 2 allergens, or both) in mite. Different longitudinal patterns bear different associations with clinical outcomes, which varied by allergen. © 2015 The Authors.","allergens; asthma; childhood; component-resolved diagnostics; dust mite; IgE; latent class analysis; rhinitis; timothy grass; wheeze","grass pollen extract; house dust allergen; immunoglobulin E; allergen; immunoglobulin E; nitric oxide; allergic asthma; allergic rhinitis; Article; child; childhood; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; eczema; female; follow up; human; immune response; longitudinal study; lung function; major clinical study; male; preschool child; priority journal; school child; sensitization; wheezing; animal; blood; forced expiratory volume; hypersensitivity; immunology; infant; metabolism; mite; pathophysiology; Phleum pratense; United Kingdom; vital capacity; Allergens; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunoglobulin E; Infant; Male; Mites; Nitric Oxide; Phleum; United Kingdom; Vital Capacity",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; Allergens; Immunoglobulin E; Nitric Oxide",,,"Medical Research Council, MRC: G0601361, MC_PC_13042, MR/K002449/1, MR/K002449/2, MR/K006665/1",,,,,"Custovic, A., Lazic, N., Simpson, A., Pediatric asthma and development of atopy (2013) Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol, 13, pp. 173-180; Johansson, S.G., Bieber, T., Dahl, R., Friedmann, P.S., Lanier, B.Q., Lockey, R.F., Revised nomenclature for allergy for global use: Report of the Nomenclature Review Committee of the World Allergy Organization, October 2003 (2004) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 113, pp. 832-836; Marinho, S., Simpson, A., Marsden, P., Smith, J.A., Custovic, A., Quantification of atopy, lung function and airway hypersensitivity in adults (2011) Clin Transl Allergy, 1, p. 16; Marinho, S., Simpson, A., Soderstrom, L., Woodcock, A., Ahlstedt, S., Custovic, A., Quantification of atopy and the probability of rhinitis in preschool children: A population-based birth cohort study (2007) Allergy, 62, pp. 1379-1386; Simpson, A., Soderstrom, L., Ahlstedt, S., Murray, C.S., Woodcock, A., Custovic, A., IgE antibody quantification and the probability of wheeze in preschool children (2005) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 116, pp. 744-749; Sly, P.D., Boner, A.L., Bjorksten, B., Bush, A., Custovic, A., Eigenmann, P.A., Early identification of atopy in the prediction of persistent asthma in children (2008) Lancet, 372, pp. 1100-1106; Nicolaou, N., Custovic, A., Molecular diagnosis of peanut and legume allergy (2011) Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol, 11, pp. 222-228; Treudler, R., Simon, J.C., Overview of component resolved diagnostics (2013) Curr Allergy Asthma Rep, 13, pp. 110-117; Valenta, R., Lidholm, J., Niederberger, V., Hayek, B., Kraft, D., Grönlund, H., The recombinant allergen-based concept of component-resolved diagnostics and immunotherapy (CRD and CRIT) (1999) Clin Exp Allergy, 29, pp. 896-904; Melioli, G., Bonifazi, F., Bonini, S., Maggi, E., Mussap, M., Passalacqua, G., The ImmunoCAP ISAC molecular allergology approach in adult multi-sensitized Italian patients with respiratory symptoms (2011) Clin Biochem, 44, pp. 1005-1011; Prosperi, M.C., Belgrave, D., Buchan, I., Simpson, A., Custovic, A., Challenges in interpreting allergen microarrays in relation to clinical symptoms: A machine learning approach (2014) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 25, pp. 71-79; Hatzler, L., Panetta, V., Lau, S., Wagner, P., Bergmann, R.L., Illi, S., Molecular spreading and predictive value of preclinical IgE response to Phleum pratense in children with hay fever (2012) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 130, pp. 894-901e5; Custovic, A., Simpson, B.M., Murray, C.S., Lowe, L., Woodcock, A., The National Asthma Campaign Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study (2002) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 13, pp. 32-37; Belgrave, D.C., Buchan, I., Bishop, C., Lowe, L., Simpson, A., Custovic, A., Trajectories of lung function during childhood (2014) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 189, pp. 1101-1109; Crapo, R.O., Casaburi, R., Coates, A.L., Enright, P.L., Hankinson, J.L., Irvin, C.G., Guidelines for methacholine and exercise challenge testing-1999.

Objective We sought to identify patterns of response to a broad range of allergen components and investigate associations with asthma, eczema, and hay fever. Methods Serum specific IgE levels to 112 allergen components were measured by using a multiplex array (Immuno Solid-phase Allergen Chip) in a population-based birth cohort. Latent variable modeling was used to identify underlying patterns of component-specific IgE responses; these patterns were then related to asthma, eczema, and hay fever. Results Two hundred twenty-one of 461 children had IgE to 1 or more components. Seventy-one of the 112 components were recognized by 3 or more children. By using latent variable modeling, 61 allergen components clustered into 3 component groups (CG1, CG2, and CG3); protein families within each CG were exclusive to that group. CG1 comprised 27 components from 8 plant protein families. CG2 comprised 7 components of mite allergens from 3 protein families. CG3 included 27 components of plant, animal, and fungal origin from 12 protein families. Each CG included components from different biological sources with structural homology and also nonhomologous proteins arising from the same biological source. Sensitization to CG3 was most strongly associated with asthma (odds ratio [OR], 8.20; 95% CI, 3.49-19.24; P &lt;.001) and lower FEV1 (P &lt;.001). Sensitization to CG1 was associated with hay fever (OR, 12.79; 95% CI, 6.84-23.90; P &lt;.001). Sensitization to CG2 was associated with both asthma (OR, 3.60; 95% CI, 2.05-6.29) and hay fever (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.38-4.61). Conclusions Latent variable modeling with a large number of allergen components identified 3 patterns of IgE responses, each including different protein families. In 11-year-old children the pattern of response to components of multiple allergens appeared to be associated with current asthma and hay fever but not eczema. © 2015 The Authors","allergens; asthma; childhood; component-resolved diagnostics; eczema; hay fever; IgE; latent variable modeling; wheeze","allergen; immunoglobulin E; lipocalin; nitric oxide; tropomyosin; allergen; immunoglobulin E; Article; asthma; child; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; eczema; forced expiratory volume; fungus; human; immune response; immunoglobulin blood level; major clinical study; plant; pollen allergy; priority journal; protein family; sensitization; structural homology; symptomatology; wheezing; blood; female; humoral immunity; immunization; immunology; male; population group; prospective study; system analysis; Allergens; Asthma; Child; Cohort Studies; Eczema; Female; Humans; Immunity, Humoral; Immunization; Immunoglobulin E; Male; Population Groups; Prospective Studies; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Systems Analysis",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; tropomyosin, 72067-79-9; Allergens; Immunoglobulin E",,,"AstraZeneca

Our data come from patients who underwent Phadiatop test examinations in the University Hospital of Ostrava, the Department of Work and preventive medicine. As predictive variables for discriminant analysis, personal and family anamnesis, sex and age of the patient were selected and appropriately rated. These data were obtained on the spot assessment of the manifestations of atopy. Both of these anamneses were divided into four categories according to severity ranked by doctors (asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, and others). Evaluation was based on the test results. One of two possible values is involved there: 0 for Phadiatop test result 0 and I, or 1 for values II to VI. Both methods provide very similar results with the success rate 64% for correct classification of patients. Model was tested using a database of 274 clients. Both methods used statistically significant diseases which influence the Phadiatop test results - asthma and allergic rhinitis - in personal anamnesis. © 2015 IEEE.","CHAID algortihm; decission tree; logistic regression; Phadiatop test","Algorithms; Data mining; Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Diseases; Regression analysis; Testing; Allergic rhinitis; CHAID algortihm; decission tree; Logistic regressions; On the spots; Ostrava; Predictive variables; Preventive medicines; Trees (mathematics)",,,,,,,,,,"Hajduková, Z., Vantuchová, Y., Klimková, P., Makhoul, M., Hromádka, R., Atopy in patiens with allergic contact dermatitis (2009) Jurnal of Czech Physicians Occupational Therapy, (2), pp. 69-73. , http://www.prolek/.cz/caSopiS-lekaru-ceskych-clanek?id=5780, In Czech; Hajduková, Z., Pólová, J., Kosek, V., The importance of Atopy Investigation in the Department of Travel Medicine (2005) Allergies: Magazine for Continuous Education in Allergy and Ctimcal Immunology, (2), pp. 106-109. , http://www.tigis.cz/alergie/alergie_2_2005/obsah_f.htm, In Czech; Brock, W.P., Siegel, C., Portnoy, J., Efficacy of a single diagnostic test for sensitization to common inhalant allergens (2001) Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, pp. 196-202. , 86.2; Sigurs, N., Asthma and allergy patterns over 18 years after severe RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of life (2010) Thorax, pp. 1045-1052. , 65.12; Wuthrich, B., Prevalence of atopy and pollinosis in the adult population of Switzerland (SAPALDIA study) (2010) International Archives of Allergy and Immunology, pp. 149-156. , 106.2; Wuthrich, B., IgE levels, atopy markers and hay fever in relation to age, sex and smoking status in a normal adult Swiss population (2009) International Archives of Allergy and Immunology, pp. 396-402. , 111.4; Hosmer, D.W., Lemeshow, S., (2000) Applied Logistic Regression, , NewYork: Wiley -Interscience; Menard, S., (2009) Logisti Regression from Introductorz to Advanced Concepts and Applications, , SAGE Publications Inc; Kuráñová, P., Hajduková, Z., The Use of Logistic and Ordinal Regression for the Prediction of the Phadiatop Test Results (2013) Sborník Konference the Ninth International Conference on Digital Technologies Žihna, pp. 111-115; Nisbet, R., Elder, J.F., Miner, G., (2009) Handbook of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Applications, , Boston.

The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence, clinical manifestations, spectrum of allergens, and related risk factors of FA in preschool children in Guangdong Province, southern China. Methods: A random cluster-sampling method was used to select 24 kindergartens from 12 cities in Guangdong Province. The parents or guardians of the children were requested to complete a questionnaire on general information and data regarding FA diagnosis and symptoms in the children and their first-degree relatives. Thereafter, the Chi-square test, multivariate regression analysis, and Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficient analysis were performed to identify statistically significant differences. Results: Analysis of 2540 valid questionnaires revealed an FA prevalence rate of 4%. Adverse food reactions were due to the consumption of shrimp (4.4%), crab (3.2%), mango (2.3%), cow’s milk and dairy products (1.9%), and eggs (1.4%). Logistic regression analysis indicated that a history of FA and a history of allergic rhinitis in the first-degree relatives were the major factors leading to FA in children. Conclusions: The incidence of FA in children in Guangdong Province is higher than that commonly believed. An individual’s genetic background is an important risk factor for FA. Hence, mitigation of the impact of lifestyle and environmental factors should be carefully considered to reduce the incidence of childhood FA. © 2015, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","allergic rhinitis; eczema; epidemiology; food allergy; questionnaire","allergen; allergen; allergic conjunctivitis; allergic rhinitis; anaphylactoid purpura; Article; asthma; beef; body height; body weight; cacao; cashew nut; child; childhood disease; China; controlled study; crab; dairy product; drug hypersensitivity; eczema; egg; female; first degree relative; fish; food allergy; hazelnut; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; mango; milk; nut; peanut; potato; prevalence; provocation test; questionnaire; risk factor; shrimp; skin allergy; soybean; wheat; age distribution; clinical trial; cluster analysis; comparative study; cross-sectional study; Food Hypersensitivity; immunology; multicenter study; preschool child; questionnaire; severity of illness index; sex ratio; statistical model; Age Distribution; Allergens; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Cluster Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Distribution; Surveys and Questionnaires",,"Allergens",,,,,,,,"Wu, A.Y., Immunotherapy-Vaccines for allergic diseases (2012) J Thorac Dis, 4, pp. 198-202. , PID: 22833826; Sampson, H.A., Update on food allergy (2004) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 113, pp. 805-819. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2cXjs1CisL0%3D, PID: 15131561; Branum, A.M., Lukacs, S.L., Food allergy among children in the United States (2009) Pediatrics, 124, pp. 1549-1555. , PID: 19917585; Branum, A.M., Lukacs, S.L., Food allergy among U.S. children: trends in prevalence and hospitalizations (2008) NCHS Data Brief, pp. 1-8; Grundy, J., Matthews, S., Bateman, B., Dean, T., Arshad, S.H., Rising prevalence of allergy to peanut in children: data from 2 sequential cohorts (2002) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 110, pp. 784-789. , PID: 12417889; Chafen, J.J., Newberry, S.J., Riedl, M.A., Bravata, D.M., Maglione, M., Suttorp, M.J., Diagnosing and managing common food allergies: a systematic review (2010) JAMA, 303, pp. 1848-1856. , PID: 20460624; Gupta, R.S., Springston, E.E., Warrier, M.R., Smith, B., Kumar, R., Pongracic, J., The prevalence, severity, and distribution of childhood food allergy in the United States (2011) Pediatrics, 128, pp. 9-17; Lin, R.Y., Anderson, A.S., Shah, S.N., Nurruzzaman, F., Increasing anaphylaxis hospitalizations in the first 2 decades of life: New York State, 1990–2006 (2008) Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol, 101, pp. 387-393. , PID: 18939727; Yocum, M.W., Butterfield, J.H., Klein, J.S., Volcheck, G.W., Schroeder, D.R., Silverstein, M.D., Epidemiology of anaphylaxis in Olmsted County: a population-based study (1999) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 104, pp. 452-456. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK1Mzot1entg%3D%3D, PID: 10452770; Ortolani, C., Bruijnzeel-Koomen, C., Bengtsson, U., Bindslev-Jensen, C., Björkstén, B., Høst, A., Controversial aspects of adverse reactions to food (1999) European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Reactions to Food Subcommittee.

We assessed co-occurrence of childhood asthma, rhinitis and eczema using unsupervised statistical techniques. Methods We included 17 209 children at 4 years and 14 585 at 8 years from seven European population-based birth cohorts (MeDALL project). At each age period, children were grouped, using partitioning cluster analysis, according to the distribution of 23 variables covering symptoms 'ever' and 'in the last 12 months', doctor diagnosis, age of onset and treatments of asthma, rhinitis and eczema; immunoglobulin E sensitization; weight; and height. We tested the sensitivity of our estimates to subject and variable selections, and to different statistical approaches, including latent class analysis and self-organizing maps. Results Two groups were identified as the optimal way to cluster the data at both age periods and in all sensitivity analyses. The first (reference) group at 4 and 8 years (including 70% and 79% of children, respectively) was characterized by a low prevalence of symptoms and sensitization, whereas the second (symptomatic) group exhibited more frequent symptoms and sensitization. Ninety-nine percentage of children with comorbidities (co-occurrence of asthma, rhinitis and/or eczema) were included in the symptomatic group at both ages. The children's characteristics in both groups were consistent in all sensitivity analyses. Conclusion At 4 and 8 years, at the population level, asthma, rhinitis and eczema can be classified together as an allergic comorbidity cluster. Future research including time-repeated assessments and biological data will help understanding the interrelationships between these diseases. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Recently, low gut microbial diversity during infancy has also been linked with later development of allergies. We investigated whether presence of older siblings, furred pets and early life infections affected gut microbial communities at 9 and 18 months of age and whether these differences were associated with the cumulative prevalence of atopic symptoms of eczema and asthmatic bronchitis at 3 years of age. Bacterial compositions and diversity indices were determined in fecal samples collected from 114 infants in the SKOT I cohort at age 9 and 18 months by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These were compared to the presence of older siblings, furred pets and early life infections and the cumulative prevalence of diagnosed asthmatic bronchitis and self-reported eczema at 3 years of age. Results: The number of older siblings correlated positively with bacterial diversity (p = 0.030), diversity of the phyla Firmicutes (p = 0.013) and Bacteroidetes (p = 0.004) and bacterial richness (p = 0.006) at 18 months. Further, having older siblings was associated with increased relative abundance of several bacterial taxa at both 9 and 18 months of age. Compared to the effect of having siblings, presence of household furred pets and early life infections had less pronounced effects on the gut microbiota. Gut microbiota characteristics were not significantly associated with cumulative occurrence of eczema and asthmatic bronchitis during the first 3 years of life. Conclusions: Presence of older siblings is associated with increased gut microbial diversity and richness during early childhood, which could contribute to the substantiation of the hygiene hypothesis. However, no associations were found between gut microbiota and atopic symptoms of eczema and asthmatic bronchitis during early childhood and thus further studies are required to elucidate whether sibling-associated gut microbial changes influence development of allergies later in childhood. © 2015 Laursen et al.","Alpha diversity; Asthmatic bronchitis; Early life infections; Eczema furred pets; Gut microbiota; Infants; Older siblings; Richness; SKOT I cohort","RNA 16S; bacterial DNA; ribosome DNA; Article; Bacteroidetes; bronchitis; child; eczema; feces microflora; Firmicutes; gene sequence; human; intestine flora; microbial diversity; otitis media; pet animal; pneumonia; preschool child; school child; sibling; species richness; asthma; bacterium; chemistry; classification; cluster analysis; DNA sequence; eczema; feces; genetics; infant; microbiology; microflora; molecular genetics; phylogeny; prevalence; sibling; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Firmicutes; Asthma; Bacteria; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Eczema; Feces; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Infant; Microbiota; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Prevalence; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Siblings",,"DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",,,,,,,,"Strachan, D.P., Hay fever, hygiene, and household size (1989) BMJ, 299, pp. 1259-1260. , 1:STN:280:DyaK3c7gsFyhsA%3D%3D 1838109 2513902; Karmaus, W., Botezan, C., Does a higher number of siblings protect against the development of allergy and asthma?

This study explored the effects of school meals rich in fish, vegetables and fibre on school attendance, asthma, allergies and illness in 797 Danish 8-to 11-year-old children. No comparable studies conducted in high-income settings have been identified.Subjects/Methods:The OPUS School Meal Study was a cluster-randomised cross-over trial. Children from third and fourth grades at nine Danish schools received school meals or usual packed lunch (control) for two 3-month periods. Occurrence and duration of illnesses, asthma and allergies during the last 14 days were recorded by parental questionnaires at baseline and after each 3-month period. Self-reported well-being was assessed by visual analogue scales.Results:The school meals did not affect school attendance, parent-reported occurrence or duration of asthma and allergies or self-reported well-being. The most common symptoms of illness were stomach pain (24%), headache (28%) and cold (24%). A slightly higher number of children experienced headaches in the school meal (27%) compared with the control period (22%) (P=0.02). However, subgroup analyses showed that this effect was only seen in children eating school meals in the classroom (P=0.007), and not in common dining areas (P=0.2). No effect was found on other symptoms of illness.Conclusions:Provision of nutritionally balanced school meals did not affect school attendance, asthma, allergies, illness or well-being in 8-to 11-year-old children. The slight increase in occurrence of headaches seems to be related to the physical eating environment. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"absenteeism; allergy; Article; asthma; child; child nutrition; childhood disease; common cold; controlled study; crossover procedure; Danish citizen; diarrhea; disease duration; drug use; eczema; fast food; female; fever; fish; headache; human; major clinical study; male; meal; nutritional assessment; pollen allergy; randomized controlled trial; school child; school meal; self report; sore throat; stomach pain; vegetable; vomiting; wellbeing; asthma; catering service; child welfare; cluster analysis; Denmark; diet; headache; hypersensitivity; meal; questionnaire; school; school health service; standards; statistics and numerical data; Asthma; Child; Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Child Welfare; Cluster Analysis; Cross-Over Studies; Denmark; Diet; Female; Food Services; Headache; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Lunch; Male; Meals; School Health Services; Schools; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,"Nordea-fonden: 02-2010-0389","We thank participating children, their families, school managements, teachers and other staff, as well as the entire study team, for their contribution to the study.

Data from population studies are essential to determine whether there are differential drivers of multi-allergy phenotypes. We aimed to define phenotypes and risk factors of allergic disease using latent class analysis (LCA). Methods: The HealthNuts study is a prospective, population-based cohort of 5276 12-month-old infants in Melbourne, Australia. LCA was performed using the following baseline data collected at age 12 months: food sensitization (skin prick test ≥ 2 mm) and allergy (oral food challenge) to egg, peanut and sesame; early (< 4 months) and late-onset eczema; and wheeze in the first year of life. Risk factors were modelled using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Five distinct phenotypes were identified: no allergic disease (70%), non-food-sensitized eczema (16%), single egg allergy (9%), multiple food allergies (predominantly peanut) (3%) and multiple food allergies (predominantly egg) (2%). Compared to the baseline group of no allergic disease, shared risk factors for all allergic phenotypes were parents born overseas (particularly Asia), delayed introduction of egg, male gender (except for single egg allergy) and family history of allergic disease, whilst exposure to pet dogs was protective for all phenotypes. Other factors including filaggrin mutations, vitamin D and the presence of older siblings differed by phenotype. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Multiple outcomes in infancy can be used to determine five distinct allergy phenotypes at the population level, which have both shared and separate risk factors suggesting differential mechanisms of disease. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Eczema; Food allergy; Latent class analysis; Phenotypes; Population study","filaggrin; food allergen; vitamin D; allergen; intermediate filament protein; allergic disease; Article; clinical practice; eczema; egg allergy; environmental exposure; family history; female; food allergy; human; infant; loss of function mutation; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; peanut allergy; phenotype; population genetics; population research; prevalence; prick test; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; sesame; wheezing; adverse effects; Australia; cohort analysis; environment; food; Food Hypersensitivity; health survey; immunology; statistical model; Allergens; Australia; Cohort Studies; Environment; Female; Food; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Infant; Intermediate Filament Proteins; Male; Models, Statistical; Phenotype; Population Surveillance; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Vitamin D",,"Allergens; filaggrin; Intermediate Filament Proteins; Vitamin D",,,,,,,,"Burgess, J.A., Dharmage, S.C., Byrnes, G.B., Childhood eczema and asthma incidence and persistence: a cohort study from childhood to middle age (2008) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 122, pp. 280-285; Spergel, J.M., Epidemiology of atopic dermatitis and atopic march in children (2010) Immunol Allergy Clin North Am, 30, pp. 269-280; Penard-Morand, C., Raherison, C., Kopferschmitt, C., Prevalence of food allergy and its relationship to asthma and allergic rhinitis in schoolchildren (2005) Allergy, 60, pp. 1165-1171; Illi, S., von Mutius, E., Lau, S., The pattern of atopic sensitization is associated with the development of asthma in childhood (2001) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 108, pp. 709-714; Kjaer, H.F., Eller, E., Andersen, K.E., Host, A., Bindslev-Jensen, C., The association between early sensitization patterns and subsequent allergic disease.

Until recently, CVA6 infections were considered as being of minor clinical significance, and only rarely aetiologically linked with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) associated with other species A enteroviruses (particularly EV71 and CVA16). From 2008 onwards, however, CVA6 infections have been associated with several outbreaks worldwide of atypical HFMD (aHFMD) accompanied by a varicelliform rash. We recently reported CVA6-associated eczema herpeticum occurring predominantly in children and young adults in Edinburgh in January and February 2014. To investigate genetic determinants of novel clinical phenotypes of CVA6, we genetically characterized and analysed CVA6 variants associated with eczema herpeticum in Edinburgh in 2014 and those with aHFMD in CAV isolates collected from 2008. A total of eight recombinant forms (RFs) have circulated worldwide over the past 10 years, with the particularly recent appearance of RF-H associated with eczema herpeticum cases in Edinburgh in 2014. Comparison of phylogenies and divergence of complete genome sequences of CVA6 identified recombination breakpoints in 2A–2C, within VP3, and between 59 untranslated region and VP1. A Bayesian temporal reconstruction of CVA6 evolution since 2004 provided estimates of dates and the actual recombination events that generated more recently appearing recombination groups (RF-E, -F, -G and -H). Associations were observed between recombination groups and clinical presentations of herpangina, aHFMD and eczema herpeticum, but not with VP1 or other structural genes. These observations provided evidence that NS gene regions may potentially contribute to clinical phenotypes and outcomes of CVA6 infection. © 2015 The Authors.",,"protein VP1; virus RNA; 5' untranslated region;

On the basis of this patient's indication, infection was suspected in 41 other subjects. This study investigated (1) the knowledge of the travelers about the risks of schistosomiasis and their related behavior to evaluate the appropriateness of prevention messages and (2) the diagnostic workup of symptomatic travelers by general practitioners to evaluate medical care of travelers with a history of freshwater exposure in tropical areas. Methods A questionnaire was sent to the 42 travelers with potential exposure to schistosomiasis. It focused on pre-travel knowledge of the disease, bathing conditions, clinical presentation, first suspected diagnosis, and treatment. Results Of the 42 questionnaires, 40 (95%) were returned, among which 37 travelers (92%) reported an exposure to freshwater, and 18 (45%) were aware of the risk of schistosomiasis. Among these latter subjects, 16 (89%) still reported an exposure to freshwater. Serology was positive in 28 (78%) of 36 exposed subjects at least 3 months after exposure. Of the 28 infected travelers, 23 (82%) exhibited symptoms and 16 (70%) consulted their general practitioner before the information about the outbreak had spread, but none of these patients had a serology for schistosomiasis done during the first consultation. Conclusions The usual prevention message of avoiding freshwater contact when traveling in tropical regions had no impact on the behavior of these travelers, who still went swimming at the Lily waterfalls. This prevention message should, therefore, be either modified or abandoned. The clinical presentation of acute schistosomiasis is often misleading. General practitioners should at least request an eosinophil count, when confronted with a returning traveler with fever. If eosinophilia is detected, it should prompt the search for a parasitic disease. © 2015 International Society of Travel Medicine.",,"corticosteroid; fresh water; praziquantel; abdominal pain; adolescent; adult; allergy; amebiasis; angioneurotic edema; Article; attitude to health; awareness; clinical article; clinical feature; clinical practice; consultation; coughing; diagnostic error; diarrhea; eczema; emporiatrics; environmental exposure; eosinophil count; female; fever; gastroenteritis; human; malaria; male; middle aged; pneumonia; pruritus; rash; rheumatic disease; schistosomiasis; serology; swimming; travel; tropics; typhoid fever; virus infection; acute disease; aged; animal; attitude to health; blood; cluster analysis; eosinophilia; general practitioner; Madagascar; parasitology; questionnaire; risk assessment; schistosomiasis; travel; Acute Disease; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animals; Cluster Analysis; Eosinophilia; Female; Fever; Fresh Water; General Practitioners; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Madagascar; Male; Middle Aged; Praziquantel; Risk Assessment; Schistosomiasis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Travel",,"praziquantel, 55268-74-1; Praziquantel",,,,,,,,"Grobusch, M.P., Mühlberger, N., Jelinek, T., Imported schistosomiasis in Europe: Sentinel surveillance data from TropNetEurop (2003) J Travel Med, 10, pp. 164-169; Bottieau, E., Clerinx, J., Schrooten, W., Etiology and outcome of fever after a stay in the tropics (2006) Arch Intern Med, 166, pp. 1642-1648; Nicholls, D.J., Weld, L.H., Schwartz, E., Characteristics of schistosomiasis in travelers reported to the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network 1997-2008 (2008) Am J Trop Med Hyg, 79, pp. 729-734; Jauréguiberry, S., Ansart, S., Perez, L., Acute schistosomiasis: Two cases associated with cerebral vasculitis (2007) Am J Trop Med Hyg, 76, pp. 964-966; Epelboin, L., Jauréguiberry, S., Estève, J.B., Myocarditis during acute schistosomiasis in two travelers (2010) Am J Trop Med Hyg, 82, pp. 365-367; Ferreira, C.R., Campos, F.P.F., Ramos, J.G., Schistosomiasis: A case of severe infection with fatal outcome (2012) Autops Case Rep, 2, pp. 7-17. , http://www2.hu.usp.br/v2n1/, Available at:.

However, most of these markers are not only psoriasis-specific but also found in other inflammatory disorders. We performed an unsupervised cluster analysis of gene expression profiles in 150 psoriasis patients and other inflammatory skin diseases (atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, contact eczema, and healthy controls). We identified a cluster of IL-17/tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-associated genes specifically expressed in psoriasis, among which IL-36γ was the most outstanding marker. In subsequent immunohistological analyses, IL-36γ was confirmed to be expressed in psoriasis lesions only. IL-36γ peripheral blood serum levels were found to be closely associated with disease activity, and they decreased after anti-TNFα-treatment. Furthermore, IL-36γ immunohistochemistry was found to be a helpful marker in the histological differential diagnosis between psoriasis and eczema in diagnostically challenging cases. These features highlight IL-36γ as a valuable biomarker in psoriasis patients, both for diagnostic purposes and measurement of disease activity during the clinical course. Furthermore, IL-36γ might also provide a future drug target, because of its potential amplifier role in TNFα- and IL-17 pathways in psoriatic skin inflammation. © 2015 The Society for Investigative Dermatology.",,"biological marker; CXCL9 chemokine; cytokine; etanercept; interleukin 17; interleukin 19; interleukin 36 gamma; macrophage inflammatory protein 3beta; platelet derived growth factor; protein S 100; suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; biological marker; IL36G protein, human; interleukin 1; interleukin 17; Article; atopic dermatitis; contact dermatitis; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; disease activity; disease course; down regulation; eczema; follow up; gene cluster; gene expression; gene expression profiling; genetic association; human; human tissue; immunohistology; lichen planus; major clinical study; mycosis fungoides; pityriasis lichenoides; predictive value; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; psoriasis; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; pustular psoriasis; skin biopsy; skin defect; skin lupus erythematosus; systemic therapy; tinea; treatment duration; upregulation; biopsy; gene expression regulation; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; metabolism; psoriasis; skin disease; Biological Markers; Biopsy; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Inflammation; Interleukin-1; Interleukin-17; Predictive Value of Tests; Psoriasis; Skin Diseases",,"etanercept, 185243-69-0, 200013-86-1; interleukin 19, 204338-30-7; macrophage inflammatory protein 3beta, 181030-14-8; thymus and activation regulated chemokine, 181532-29-6; Biological Markers; IL36G protein, human; Interleukin-1; Interleukin-17",,,"0306v12

Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is commonly used in combination for eczema due to the complicated pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify a CHM network for the treatment of eczema by using a nationwide database. During 2011, 381,282 CHM prescriptions made for eczema (ICD-9-CM 692.x) were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan and analyzed by using association rule mining and social network analysis. Among 661 available CHMs, 44 important combinations were identified. Among the CHM networks, seven clusters with the predominant traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pattern were recognized. The largest CHM cluster was used to treat the wind-dampness-heat pattern, and Xiao-Feng-San (24.1% of all prescriptions) was the core of this cluster with anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and antiallergic effects. Lonicera japonica (11.0% of all prescriptions) with Forsythia suspense (17.0% of all prescriptions) was the most commonly used CHM combination and was also the core treatment for treating the heat pattern, in which an antimicrobial effect is found. CHM network analysis is helpful for TCM doctors or researchers to choose candidates for clinical practice or further studies. © 2015 Hsing-Yu Chen et al.",,"Chinese drug; herbaceous agent; unclassified drug; Xiao Feng San; adolescent; adult; aged; antiinflammatory activity; antimicrobial activity; antioxidant activity; Article; child; Chinese medicine; cluster analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; data base; data mining; drug formulation; eczema; female; Forsythia suspensa; herbal medicine; human; ICD-9-CM; Lonicera japonica; major clinical study; male; middle aged; national health insurance; physician; prescription; priority journal; school child; social network; Taiwan; young adult",,,,,,,,,,"Cortesi, P.A., Scalone, L., Belisari, A., Cost and quality of life in patients with severe chronic hand eczema refractory to standard therapy with topical potent corticosteroids (2014) Contact Dermatitis, 70 (3), pp. 158-168; Hay, R.J., Johns, N.E., Williams, H.C., The global burden of skin disease in 2010: An analysis of the prevalence and impact of skin conditions (2013) Journal of Investigative Dermatology; Langan, S.M., Schmitt, J., Williams, H.C., Smith, S., Thomas, K.S., How are eczema ""flares"" defined?

We aimed to the explore associations of prenatal exposures to a large set of environmental chemical contaminants with asthma and eczema in school-age children. Methods We studied 1024 mother-child pairs from Greenland and Ukraine from the INUENDO birth cohort. Data were collected by means of an interview-based questionnaire when the children were 5-9 years of age. Questions from the ISAAC study were used to define asthma, eczema, and wheeze. We applied principal components analysis (PCA) to sixteen contaminants in maternal serum sampled during pregnancy, including perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), metabolites of diethylhexyl (DEHP) and diisononyl (DiNP) phthalates, PCB-153, and p,p'-DDE. Scores of five principal components (PCs) explaining 70% of the variance were included in multiple logistic regression models. Results In a meta-analysis that included both populations, the PC2 score, reflecting exposure to DiNP, was negatively associated with current eczema (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96). Other associations were not consistent between the two populations. In Ukrainian children, the PC3 score (DEHP) was positively associated with current wheeze (adjusted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.03-2.37), whereas the PC5 score, dominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was inversely associated with current wheeze (OR 0.64, 0.41-0.99). In Greenlandic children, a negative association of PC4 (organochlorines) with ever eczema (OR 0.78, 0.61-0.99) was found. Conclusions We found limited evidence to support a link between prenatal exposure to environmental chemical contaminants and childhood asthma and eczema. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, little is known about the sleep disturbances that occur in adult eczema. We studied the association between adult eczema and sleep disturbance and their impact on overall health and health care utilization. We used the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, a cross-sectional questionnaire of 34,613 adults. Eczema was associated with higher odds of fatigue (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.97 (2.65-3.34)), regular daytime sleepiness (2.66 (2.34-3.01)), and regular insomnia (2.36 (2.11-2.64)), even after controlling for sleep duration, history of allergic disease, sociodemographics, and body mass index. There were significant interactions between eczema and fatigue, sleepiness, and insomnia as predictors of poorer overall health status, number of sick days, and doctor visits, such that eczema and each of the sleep symptoms were associated with higher odds of poorer outcomes than either eczema or sleep symptoms alone. Latent class analysis was used and identified five classes of fatigue, sleep disturbances, and allergic disorders. Two classes had high probabilities of eczema: one with high probabilities of asthma, hay fever, food allergy, and multiple sleep symptoms and the other with intermediate probability of insomnia alone.

Cluster analysis was performed on those with rhinitis at age 18 years (n = 468) by using 13 variables defining clinical characteristics.Results Four clusters were identified. Patients in cluster 1 (n = 128 [27.4%]; ie, moderate childhood-onset rhinitis) had high atopy and eczema prevalence and high total IgE levels but low asthma prevalence. They showed the best lung function at 18 years of age, with normal fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Feno), low bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), and low bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) but high rhinitis symptoms and treatment. Patients in cluster 2 (n = 199 [42.5%]; ie, mild-adolescence-onset female rhinitis) had the lowest prevalence of comorbid atopy, asthma, and eczema. They had normal lung function and low BHR, BDR, Feno values, and total IgE levels plus low rhinitis symptoms, severity, and treatment. Patients in cluster 3 (n = 59 [12.6%]; ie, severe earliest-onset rhinitis with asthma) had the youngest rhinitis onset plus the highest comorbid asthma (of simultaneous onset) and atopy. They showed the most obstructed lung function with high BHR, BDR, and Feno values plus high rhinitis symptoms, severity, and treatment. Patient 4 in cluster 4 (n = 82 [17.5%]; ie, moderate childhood-onset male rhinitis with asthma) had high atopy, intermediate asthma, and low eczema. They had impaired lung function with high Feno values and total IgE levels but intermediate BHR and BDR. They had moderate rhinitis symptoms.Conclusion Clinically distinctive adolescent rhinitis clusters are apparent with varying sex and asthma associations plus differing rhinitis severity and treatment needs.Background Rhinitis affects many young adults and often shows comorbidity with asthma. © 2014 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","Asthma; cluster analysis; morbidity; rhinitis; wheezing","antihistaminic agent; immunoglobulin E; nitric oxide; steroid; immunoglobulin E; nitric oxide; adolescent; adult; Article; asthma; atopy; bronchial hyperresponsiveness; bronchodilator reversibility; child; clinical feature; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; comorbidity; disease association; disease severity; eczema; female; fraction of exhaled nitric oxide; genetic heterogeneity; groups by age; human; lung function; major clinical study; male; normal value; obstructive airway disease; onset age; patient identification; preschool child; prevalence; respiratory tract parameters; rhinitis; school child; sex difference; steroid therapy; young adult; asthma; blood; Bronchial Hyperreactivity; cluster analysis; eczema; forced expiratory volume; Great Britain; infant; maximal mid expiratory flow; metabolism; pathophysiology; rhinitis; risk factor; Adolescent; Asthma; Bronchial Hyperreactivity; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Cohort Studies; Eczema; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Great Britain; Humans; Immunoglobulin E; Infant; Male; Maximal Midexpiratory Flow Rate; Nitric Oxide; Prevalence; Rhinitis; Risk Factors",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; Immunoglobulin E; Nitric Oxide",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

Data Collection Physicians completed structured and semistructured interviews plus chart notes about clinical management and attitudes. Principal Findings Physicians reported more negative attitudes for patients with schizophrenia with bizarre affect (SBA). There were few differences in clinical decisions measured quantitatively or in charting, but qualitative data revealed less trust of patients with SBA as reporters, with more reliance on sources other than engaging the patient in care. Physicians often alerted colleagues about SBA, thereby shaping expectations before interactions occurred. Conclusions Results are consistent with common stereotypes about people with serious mental illness. Vignettes did not include intentional indication of unreliable reporting or danger. Reducing health care disparities requires attention to subtle aspects of managing patients - particularly those with atypical affect - as seemingly slight differences could engender disparate patient experiences over time. © Health Research and Educational Trust.","Clinical decision making; diabetes; mental illness; stigma","adult; aged; Article; clinical decision making; comorbidity; controlled study; depression; diabetes mellitus; doctor patient relation; eczema; factorial analysis; female; general practitioner; health care disparity; human; male; medical documentation; mental disease; mood disorder; patient care; physician attitude; randomized controlled trial; schizophrenia; semi structured interview; structured interview; treatment planning; decision making; diabetes mellitus; health personnel attitude; interview; Mental Disorders; middle aged; psychology; teaching; Adult; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Comorbidity; Decision Making; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Patient Simulation; Physicians, Primary Care",,,,,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: K01MH100428, R01MH081824",,,,,"Arboleda-Florez, J., Stuart, H., From Sin to Science: Fighting the Stigmatization of Mental Illnesses (2012) Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 57 (8), pp. 457-463; Bunce, D.F., II, Jones, L.R., Badger, L.W., Jones, S.E., Medical Illness in Psychiatric Patients: Barriers to Diagnosis and Treatment (1982) Southern Medical Journal, 75 (8), pp. 941-944; Consensus Development Conference on Antipsychotic Drugs and Obesity and Diabetes.

Classification has centered on phenotypes often derived using subjective criteria, small samples, and/or with little data for young children. This is particularly problematic as asthmatic features appear to be entrenched by age 6/7. In this paper we aim to: identify longitudinal trajectories of wheeze and other atopic symptoms in early childhood; characterize the resulting trajectories by the socio-economic background of children; and identify potentially modifiable processes in infancy correlated with these trajectories.Data and Methods: The Millennium Cohort Study is a large, representative birth cohort of British children born in 2000- 2002. Our analytical sample includes 11,632 children with data on key variables (wheeze in the last year; ever hay-fever and/ or eczema) reported by the main carers at age 3, 5 and 7 using a validated tool, the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood module. We employ longitudinal Latent Class Analysis, a clustering methodology which identifies classes underlying the observed population heterogeneity.Results: Our model distinguished four latent trajectories: a trajectory with both low levels of wheeze and other atopic symptoms (54% of the sample); a trajectory with low levels of wheeze but high prevalence of other atopic symptoms (29%); a trajectory with high prevalence of both wheeze and other atopic symptoms (9%); and a trajectory with high levels of wheeze but low levels of other atopic symptoms (8%). These groups differed in terms of socio-economic markers and potential intervenable factors, including household damp and breastfeeding initiation.Conclusion: Using data-driven techniques, we derived four trajectories of asthmatic symptoms in early childhood in a large, population based sample. These groups differ in terms of their socio-economic profiles. We identified correlated intervenable pathways in infancy, including household damp and breastfeeding initiation. © 2014 Panico et al.",,"Article; asthma; atopy; breast feeding; child; child health; cohort analysis; disease activity; disease classification; disease course; eczema; female; hay fever; human; longitudinal study; male; preschool child; prevalence; school child; socioeconomics; symptomatology; wheezing; abnormal respiratory sound; asthma; cluster analysis; housing; infant; pathophysiology; phenotype; risk factor; social class; statistical model; United Kingdom; Asthma; Breast Feeding; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Cohort Studies; England; Female; Housing; Humans; Infant; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Models, Statistical; Phenotype; Prevalence; Respiratory Sounds; Risk Factors; Social Class",,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/J019119/1",,,,,"Kuehni, C.E., Davis, A., Brooke, A.M., Silverman, M., (2001) Are All Wheezing Disorders in Very Young (Preschool) Children Increasing in Prevalence? the Lancet, 357, pp. 1821-1825; Burr, M.L., Wat, D., Evans, C., Dunstan, F.D., Doull, I.J., Asthma prevalence in 1973, 1988 and 2003 (2006) Thorax, 61, pp. 296-299; Pearce, N., Aït-Khaled, N., Beasley, R., Mallol, J., Keil, U., Worldwide trends in the prevalence of asthma symptoms: Phase iii of the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood (ISAAC) (2007) Thorax, 62, pp. 758-766; Panico, L., Bartley, M., Marmot, M., Nazroo, J.Y., Sacker, A., Ethnic variation in childhood asthma and wheezing illnesses: Findings from the Millennium Cohort Study (2007) International Journal of Epidemiology, 36, pp. 1093-1102; Fuller, E., (2006) Children's Health.

In routine care it can also be used to improve treatment strategies or to enhance patients' self-awareness and empowerment. Therefore a disease-specific instrument is needed that assesses in detail all the impairments caused by the disease of interest. For patients with hand eczema (HE) such an instrument was developed by an international expert group, but its measurement properties are unknown.OBJECTIVES: To validate the German version of the Quality of Life in Hand Eczema Questionnaire (QOLHEQ), which covers the domains of (i) symptoms, (ii) emotions, (iii) functioning and (iv) treatment and prevention.METHODS: The QOLHEQ was assessed up to three times in 316 patients with HE to test reliability and sensitivity to change. To test construct validity we also assessed several reference measures. The scale structure was analysed using the Rasch model for each subscale and a structural equation model was used to test the multi domain structure of the QOLHEQ.RESULTS: After minor adaptions of the scoring structure, all four subscales of the QOLHEQ did not significantly misfit the Rasch model (α > 0·05). The fit indices of the structural equation model showed a good fit of the multi domain construct with four subscales assessing HRQOL. Nearly all a priori-defined hypotheses relating to construct validity could be confirmed. The QOLHEQ showed a sensitivity to change that was superior compared with all reference measures.CONCLUSIONS: The QOLHEQ is ready to be used in its German version as a sensitive outcome measure in clinical trials and for routine monitoring. The treatment-relevant subscales enable its use to enhance patients' self-awareness and to monitor treatment decisions. © 2014 British Association of Dermatologists.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; clinical trial; eczema; female; hand disease; human; male; middle aged; multicenter study; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; reproducibility; standards; validation study; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Eczema; Female; Hand Dermatoses; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13652133,,,"24397866","English","Br.

B cells lose CD5 and acquire CD27 during maturation from immature via mature/naive to Ig-secreting cells and memory cells. We sought to investigate B cell maturation in relation to development of allergic disease and sensitization in the FARMFLORA birth cohort including 65 Swedish children. Total B cell numbers, proportions of CD5+ and CD27+ B cells, and levels of IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE were measured in blood on repeated occasions from birth to 36 mo of age, and related to allergic disease and sensitization at 18 and 36 mo of age with multivariate discriminant analysis. We also compared the expression of CD24 and CD38 within CD5 + and CD5neg B cells in children and in adults. We found that infants with a high proportion of CD5+ B cells at birth and at 1 mo of age had an increased risk for having allergic disease at 18 and 36 mo of life. Further, the proportions of CD5+ B cells at 1 mo of age were inversely correlated with total IgG levels at 18 and 36 mo of age. The majority of the CD5+ B cells were of a CD24hi/+CD38hi/+ immature/naive phenotype at birth (97%), 7 y of age (95%), and in adults (86%). These results suggest that development of allergic disease is preceded by an immaturity in neonatal B cell phenotype.

In patients affected by both psoriasis and nonatopic or atopic eczema simultaneously (n = 24), an intraindividual comparison of the molecular signatures of psoriasis and eczema identified genes and signaling pathways regulated in common and exclusive for each disease across all patients. Psoriasis-specific genes were important regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism, epidermal differentiation, as well as immune mediators of T helper 17 (TH17) responses, interleukin-10 (IL-10) family cytokines, and IL-36. Genes in eczema related to epidermal barrier, reduced innate immunity, increased IL-6, and a TH2 signature. Within eczema subtypes, a mutually exclusive regulation of epidermal differentiation genes was observed. Furthermore, only contact eczema was driven by inflammasome activation, apoptosis, and cellular adhesion. On the basis of this comprehensive picture of the pathogenesis of psoriasis and eczema, a disease classifier consisting of NOS2 and CCL27 was created. In an independent cohort of eczema (n = 28) and psoriasis patients (n = 25), respectively, this classifier diagnosed all patients correctly and also identified initially misdiagnosed or clinically undifferentiated patients.",,"cutaneous T cell attracting chemokine; cytokine; guanine deaminase; haptocorrin; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 10; interleukin 13; interleukin 36; interleukin 6; sclerostin; unclassified drug; adult; article; atopic dermatitis; C type lectin family member 4 gene; chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 27 gene; classifier; clinical article; comorbidity; contact dermatitis; controlled study; differentiation; down regulation; eczema; epidermis; female; gene; gene expression; gene ontology; glucose metabolism; guanine deaminase gene; human; human tissue; inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 gene; interleukin 13 gene; interleukin 36A gene; interleukin 36G gene; kallikrein related peptidase 13 gene; lipid metabolism; male; neuronal pentraxin 1 gene; pathogenesis; phospholipase A2 group IVG gene; principal component analysis; priority journal; psoriasis; psoriasis vulgaris; RH family C glycoprotein gene; sclerostin gene; serine transmembrane protease 11D gene; signal transduction; Th17 cell; Th2 cell; transcobalamin 1 gene; transglutaminase 1 gene; upregulation; cohort analysis; eczema; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; human genome; middle aged; pathology; psoriasis; Adult; Cohort Studies; Eczema; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genome, Human; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Principal Component Analysis; Psoriasis; Signal Transduction",,"guanine deaminase, 9033-16-3; haptocorrin, 12651-27-3; inducible nitric oxide synthase, 501433-35-8; interleukin 13, 148157-34-0",,,"259294",,,,,"Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis (2008) N.

The primary allergen was mixed fungal (52.4%). The highest percentage of allergen sIgE ≥ grade III accounted for the corresponding allergen positive cases was 71.1% (mixed fungal). Single factor analysis of clinical characteristics in the groups of AR and non AR showed that the history of months(χ(2) = -3.591), concomitant allergic conjunctivitis (χ(2) = 12.325) and cats or dogs at home (χ(2) = 5.615) were statistically significant between the two groups (all P < 0.05).In children with AR, single factor analysis of clinical characteristics in the groups of whether positive allergen level ≥ grade III showed that the concomitant asthma(χ(2) = 4.097), breastfeeding(χ(2) = 4.186), the housing situation (χ(2) = 4.360) and the bedroom toward (χ(2) = 4.656) were statistically significant between the two groups (all P < 0.05). In children with AR, single factor analysis of clinical characteristics in different age groups showed that the history of months(χ(2) = 64.999), concomitant eczema (χ(2) = 24.056), concomitant insect bite dermatitis (χ(2) = 9.148), cats or dogs at home (χ(2) = 8.529) and mother suffered from AR (χ(2) = 9.565) were statistically significant in different age groups (all P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: The study revealed that the longer of history, concomitant allergic conjunctivitis and cats or dogs at home are risk factors for AR;In children with AR, not breastfeeding and the bedroom toward back are risk factors for inhalation allergen sIgE ≥ gradeIII.OBJECTIVE: To study the high risk factors of allergen sensitization among 1-16 years old children with allergic rhinitis (AR) symptoms.METHODS: Medical history was collected from 518 children with AR symptoms aged 1 to 16 years old between April 2011 and November 2012, including five aspects:basic information, disease characteristics, associated with other allergic diseases, growth and development history and genetic history and so on.

We hypothesize that this expression does not adequately describe the natural history of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis during childhood. We propose that this paradigm arose from cross-sectional analyses of longitudinal studies, and may reflect a population pattern that may not predominate at the individual level.Data from 9,801 children in two population-based birth cohorts were used to determine individual profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis and whether the manifestations of these symptoms followed an atopic march pattern. Children were assessed at ages 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 y. We used Bayesian machine learning methods to identify distinct latent classes based on individual profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis. This approach allowed us to identify groups of children with similar patterns of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis over time.Using a latent disease profile model, the data were best described by eight latent classes: no disease (51.3%), atopic march (3.1%), persistent eczema and wheeze (2.7%), persistent eczema with later-onset rhinitis (4.7%), persistent wheeze with later-onset rhinitis (5.7%), transient wheeze (7.7%), eczema only (15.3%), and rhinitis only (9.6%). When latent variable modelling was carried out separately for the two cohorts, similar results were obtained. Highly concordant patterns of sensitisation were associated with different profiles of eczema, rhinitis, and wheeze. The main limitation of this study was the difference in wording of the questions used to ascertain the presence of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis in the two cohorts.The developmental profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis are heterogeneous; only a small proportion of children (∼7% of those with symptoms) follow trajectory profiles resembling the atopic march.Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary. © 2014 Belgrave et al.",,"allergy; Article; Bayesian learning; child; cohort analysis; disease severity; eczema; female; follow up; human; longitudinal study; population research; preschool child; prevalence; probability; questionnaire; rhinitis; school child; sensitization; skin test; symptom assessment; wheezing; Bayes theorem; cross-sectional study; eczema; male; pathology; Respiratory Sounds; rhinitis; Bayes Theorem; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Eczema; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Respiratory Sounds; Rhinitis",,,,,"0401540

We set out to define distinct allergic phenotypes by unsupervised cluster analysis. Study design A total of 18 variables were analyzed: sex and age, eczema and food allergy, asthma duration, asthma severity and control, severe exacerbations, total IgE level, allergic sensitization, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and functional parameters. Clusters obtained were cross-tabulated with environmental parameters. Results Four clusters were identified in 125 children (average age 8.9 years): (1) 57 children constituted the ""House dust mite Sensitization and Mild Asthma"" cluster, 98% of these were monosensitized and had mild asthma (74%); (2) 12 children had ""Pollen Sensitization with Severe Exacerbations,"" 92 % with severe exacerbations and pollen sensitization; (3) 20 children had ""Multiple Allergies and Severe Asthma,"" with 95% having moderate to severe asthma, and a significantly decreased forced expiratory flow rate at 25%-75% of forced vital capacity, 100% had eczema and higher values of IgE (1123 kU/L) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (67 ppb) (this cluster was associated with molds at home [P =.004]); and (4) 36 children had ""Multiple Allergic Sensitizations and Mild Asthma,"" 97% of these with multiple sensitizations and 100% mild asthma.

Study design Current wheeze was recorded 23 times up to age 7 years in a birth cohort at high risk for allergy (n = 620). Latent class analysis of wheeze responses identified 5 classes. Multinomial logistic regression estimated associations of probability-weighted wheezing classes with early-life factors. All phenotypes were compared with never/infrequent wheezers. Results Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) by 1 year (relative risk [RR], 3.00; 95% CI, 1.58-5.70), childcare by 1 year (RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02-2.22), and higher body mass index (RR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.09-5.81) were associated with increased risk of early transient wheeze, whereas breastfeeding was protective (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.90). LRTI (RR, 6.54; 95% CI, 2.55-16.76) and aeroallergen sensitization (RR, 4.95; 95% CI, 1.74-14.02) increased the risk of early persistent wheeze. LRTI (RR, 5.31; 95% CI, 2.71-10.41), eczema (RR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.78-4.31), aeroallergen sensitization (RR, 5.60; 95% CI, 2.86-10.9), and food sensitization (RR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.56-4.94) increased the risk of intermediate-onset wheeze, whereas dog exposure at baseline (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32-0.84) and first-born status (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32-0.76) were protective. Heavy parental smoking at birth (RR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.02-9.88) increased the risk of late-onset wheeze, whereas breastfeeding reduced it (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.12-0.96). All wheeze classes except early transient had greater risk of wheeze at age 12 years compared with never/infrequent wheezers. Conclusion We found distinct early-life risk factor profiles for each wheeze phenotype. These findings provide insight into possible wheeze mechanisms and have implications for identifying preventive strategies and addressing clinical management of early-life wheeze.","BMI; Body mass index; Latent class analysis; LCA; Lower respiratory tract infection; LRTI; MACS; Melbourne Atopy Cohort Study; Relative risk; RR","allergic asthma; allergic rhinitis; article; body mass; breast feeding; child; child care; comparative study; controlled study; double blind procedure; eczema; environmental exposure; eraly life risk factor; female; follow up; food allergy; food intake; health education; high risk infant; human; human experiment; infant; lower respiratory tract infection; male; newborn; parental smoking; phenotype; preschool child; priority journal; risk factor; school child; sensitization; social status; wheezing; Article; asthma; birth; educational status; high risk patient; longitudinal study; major clinical study; obesity; phenotype; randomized controlled trial; smoking; BMI; Body mass index; Latent class analysis; LCA; Lower respiratory tract infection; LRTI; MACS; Melbourne Atopy Cohort Study; Relative risk; RR; Allergens; Body Mass Index; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Infant; Male; Phenotype; Prognosis; Respiratory Sounds; Respiratory Tract Infections; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Tobacco Smoke Pollution",,,,,,,,,,"Bisgaard, H., Bønnelykke, K., Long-term studies of the natural history of asthma in childhood (2010) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 126, pp. 187-197; Agache, I., Akdis, C., Jutel, M., Virchow, J.C., Untangling asthma phenotypes and endotypes (2012) Allergy, 67, pp. 835-846; Spycher, B.D., Silverman, M., Kuehni, C.E., Phenotypes of childhood asthma: Are they real?

Even with levels of air pollutants below that allowed by law, the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis and associated symptoms tended to be higher in the central region school, where there is heavy vehicular traffic.","Air Pollution, adverse effects; Child; Environmental Health; Respiratory Hypersensitivity, epidemiology; Respiratory Tract Diseases, epidemiology","air pollutant; exhaust gas; adverse effects; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; asthma; Brazil; chemically induced; child; eczema; exhaust gas; factor analysis; female; human; male; prevalence; questionnaire; rhinitis; school; toxicity; urban population; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asthma; Brazil; Child; Eczema; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Rhinitis; Schools; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population; Vehicle Emissions",,"Air Pollutants; Vehicle Emissions",,,,,,,,"Castro, H.A., Cunha, M.F., Mendonça, G.A.S., Junger, W.L., Cunha-Cruz, J., Leon, A.P., Efeitos da poluição do ar na função respiratória de escolares, Rio de Janeiro, RJ (2009) Rev Saude Publica, 43 (1), pp. 26-34; Kempen, E., Fischer, P., Janssen, N., Houthuijs, D., Kampa, I., Stansfeld, S., Neurobehavioral effects of exposure to traffic-related air pollution and transportation noise in primary schoolchildren (2012) Environ Res, 115, pp. 18-25; Mazzoli-Rocha, F., Magalhães, C.B., Malm, O., Saldiva, P.H.N., Zin, W.A., Faffe, D.S., Comparative respiratory toxicity of particles produced by traffic and sugar cane burning (2008) Environ Res, 108 (1), pp. 35-41; McConnell, R., Berhane, K., Yao, L., Jerrett, M., Lurmann, F., Gilliland, F., Traffic, susceptibility and childhood asthma (2006) Environ Health Perspect, 114 (5), pp. 766-772; Olmo, N.R.S., Saldiva, P.H.N., Braga, A.L.F., Lin, C.A., Santos, U.P., Pereira, L.A.A., A review of low-level air pollution and adverse effects on human health: implications for epidemiological studies and public policy (2011) Clinics, 66 (4), pp. 681-690; Wandalsen, G.F., Camelo-Nunes, I.C., Mello, K.C., Naspitz, C.K., Solé, D., Risk factors for atopic eczema in school children (2005) Rev Bras Saude Mater Infant, 5 (1), pp. 19-25","dos Santos, A.P.M.Av.

Evidence points toward lifestyle as a major risk factor. AE is often the first symptom early in life later followed by food allergy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. Thus, there is a great need to find early, preferentially noninvasive, biomarkers to identify individuals that are predisposed to AE with the goal to prevent disease development. Objective: To investigate whether the protein abundances in vernix can predict later development of AE. Methods: Vernix collected at birth from 34 newborns within the Assessment of Lifestyle and Allergic Disease During INfancy (ALADDIN) birth cohort was included in the study. At 2 years of age, 18 children had developed AE. Vernix proteins were identified and quantified with liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Results: We identified and quantified 203 proteins in all vernix samples. An orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model was found with R2 = 0.85, Q2 = 0.39, and discrimination power between the AE and healthy group of 73.5%. Polyubiquitin-C and calmodulin-like protein 5 showed strong negative correlation to the AE group, with a correlation coefficient of 0.73 and 0.68, respectively, and a P-value of 8.2 E-7 and 1.8 E-5, respectively. For these two proteins, the OPLS-DA model showed a prediction accuracy of 91.2%. Conclusion: The protein abundances in vernix, and particularly that of polyubiquitin-C and calmodulin-like protein 5, are promising candidates as biomarkers for the identification of newborns predisposed to develop AE. © 2013 The Authors.

Timing of exposure and atopic status may be important effect modifiers. We collected cross-sectional data on asthma outcomes from Toronto school children aged 5-9years in 2006. Lifetime home, school and daycare addresses were obtained to derive birth and cumulative NO2 exposures for a nested case-control subset of 1497 children. Presence of other allergic disease (a proxy for atopy) was defined as self-report of one or more of doctor-diagnosed rhinitis, eczema, or food allergy. Generalized estimating equations were used to adjust for potential confounders, and examine hypothesized effect modifiers while accounting for clustering by school. In children with other allergic disease, birth, cumulative and 2006 NO2 were associated with lifetime asthma (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.08-1.98; 1.37, 95% CI 1.00-1.86; and 1.60, 95% CI 1.09-2.36 respectively per interquartile range increase) and wheeze (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.10-1.89; 1.31, 95% CI 1.02-1.67; and 1.60, 95% CI 1.16-2.21). No or weaker effects were seen in those without allergic disease, and effect modification was amplified when a more restrictive algorithm was used to define other allergic disease (at least 2 of doctor diagnosed allergic rhinitis, eczema or food allergy). The effects of modest NO2 levels on childhood asthma were modified by the presence of other allergic disease, suggesting a probable role for allergic sensitization in the pathogenesis of TRAP initiated asthma. © 2014.","Air pollution; Asthma; Atopy; Epidemiology; Traffic","Air pollution; Allergies; Epidemiology; Nitrogen oxides; Telecommunication traffic; Asthma; Atopy; Effect modifications; Generalized estimating equations; Inter quartile ranges; Nitrogen dioxides; Surrogate measures; Traffic-related air pollution; Diseases; nitrogen dioxide; allergy; asthma; atmospheric pollution; child health; epidemiology; nitrogen dioxide; pollution exposure; traffic emission; age distribution; air pollution; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; article; asthma; atopy; birth; Canada; case control study; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease activity; disease association; disease predisposition; eczema; environmental exposure; female; food allergy; geographic distribution; human; major clinical study; male; population research; preschool child; priority journal; school child; sensitization; traffic; wheezing; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto; Air pollution; Asthma; Atopy; Epidemiology; Traffic; Air Pollution; Asthma; Canada; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Male; Nitrogen Dioxide; Prevalence",,"nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0",,,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR

However, reported alcohol intake may be unreliable, and associations are likely to be confounded. Objective: We aimed to study the relation between prenatal alcohol exposure and atopic phenotypes in a large population-based birth cohort with the use of a Mendelian randomization approach to minimize bias and confounding. Methods: In white mothers and children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) we first analyzed associations between reported maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and atopic outcomes in the offspring measured at 7 years of age (asthma, wheezing, hay fever, eczema, atopy, and total IgE). We then analyzed the relation of maternal alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)1B genotype (rs1229984) with these outcomes (the A allele is associated with faster metabolism and reduced alcohol consumption and, among drinkers, would be expected to reduce fetal exposure to ethanol). Results: After controlling for confounders, reported maternal drinking in late pregnancy was negatively associated with childhood asthma and hay fever (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per category increase in intake: 0.91 [95% CI, 0.82-1.01] and 0.87 [95% CI, 0.78-0.98], respectively). However, maternal ADH1B genotype was not associated with asthma comparing carriers of A allele with persons homozygous for G allele (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.66-1.47]) or hay fever (OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.71-1.72]), nor with any other atopic outcome. Conclusion: We have found no evidence to suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure increases the risk of asthma or atopy in childhood. © 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","ADH1B; Alcohol; ALSPAC; asthma; atopy; birth cohort; Mendelian randomization; pregnancy; prenatal exposure","alcohol; alcohol dehydrogenase; immunoglobulin E; adult; alcohol consumption; alcohol metabolism; allele; article; asthma; atopy; binge drinking; childhood disease; disease association; eczema; educational status; female; genotype; hay fever; human; major clinical study; Mendelian randomization analysis; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; priority journal; third trimester pregnancy; wheezing; young adult; ADH; ADH1B; Alcohol; Alcohol dehydrogenase; ALSPAC; asthma; atopy; Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC); birth cohort; Genome Wide Association Study; GWAS; Mendelian randomization; PCA; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; Principal Components Analysis; Adult; Alcohol Dehydrogenase; Alcohol Drinking; Asthma; Child; Cohort Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Eczema; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genotype; Great Britain; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Genetic; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Risk; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; alcohol dehydrogenase, 9031-72-5; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,"Medical Research Council, MRC: G0600705, G0902144, G9815508, MC_PC_15018, MC_UU_12013/1",,,,,"Starkenburg, S., Munroe, M.E., Waltenbaugh, C., Early alteration in leukocyte populations and Th1/Th2 function in ethanol-consuming mice (2001) Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 25, pp. 1221-1230; Waltenbaugh, C., Vasquez, K., Peterson, J.D., Alcohol consumption alters antigen-specific Th1 responses: Mechanisms of deficit and repair (1998) Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 22, pp. 220S-223S; Oldenburg, P.J., Poole, J.A., Sisson, J.H., Alcohol reduces airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and allergic airway inflammation in mice (2012) Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol, 302, pp. 308-L315; Inselman, L.S., Fisher, S.E., Spencer, H., Atkinson, M., Effect of intrauterine ethanol exposure on fetal lung growth (1985) Pediatric Res, 19, pp. 12-14; Wang, X., Gomutputra, P., Wolgemuth, D.J., Baxi, L., Effects of acute alcohol intoxication in the second trimester of pregnancy on development of the murine fetal lung (2007) Am J Obstet Gynecol, 197, p. 269; Sozo, F., O'Day, L., Maritz, G., Kenna, K., Stacy, V., Brew, N., Repeated ethanol exposure during late gestation alters the maturation and innate immune status of the ovine fetal lung (2009) Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol, 296, pp. 510-L518; Giliberti, D., Mohan, S.S., Brown, L.A., Gauthier, T.W., Perinatal exposure to alcohol: Implications for lung development and disease (2013) Paediatr Respir Rev, 14, pp. 17-21; Linneberg, A., Nielsen, N.H., Madsen, F., Frolund, L., Dirksen, A., Jorgensen, T., Factors related to allergic sensitization to aeroallergens in a cross-sectional study in adults: The Copenhagen Allergy Study (2001) Clin Exp Allergy, 31, pp. 1409-1417; Linneberg, A., Petersen, J., Nielsen, N.H., Madsen, F., Frolund, L., Dirksen, A., The relationship of alcohol consumption to total immunoglobulin e and the development of immunoglobulin e sensitization: The Copenhagen Allergy Study (2003) Clin Exp Allergy, 33, pp. 192-198; Gonzalez-Quintela, A., Gude, F., Boquete, O., Rey, J., Meijide, L.M., Suarez, F., Association of alcohol consumption with total serum immunoglobulin e levels and allergic sensitization in an adult population-based survey (2003) Clin Exp Allergy, 33, pp. 199-205; Bjerke, T., Hedegaard, M., Henriksen, T.B., Nielsen, B.W., Schiotz, P.O., Several genetic and environmental factors influence cord blood IgE concentration (1994) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 5, pp. 88-94; Linneberg, A., Petersen, J., Gronbaek, M., Benn, C.S., Alcohol during pregnancy and atopic dermatitis in the offspring (2004) Clin Exp Allergy, 34, pp. 1678-1683; Bisgaard, H., Halkjaer, L.B., Hinge, R., Giwercman, C., Palmer, C., Silveira, L., Risk analysis of early childhood eczema (2009) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 123, pp. 1355-1360; Yuan, W., Sorensen, H.T., Basso, O., Olsen, J., Prenatal maternal alcohol consumption and hospitalization with asthma in childhood: A population-based follow-up study (2004) Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 28, pp. 765-768; Kelly, Y.J., Sacker, A., Gray, R., Kelly, J., Wolke, D., Head, J., Light drinking during pregnancy: Still no increased risk for socioemotional difficulties or cognitive deficits at 5 years of age?

Methods Questionnaires for primary screening were issued using the method of multi-stage stratified sampling. Suspected asthmatic children were given a second questionnaire, physical examination, medical history review, and auxiliary examination to confirm the diagnosis. Age-and sex-matched non-asthmatic children were randomly recruited to the control group. Results The number of valid questionnaires was 10 616 (5 444 males and 5 172 females). There were 308 confirmed asthma cases and the overall prevalence was 2.90%. The prevalence in boys was higher than that in girls (3.4% vs 2.4%). The prevalence in children under 3 years of age was 10.2%, which was higher than that in other age groups. The top three triggers for asthma attack in children were respiratory infection (94.2%), weather changes (89.0%), and exercise (35.1%). The most common asthma attack was moderate (71.8%), followed by mild (22.7%). Inhaled corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics were applied to 94.8% (292 cases), 74.7% (230 cases), and 90.9% (280 cases) of all patients, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated the following major risk factors for asthma: history of allergic rhinitis (OR=150.285, 95% CI: 31.934-707.264), history of eczema (OR=10.600, 95% CI: 1.054-106.624), history of atopic dermatitis (OR=31.368, 95% CI: 3.339-294.683), food allergies (OR=27.373, 95% CI: 2.670-280.621), method of birth (OR=2.853, 95% CI: 1.311-6.208), age of first antibiotic use (OR=0.384, 95% CI: 0.172-0.857), frequency of antibiotic use within 1 year of age (OR=9.940, 95% CI: 6.246-15.820), use of wall decorating materials (OR=2.108, 95% CI: 1.464-3.036), and use of heat supply in winter (OR=6.046, 95% CI: 1.034-35.362). Conclusions The prevalence of childhood asthma is associated with age and gender in Zhengzhou. Most asthma attacks are moderate, often triggered by respiratory infection. Treatment of asthma has been standardized, but still needs further improvement. History of allergic rhinitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis and food allergies, cesarean delivery, frequent use of antibiotics within 1 year of age, use of decorating materials on the wall, and use of heating in winter may increase risk for asthma, and use of antibiotics in older age is a protective factor against asthma in children.","Asthma; Child; Epidemiological survey; Risk factor","antibiotic agent; corticosteroid; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child; China; controlled study; eczema; female; food allergy; groups by age; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; multivariate logistic regression analysis; physical examination; preschool child; prevalence; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; respiratory tract infection; risk factor; stratified sample; urban area; weather; adolescent; asthma; infant; newborn; statistical model; Adolescent; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Epidemiologic Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Male; Questionnaires; Risk Factors",,,,,,,,,,"Mansour, E., Ahmed, A., Cortes, A., Mechanisms of metabisulfite-induced bronchoconstriction: Evidence for bradykinin B2-receptor stimulation[J] (1992) J Appl Physiol, 72 (5), pp. 1831-1837",,,,"Xiangya Hospital of CSU",,,,,10088830,,,"25523569","Chinese","Chin.

Previously, study size has limited the ability to compare and contrast the risk factor profiles among these heterogeneous subtypes. Methods: We pooled individual-level data from 17 471 NHL cases and 23 096 controls in 20 case-control studies from the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph). We estimated the associations, measured as odds ratios, between each of 11 NHL subtypes and self-reported medical history, family history of hematologic malignancy, lifestyle factors, and occupation. We then assessed the heterogeneity of associations by evaluating the variability (Q value) of the estimated odds ratios for a given exposure among subtypes. Finally, we organized the subtypes into a hierarchical tree to identify groups that had similar risk factor profiles. Statistical significance of tree partitions was estimated by permutation-based P values (PNODE). Results: Risks differed statistically significantly among NHL subtypes for medical history factors (autoimmune diseases, hepatitis C virus seropositivity, eczema, and blood transfusion), family history of leukemia and multiple myeloma, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and certain occupations, whereas generally homogeneous risks among subtypes were observed for family history of NHL, recreational sun exposure, hay fever, allergy, and socioeconomic status. Overall, the greatest difference in risk factors occurred between T-cell and B-cell lymphomas (PNODE &lt; 1.0 × 10-4), with increased risks generally restricted to T-cell lymphomas for eczema, T-cell-activating autoimmune diseases, family history of multiple myeloma, and occupation as a painter. We further observed substantial heterogeneity among B-cell lymphomas (PNODE &lt; 1.0 × 10-4). Increased risks for B-cell-activating autoimmune disease and hepatitis C virus seropositivity and decreased risks for alcohol consumption and occupation as a teacher generally were restricted to marginal zone lymphoma, Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphoma/leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and/or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Conclusions: Using a novel approach to investigate etiologic heterogeneity among NHL subtypes, we identified risk factors that were common among subtypes as well as risk factors that appeared to be distinct among individual or a few subtypes, suggesting both subtype-specific and shared underlying mechanisms. Further research is needed to test putative mechanisms, investigate other risk factors (eg, other infections, environmental exposures, and diet), and evaluate potential joint effects with genetic susceptibility.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; Australia; case control study; cluster analysis; comorbidity; ethnology; Europe; female; human; lifestyle; Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin; male; meta analysis; middle aged; North America; occupational exposure; odds ratio; risk factor; very elderly; young adult; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; agricultural worker; alcohol consumption; allergy; Article; autoimmune disease; B cell lymphoma; beer; blood transfusion; body mass; Burkitt lymphoma; chronic lymphatic leukemia; controlled study; eczema; family history; follicular lymphoma; genetic heterogeneity; hairy cell leukemia; hay fever; hematologic malignancy; Hepatitis C virus; interlymph non hodgkin lymphoma; large cell lymphoma; leukemia; major clinical study; mantle cell lymphoma; marginal zone lymphoma; medical history; multiple myeloma; mycosis fungoides; nonhodgkin lymphoma; painter; peripheral T cell lymphoma; scleroderma; self report; Sezary syndrome; small lymphocytic lymphoma; smoking; social status; sun exposure; systemic lupus erythematosus; systemic sclerosis; T cell lymphoma; teacher; Waldenstroem macroglobulinemia; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Australia; Case-Control Studies; Cluster Analysis; Comorbidity; Europe; Female; Humans; Life Style; Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin; Male; Middle Aged; North America; Occupational Exposure; Odds Ratio; Risk Factors; Young Adult",,,,,"99B083

The Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis is the only questionnaire developed specifically for assessment of psychosomatization in atopic dermatitis. Objectives: the objective of this study was to cross-culturally adapt and validate a Brazilian-Portuguese version of the Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis. Methods: adaptation consisted of independent translation and backtranslation by three bilingual translators, followed by a pre-test. The Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis and the Dermatology Life Quality Index were self-administered to 47 patients with atopic dermatitis. Disease severity was evaluated using the Eczema Area and Severity Index. Factor analysis was used to identify the dimensions of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis. Internal consistency and convergence validity were also analyzed. Reproducibility was assessed using the Kappa coefficient. Results: factor analysis revealed a two-dimensional structure: stress/laziness/insecurity (I) and maladjustment/social relationships (II), explaining 54.4% of total variance. All dimensions revealed excellent internal consistency. External construct validity was confirmed by positive correlations between the Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis and the Dermatology Life Quality Index. Test-retest reliability was excellent, with k>0.7 for all questions. Conclusions: the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties and can be used for the evaluation of psychosomatic symptoms in patients with atopic dermatitis and as a tool in clinical and epidemiological research. © 2014 by Anais Brasileiros de Dermatologia.","Atopic; Cost of illness; Dermatitis; Physiological; Psychological; Questionnaires; Stress; Validation studies","adult; atopic dermatitis; Brazil; cultural factor; female; human; male; mental stress; middle aged; procedures; psychology; psychometry; Psychophysiologic Disorders; publication; quality of life; questionnaire; reference value; reproducibility; standards; validation study; young adult; Adult; Brazil; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Psychophysiologic Disorders; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; Stress, Psychological; Translations; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,"Eichenfield, L.F., Hanifin, J.M., Luger, T.A., Stevens, S.R., Pride, H.B., Consensus conference on pediatric atopic dermatitis (2003) J Am Acad Dermatol, 49, pp. 1088-1095; Abramovits, W., Atopic dermatitis (2005) J Am Acad Dermatol, 53, pp. S86-S93; Ring, J., Alomar, A., Bieber, T., Deleuran, M., Fink-Wagner, A., Gelmetti, C., Guidelines for treatment of atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) part I (2012) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 26, pp. 1045-1060; Katsarou, A., Armenaka, M., Atopic dermatitis in older patients: Particular points (2011) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 25, pp. 12-18; Illi, S., Von Mutius, E., Lau, S., Nickel, R., Grüber, C., Niggemann, B., The natural course of atopic dermatitis from birth to age 7 years and the association with asthma (2004) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 113, pp. 925-931; Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis (2008) N Engl J Med, 358, pp. 1483-1494; Arndt, J., Smith, N., Tausk, F., Stress and atopic dermatitis (2008) Curr Allergy Asthma Rep, 8, pp. 312-317; Harth, W., Psychosomatic dermatology (psychodermatology) (2008) J Dtsch Dermatol Ges, 6, pp. 67-76; Lammintausta, K., Kalimo, K., Raitala, R., Forsten, Y., Prognosis of atopic dermatitis.

Skindex-29 is a self-report questionnaire developed to measure dermatology-specific quality of life. Aim: The objective of this study is to adapt this questionnaire to Polish conditions. The adaptation procedure involved the works on the linguistic content of the items and testing psychometric properties of the Polish version of Skindex-29, including item characteristics, factorial structure, aspects of reliability and validity. Material and methods: Two-hundred and ninety patients (63.4% women and 35.2% men) suffering from a range of skin conditions were recruited from several dermatological out-patient and in-patient clinics in Poland. Quality of life was measured using Skindex-29 and appropriate clinical data were collected. Results: The global score of Skindex-29 showed the normal distribution. Cronbach's α reliability coeficients were found to be high to very high for all Skindex-29 indexes. Factor analysis yielded four factors, in contrast to the original version of the questionnaire, for which a three-factor solution had been reported. Skindex-29 validity was demonstrated by showing the differences in the quality of life scores across different diagnostic categories, and between in-patients and out-patients. Skindex-29 global scores were found to be significantly predicted by the localization of the skin lesions on legs, anogenital areas and palms. Conclusions: The findings of this study support reliability and validity of the Polish version of Skindex-29, but they also raise questions to its three-factor structure.","Psychodermatology; Psychometric assessment; Quality of life","acne vulgaris; adolescent; adult; aged; alopecia areata; arm; article; atopic dermatitis; bacterial skin disease; burn; condyloma; contact dermatitis; controlled study; dermatitis; dermatitis herpetiformis; dermatomycosis; eczema; erythema; face; female; furunculosis; genital system; hand palm; head; herpes zoster; human; keratoderma; leg; leg ulcer; lichen planus; lipoma; major clinical study; male; male type alopecia; middle aged; mycosis fungoides; neck; nevus; normal distribution; outpatient department; pemphigus; pityriasis; Poland; Polish version of Skindex 29 questionnaire; psoriasis; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; rosacea; self report; skin allergy; skin disease; skin pruritus; stria; superficial thrombophlebitis; systemic lupus erythematosus; systemic sclerosis; trunk; urticaria; validity; verruca vulgaris; very elderly; vitiligo; young adult",,,,,,,,,,"Finlay, A.Y., Coles, E.C., The efect of severe psoriasis on the quality of life of 369 patients (1995) Br J Dermatol, 132, pp. 236-244; Koo, J., Population-based epidemiologic study of psoriasis with emphasis on quality of life assessment (1996) Dermatologic Clinics, 14 (3), pp. 485-496. , DOI 10.1016/S0733-8635(05)70376-4; Lasek, R.J., Chren, M.-M., Acne vulgaris and the quality of life of adult dermatology patients (1998) Archives of Dermatology, 134 (4), pp. 454-458. , DOI 10.1001/archderm.134.4.454; Lundberg, L., Johannesson, M., Silverdahl, M., Hermansson, C., Lindberg, M., Health-related quality of life in patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis measured with SF-36, DLQI and a subjective measure of disease activity (2000) Acta Dermato-Venereologica, 80 (6), pp. 430-434. , DOI 10.1080/000155500300012873; Finlay, A.Y., Ryan, T.J., Disability and handicap in dermatology (1996) International Journal of Dermatology, 35 (5), pp. 305-311; Finlay, A.Y., Skin Disease Disability: Measuring Its Magnitude (1998) Keio Journal of Medicine, 47 (3), pp. 131-134; Finlay, A.Y., Khan, G.K., Luscombe, D.K., Salek, M.S., Validation of sickness impact profile and psoriasis disability index in psoriasis (1990) Br J Dermatol, 123, pp. 751-756; Salek, M.S., Finlay, A.Y., Luscombe, D.K., Cyklosporin greatly improves the quality of life of adults with severe atopic dermatitis (1993) Br J Dermatol, 129, pp. 422-430; Motley, R.J., Finlay, A.Y., How much disability is caused by acne?

Some of the inconsistency is caused by the variable selection and demographic and clinical differences among study populations. Objectives: To investigate the effects of the choice of statistical method and different preparations of data on the clustering results; and to relate these to disease severity. Methods: Several variants of EFA and HC were applied and compared using various sets of variables and different encodings and transformations within a dataset of 383 children with asthma. Variables included lung function, inflammatory and allergy markers, family history, environmental exposures, and medications. Clusters and original variables were related to asthma severity (logistic regression and Bayesian network analysis). Measurements and Main Results: EFA identified five components (eigenvalues≥1) explaining 35% of the overall variance. Variations of the HC (as linkage-distance functions) did not affect the cluster inference; however, using different variable encodings and transformations did. The derived clusters predicted asthma severity less than the original variables. Prognostic factors of severity were medication usage, current symptoms, lung function, paternal asthma, bodymass index, and age of asthma onset. Bayesian networks indicated conditional dependence among variables. Conclusions: The use of different unsupervised statistical learning methods and different variable sets and encodings can lead to multiple and inconsistent subgroupings of asthma, not necessarily correlated with severity. The search for asthma phenotypes needs more careful selection of markers, consistent across different study populations, and more cautious interpretation of results from unsupervised learning.

The aim of this study was to investigate how parental hay fever, asthma, and eczema affect the risk of allergic rhinitis (AR) and nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) at 8 years of age. Methods Information on 2413 children from a population-based birth cohort was used combining questionnaire data and IgE to inhalant allergens. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between parental allergy-related disease and AR and NAR. In addition, cluster analysis was used to search for latent phenotypes of heredity likely to be associated with AR and NAR. Results At age 8 years, 13.8% of the children had AR, while 6.4% had NAR. Parental isolated hay fever increased the odds of AR (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.2), whereas isolated asthma or eczema did not. The odds of NAR increased when one parent had two or more allergy-related diseases. In the cluster analysis, the highest proportion of AR, 37.5%, was seen in a cluster where both parents had hay fever and pollen allergy and that of NAR, 11.0%, in a cluster where one parent had hay fever, pollen allergy, and eczema. Conclusions Parental allergy-related disease may be an important risk factor for NAR as well as AR, and the risk is comparable for maternal and paternal allergy. Parental hay fever seems to be the dominating hereditary risk factor for AR. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Assessing patients' atopic dermatitis and their parents' topical corticosteroid phobia is an essential step to improving adherence to treatment. Because topical corticophobia appears to be a complex phenomenon, its evaluation by binary responses (yes/no) is too simplistic. Thus, a scale is needed, which is capable of identifying the subtleties of topical corticosteroid phobia.Objectives:To develop and validate a scale, TOPICOP©, measuring worries and beliefs about topical corticosteroids among atopic dermatitis outpatients and their parents.Methods:An initial statistical validation of TOPICOP was carried out, collecting qualitative data about patients' topical corticophobia behaviors and beliefs using focus-group methodology. Then, 208 outpatients or their parents from five French centers completed a self-administered questionnaire built from focus-group results. The scale-development process comprised an explanatory principal component analysis, Cronbach's α-coefficients and structural equation modeling.Results:The validated questionnaire comprised 12 items, covering two important dimensions relative to ""worries"" (6 items) and ""beliefs"" (6 items). Psychometric properties showed that items had very good communality (>0.60) within their own dimension. The final two-factor solution accounted for 47.3% of the variance. Cronbach's α-coefficients were, respectively, 0.79 and 0.78. Structural equation modeling strongly supported the possibility of calculating a global score.Conclusions:TOPICOP© is the first scale aimed at assessing topical corticophobia in adult patients and parents of children with eczema. TOPICOP® has excellent psychometric properties and should be easy to use in everyday clinical practice for clinicians and researchers. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and validate TOPICOP© in other cultures. © 2013 Moret et al.",,"corticosteroid; adult; article; atopic dermatitis; Cronbach alpha coefficient; human; major clinical study; multicenter study; patient assessment; patient attitude; phobia; principal component analysis; psychometry; rating scale; structural equation modeling; topical corticophobia; topical corticophobia scale; validation study; Administration, Topical; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Child; Culture; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Linear Models; Outpatients; Parents; Phobic Disorders; Principal Component Analysis; Psychometrics",,,,,,,,,,"Williams, H.C., Burney, P.G., Pembroke, A.C., Hay, R.J., The U.K. Working Party's Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Dermatitis.

Our data come from patients who underwent Phadiatop test examinations in the University Hospital of Ostrava, the Clinic of Occupation and Preventive Medicine. Two databases were available for the research giving the records about family and personal anamnesis of each patient. These anamnesis were selected and appropriately rated as predictive variables for discriminant analysis. These data were obtained by an evaluation of the atopy score. Moreover, both of these anamnesis were divided into four categories according to the severity ranked by the doctors (asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema and others). Logistic regression with independent variables was used for the personal anamnesis in the older database. The model was tested using a medical database of 1027 clients in the first case and 1132 clients in the second case. In the newer database, complete family and personal anamnesis were used. The developed model predicts the results of the Phadiatop test with 75% probability dividing the patients into one of two groups and with 64% probability dividing the patients into five groups, which may represent significant financial savings for the diagnosis of atopy. © 2013 IEEE.","logistic regression; medical data; ordinal regression; Phadiatop Test","Allergic rhinitis; Financial savings; Independent variables; Logistic regressions; Medical data; Ordinal regression; Predictive variables; Preventive medicines; Database systems; Diagnosis; Discriminant analysis; Medical computing; Testing; Regression analysis",,,,,,,,,,"Kuráová, P., Hajduková, Z., Praks, P., (2010) Logistic Regression As A Tool for Athopy Investigation, Mendel-16th Conference on Soft Computing, pp. 187-190. , Brno; Kuráová, P., The processing of the medical data with use of logistic regression, Reliability & Risk Analysis: Theory & Applications (R&RATA) (2012) Journal of International Group on Realiability, pp. 65-72. , 0124; Hajduková, Z., Vantuchová, Y., Klimková, P., Makhoul, M., Hromádka, R., Atopy in patiens with allergic contact dermatitis (2009) Jurnal of Czech Physicians: Occupational Therapy, No.2, pp. 69-73. , http://www.prolekare.cz/casopis-lekaru-ceskych-clanek?id=5780, In Czech; Hajduková, Z., Pólováv Kosek, J., The importance of atopy investigation in the department of travel medicine (2005) Allergies: Magazine for Continuous Education in Allergy and Clinical Immunology, No.2, pp. 106-109. , http://www.tigis.cz/alergie/alergie_2_2005/obsah_f.htm, In Czech; Hosmer, D.W., Lemeshow, S., (2000) Applied Logistic Regression, , New York: Wiley-Interscience; Rabasová, M., Briš, R., Kuráová, P., Modified logistic regression as a tool for discrimination (2010) Reliability, Risk, and Safety: Theory and Applications, 3, pp. 1967-1972. , R.

We still lack a consensus about which HRQoL instrument to use as the standard, and how to measure the extent and severity of hand eczema. Objectives To compare the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) with EQ-5D (a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome), and to evaluate how the Hand Eczema Extent Score (HEES) relates to these instruments. Methods Ninety-three patients (61 females) were included. The HEES was recorded by a dermatologist, and the DLQI and EQ-5D by the patients. The results were analysed with factor analysis and non-parametric statistics. Results The DLQI and EQ-5D showed decreased HRQoL. Using factor analysis, we could not establish an association between the DLQI and EQ-5D. There were, however, correlations between the DLQI and the HEES (0.31), the EQindex and the HEES (- 0.32), the DLQI and the EQVAS (- 0.62), and the DLQI and the EQindex (- 0.67) (the EQVAS and the EQindex are calculated from EQ-5D). Conclusions We could not link factors in the DLQI to EQ-5D, which has previously been done for SF-36 (Short Form 36). On the basis of this, we cannot recommend EQ-5D over SF-36 for hand eczema studies. The DLQI correlates with the EQVAS and the EQindex, and can probably be used as an approximation for EQ-5D. Our findings with the HEES are interesting, as it can be used by patients. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

We aimed to identify phenotypes based upon the time course of respiratory/allergic symptoms throughout preschool years. Methods As part of the PARIS cohort, symptoms of wheezing, dry night cough, rhinitis and dermatitis were collected annually from birth to age 4 years. K-means clustering was used to group into phenotypes children with similar symptoms trajectories over the study period. Associations of phenotypes with IgE sensitization and risk factors were studied using multinomial logistic regression. Results Besides a group with low prevalence of symptoms considered as reference (n = 1236, 49.0%), four distinct respiratory/allergic phenotypes were identified: two transient [transient rhinitis phenotype (n = 295, 11.7%), transient wheeze phenotype (n = 399, 15.8%)], without any relation with IgE sensitization, and two persistent [cough/rhinitis phenotype (n = 284, 11.3%), dermatitis phenotype (n = 308, 12.2%)], associated with IgE sensitization. Transient rhinitis phenotype was only associated with tobacco smoke exposure, which could irritate the airways. Transient wheeze phenotype was related to male sex and contact with other children (older siblings, day care attendance). Lastly, risk factors for both IgE-associated phenotypes encompassed parental history of allergy, potential exposure to allergens and stress, known to be associated with the development of allergic diseases. Conclusion This study provides evidence for the existence of different respiratory/allergic phenotypes before school age. The fact that they differ in terms of sensitization and risk factors reinforces the plausibility of distinct phenotypes, potentially linked to irritation and infections for the transient phenotypes and to allergy for the persistent phenotypes. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, this heterogeneity is not well characterized. Objective: Our aim was to define longitudinal phenotypes of atopy between ages 1.5 and 8 years, and to assess the relationship of the atopy phenotypes to the risk of asthma, eczema and rhinitis at 8 years of age. Methods: We used latent class analysis (LCA) to define atopy phenotypes using data from skin prick tests that were performed at 1.5, 3, 5 and 8 years in participants in the Childhood Asthma Prevention Study (CAPS). Results: Four phenotypes were defined: late mixed inhalant sensitization; mixed food and inhalant sensitization; house dust mite (HDM) monosensitized; and no atopy. All three atopic phenotypes were associated with asthma, eczema and rhinitis, but the strongest association, particularly for asthma, was with the mixed food and inhalant sensitization phenotype. Conclusion & clinical relevance: We have used a LCA model to define atopy phenotypes empirically. The finding of a strong association between the mixed food and inhalant sensitization class and the presence of asthma and poor asthma control at age 8 years implies that food sensitization in early life may be of greater significance for subsequent risk of asthma than previously thought. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Asthma; Atopy; Children; Latent class analysis; Sensitization; Skin prick test","food allergen; house dust allergen; allergic disease; article; asthma; atopy; child; clinical study; disease association; eczema; grass; human; infant; peanut allergy; phenotype; preschool child; prevalence; prick test; priority journal; rhinitis; risk assessment; school child; sensitivity analysis; sensitization; Allergens; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Hypersensitivity, Immediate; Infant; Male; Phenotype; Skin Tests",,"Allergens",,,,,,,,"Arshad, S.H., Tariq, S.M., Matthews, S., Hakim, E., Sensitization to common allergens and its association with allergic disorders at age 4 years: a whole population birth cohort study (2001) Pediatrics, 108, pp. e33; Illi, S., von Mutius, E., Lau, S., Nickel, R., Niggemann, B., Sommerfeld, C., Wahn, U., The pattern of atopic sensitization is associated with the development of asthma in childhood (2001) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 108, pp. 709-714; Rhodes, H.L., Sporik, R., Thomas, P., Holgate, S.T., Cogswell, J.J., Early life risk factors for adult asthma: a birth cohort study of subjects at risk (2001) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 108, pp. 720-725; Kjaer, H.F., Eller, E., Andersen, K.E., Host, A., Bindslev-Jensen, C., The association between early sensitization patterns and subsequent allergic disease.

METHODS: In a randomized, open-label study, postmenopausal women received 60 mg denosumab sub-cutaneously every 6 months (n=417) or 150 mg ibandronate orally every month (n=416) for 12 months. End points included percentage change from baseline in total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine BMD at month 12 and percentage change from baseline in serum C-telopeptide at months 1 and 6 in a substudy. RESULTS: At month 12, significantly greater BMD gains from baseline were observed with denosumab compared with ibandronate at the total hip (2.3% compared with 1.1%), femoral neck (1.7% compared with 0.7%), and lumbar spine (4.1% compared with 2.0%; treatment difference P<.001 at all sites). At month 1, median change in serum C-telopeptide from baseline was 281.1% with denosumab and -35.0% with ibandronate (P<.001); the treatment difference remained significant at month 6 (P<.001). Adverse events occurred in 245 (59.6%) denosumab-treated women and 230 (56.1%) ibandronate-treated women (P=.635). The incidence of serious adverse events was 9.5% for denosumab-treated women and 5.4% for ibandronate-treated women (P=.046). No clustering of events in any organ system accounted for the preponderance of these reports. The incidence rates of serious adverse events involving infection and malignancy were similar between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: In postmenopausal women previously treated with a bisphosphonate and low BMD, denosumab treatment resulted in greater BMD increases than ibandronate at all measured sites. No new safety risks with denosumab treatment were identified. © 2013 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",,"bisphosphonic acid derivative; carboxy terminal telopeptide; denosumab; ibandronic acid; acute pancreatitis; adult; aged; bone density; conference paper; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug hypersensitivity; drug safety; eczema; female; femur fracture; femur neck; fracture nonunion; gastrointestinal disease; heart disease; hip; human; hypocalcemia; infection; jaw osteonecrosis; lumbar spine; open study; postmenopause; priority journal; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; respiratory tract disease; vascular disease",,"denosumab, 615258-40-7; ibandronic acid, 114084-78-5, 138844-81-2, 138926-19-9",,,,,,,,"NIH Consensus Development Panel on Osteoporosis Prevention, Diagnosis, and Therapy.

In this study a new method for asthma outcome prediction, which is based on Principal Component Analysis and Least Square Support Vector Machine Classifier, is presented. Most of the asthma cases appear during the first years of life. Thus, the early identification of young children being at high risk of developing persistent symptoms of the disease throughout childhood is an important public health priority. Methods. The proposed intelligent system consists of three stages. At the first stage, Principal Component Analysis is used for feature extraction and dimension reduction. At the second stage, the pattern classification is achieved by using Least Square Support Vector Machine Classifier. Finally, at the third stage the performance evaluation of the system is estimated by using classification accuracy and 10-fold cross-validation. Results. The proposed prediction system can be used in asthma outcome prediction with 95.54 % success as shown in the experimental results. Conclusions. This study indicates that the proposed system is a potentially useful decision support tool for predicting asthma outcome and that some risk factors enhance its predictive ability. © 2013 E.

Our first analyses in infants from the Pollution and Asthma Risk: an Infant Study (PARIS) birth cohort suggested that dry night cough was associated with parental-reported allergic disorders. The aim of the present study was to refine this finding by investigating the time course of dry night cough from birth to age 4 yr in relation to blood markers of atopy and allergic morbidity. Methods: Health outcomes were regularly assessed by parental self-administered questionnaires. Blood markers of atopy were measured at age 18 months. Children with similar patterns of dry night cough over the first 4 yr of life were grouped together using k-means clustering. Associations with atopy/allergy were studied using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Three trajectories of dry night cough were identified in 1869 children. Besides the never/infrequent pattern (72.4%), the transient pattern (8.8%) was composed of children who coughed in the first year and recovered by age 4 yr, while the rising pattern (18.8%) included all symptomatic children at age 4 yr, whether they were persistent or late coughers. Compared with the never/infrequent pattern, the rising pattern was significantly associated with elevated total immunoglobulin E (IgE) level (odds ratio [OR] = 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21-2.39) and inhalant allergens sensitization (OR = 2.66, 95% CI = 1.26-5.61) at age 18 months, and with doctor-diagnosed allergic diseases over the first 4 yr such as hay fever (OR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.49-4.26) and eczema (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.00-1.66). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that persistent/late dry night cough may indicate allergy in preschool children. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Allergy; Cluster analysis; Cohort study; Cough; Preschool children; Symptom trajectory","biological marker; immunoglobulin E; allergy; article; atopy; birth; child; childhood disease; cohort analysis; coughing; disease association; disease marker; dry night cough; female; human; major clinical study; male; morbidity; outcome assessment; patient assessment; preschool child; priority journal; questionnaire; sensitization; Age Factors; Biological Markers; Child, Preschool; Circadian Rhythm; Cluster Analysis; Cough; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunoglobulin E; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Male; Odds Ratio; Paris; Prevalence; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Time Factors",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Biological Markers; Immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,,"Brodlie, M., Graham, C., McKean, M.C., Childhood cough (2012) BMJ, 344, pp. e1177; Chang, A.B., Glomb, W.B., Guidelines for evaluating chronic cough in pediatrics: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2006) Chest, 129, pp. 260S-283S; Shields, M.D., Bush, A., Everard, M.L., McKenzie, S., Primhak, R., BTS guidelines: recommendations for the assessment and management of cough in children (2008) Thorax, 63, pp. iii1-15; Gibson, P.G., Chang, A.B., Glasgow, N.J., CICADA: cough in children and adults: diagnosis and assessment.

Objective: To determine childhood asthma phenotypes based on respiratory symptoms from a widely used questionnaire to further classify phenotypes in international settings. Methods: Between 2000 and 2002 cross-sectional studies were performed in four centres in Spain. Parental questionnaires were used to collect information on allergic diseases in more than 4000 children aged 8-12 years. In addition, objective markers for allergic sensitization and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) were measured. Latent class analyses (LCA) were applied to identify subgroups of children according to respiratory symptoms, and then the association of these groups with relevant clinical features such as concomitant allergic disease symptoms, atopy and BHR was studied. Results: We found seven classes, one corresponding to healthy children, three classes related to wheeze and three other classes mainly related to congestion and coughed-up phlegm. These tentative phenotypes differed in severity of symptoms and also in clinical correlates such as BHR and allergic sensitization. Atopy was more predominant in the 'wheeze phenotypes' whereas concomitant 'allergic' symptoms were most frequent in two of the 'wheeze phenotypes' and one of the 'cough phenotypes'. Conclusions: LCA on reported symptoms in a cross-sectional survey allowed different subgroups with meaningful clinical correlates to be defined. It remains to be investigated to what extent these groups also have different aetiologies, prognoses and therapeutic needs. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Asthma; Children; Latent class analysis; Phenotypes","allergic asthma; allergic sensitization; article; asthma; atopy; bronchial hyperresponsiveness; child; clinical feature; common cold; controlled study; coughing; cross-sectional study; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease association; disease severity; dyspnea; eczema; female; human; latent class analysis; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; nose obstruction; phenotype; priority journal; questionnaire; respiratory tract allergy; respiratory tract disease; rhinitis; school child; sensitivity and specificity; sensitization; Spain; statistical analysis; symptom; wheezing; Anti-Asthmatic Agents; Asthma; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Phenotype; Questionnaires; Respiratory Sounds; Risk Factors; Spain",,"Anti-Asthmatic Agents",,,,,,,,"Henderson, J., Granell, R., Heron, J., Associations of wheezing phenotypes in the first 6 years of life with atopy, lung function and airway responsiveness in mid-childhood (2008) Thorax, 63, pp. 974-980; Koopman, L.P., Brunekreef, B., de Jongste, J.C., Neijens, H.J., Definition of respiratory symptoms and disease in early childhood in large prospective birth cohort studies that predict the development of asthma (2001) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 12, pp. 118-124; Wenzel, S.E., Asthma phenotypes: the evolution from clinical to molecular approaches (2012) Nat Med, 18, pp. 716-725; Castro-Rodriguez, J.A., Garcia-Marcos, L., Wheezing and Asthma in childhood: an epidemiology approach (2008) Allergol Immunopathol, 36, pp. 280-290; Spycher, B.D., Silverman, M., Kuehni, C.E., Phenotypes of childhood asthma: are they real?

A total of 314 subjects were analyzed in this subanalysis, 282 of whom were eligible for evaluation of the relationship between LDL-C and carotid mean-IMT change. In the subanalysis, we evaluated the extent to which intensive lipid-lowering therapy slowed the mean-IMT progression by a correlation analysis between LDL-C and mean-IMT change after 12 months of statin treatment. Nearly half were male (49.4%) and elderly (49.7%). The majority (84.4%) were treated for primary prevention. Patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus accounted for 65.3% and 44.0%, respectively. At the 12-month measurement point, mean-IMT change was correlated with LDL-C (R = 0.187; P = 0.0016), LDL-C/ HDL-C ratio (R = 0.152; P = 0.0105), and non-HDL-C (R = 0.132; P = 0.0259). Mean-IMT after 12 months was divided into 4 subgroups by LDL-C at 12 months; < 80, ≥ 80 to < 100, ≥ 100 to < 120, and ≥ 120 mg/dL. A trend analysis using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test showed statistical significance (P = 0.0002). Even for prevention in Japanese patients who have lower risk of atherosclerotic disease than Western patients, lowering the LDL-C level to below the therapeutic target prevented mean-IMT progression after 12 months more strongly. These fi ndings suggest that more intensive control of LDL-C to levels lower than those in current JAS guidelines should be required to achieve slowing of progression as well as induction of regression of atherosclerosis.","Carotid intima-media thickness;

It has been observed that the color channel 'H' of HSI; followed by 'a' of CIELab; gives better segmentation results. © 2013 IEEE.","Color models; Eczema skin lesions; Image analysis; Segmentation","Color; Color codes; Image analysis; Image segmentation; Sustainable development; Atopic dermatitis; Color channels; Color models; K-means clustering; Segmentation results; Skin lesion; Subjective assessments; Visual inspection; Dermatology",,,,,,,,,,"Carroll, C.L., Balkrishnan, R., Feldman, S.R., Fleischer Jr., A.B., Manuel, J.C., The burden of atopic dermatitis: Impact on the patient, family, and society (2005) Pediatr Dermatol, 22, pp. 192-199; Tremp, M., Knafla, I., Burg, G., Wüthrich, B., Schmid-Grendelmeier, E., 'EASldig'-A digital tool to document disease activity in atopic dermatitis (2011) Dermatology, 223 (1), pp. 68-73; Barbier, N., Paul, C., Luger, T., Validation of the eczema area and severity index for atopic dermatitis in a cohort of 1550 patients from the pimecrolimus cream 1 % randomized controlled clinical trials programme (2004) Br J DemlatoI, 150, pp. 96-102; Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis: The SCORAD index (consensus report of the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis) (1993) Dermatology, I (S6), pp. 23-31. , European Task Force on Atopic Demlatitis; Oranje, A.P., Glazenburg, E.J., Wolkerstorfer, A., De Waard-Van-Der Spek, F.B., Practical issues on interpretation of scoring atopic dermatitis: The SCORAD index, objective SCORAD and the three-item severity score (2007) British Journal of Dermatology, 157, pp. 645-648; Nisar, H., Voon, Y.V., Visual measurment of erythema in atopic eczema (2011) Australasian Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine, , Dec; Ann, O., Nisar, H., Tang, J., Yeap, K., Yap, V., Automated measurement of erythema in atopic eczema (2012) Journal of Investigative Dermatology, 132 (SUPPL. 2). , Nature Publishing Group; Cheng, H.D., Jiang, X.H., Sun, Y., Color image segmentation: Advances & prospects (2001) Pattern Recognition, 34, pp. 2259-2281; Selvakumar, J., Lakshmi, A., Arivoli, T., Brain tumor segmentation and its area calculation in brain MR images using K-mean clustering and fuzzy cmean algorithm (2012) 2012 International Conference on Advances in Engineering, Science and Management, pp. 186-190; Bezdek, J.C., Hathaway, R.J., Sabin, M.J., Tucker, W.T., (1987) Convergence Theory for Fuzzy C-means: Counterexamples and Repairs, pp. 560-570; Song, M., Zhang, L., Comparison of cluster representations from partial second-to full fourth-order cross moments for data stream clustering (2008) Eighth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ICDM 2008, pp. 560-569; Sayadi, M., Tlig, L., Fnaiech, F., A new texture method based on fuzzy c-mean algorithm and statistical features (2007) Applied Mathematical Sciences, 60 (1), pp. 2999-3007; Gonzalez, R.C., Woods, R.E., (2010) Digital Image Processing, pp. 455-456. , Third Edition",,,"","IEEE Computer Society","2013 IEEE International Conference on Circuits and Systems: ""Advanced Circuits and Systems for Sustainability"", ICCAS 2013","18 September 2013 through 19 September 2013","Kuala Lumpur",102360,,9781479913374,,,"English","ICCAS - IEEE Int.

We sought to determine the impact of specific climatic factors on the prevalence of AD in the United states. We used a merged analysis of the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) from a representative sample of 91,642 children aged 0-17 years and the 2006-2007 National Climate Data Center and Weather Service measurements of relative humidity (%), indoor heating degree days (HDD), clear-sky UV indices, ozone levels, and outdoor air temperature. As a proxy for AD, we used an affirmative response to the NSCH survey question asking whether the participant's child has been given a doctor diagnosis of ""eczema or any other kind of skin allergy"" in the previous 12 months. In multivariate models controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, age, and household income, eczema prevalence was significantly lower with the highest-quartile mean annual relative humidity (logistic regression, adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=0.82 (0.71-0.96), P=0.01) and issued UV index (0.73 (0.64-0.84), P<0.0001), and with two other factors associated with increased UV exposure. Eczema prevalence was decreased with the highest-quartile air temperature (0.80 (0.70-0.92), P=0.002) but increased with third-quartile mean annual HDD (1.26 (1.11-1.43), P=0.0003).

Because natural killer T (NKT) cells have been implicated in these diseases, we asked if these cells were affected by DOCK8 deficiency. Using a mouse model, we found that DOCK8 deficiency resulted in impaired NKT cell development, principally affecting the formation and survival of long-lived, differentiated NKT cells. In the thymus, DOCK8-deficient mice lack a terminally differentiated subset of NK1.1+ NKT cells expressing the integrin CD103, whereas in the liver, DOCK8-deficient NKT cells express reduced levels of the prosurvival factor B-cell lymphoma 2 and the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1. Although the initial NKT cell response to antigen is intact in the absence of DOCK8, their ongoing proliferative and cytokine responses are impaired. Importantly, a similar defect in NKT cell numbers was detected in DOCK8-deficient humans, highlighting the relevance of the mouse model. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that DOCK8 is required for the development and survival of mature NKT cells, consistent with the idea that DOCK8 mediates survival signals within a specialized niche. Accordingly, impaired NKT cell numbers and function are likely to contribute to the susceptibility of DOCK8-deficient patients to recurrent infections and malignant disease.

Objective To determine if the novel phenotypes - mild early viral wheeze (EVW), atopic multiple-trigger wheeze (MTW), and nonatopic uncontrolled wheeze (NAUW) - have different courses during the preschool period. Methods Part of the prospectively followed Trousseau Asthma Program cohort was phenotyped using cluster analysis with 12 parameters (sex, asthma severity and control with inhaled corticosteroid [ICS], parental asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, food allergy, EVW or MTW, and allergen exposure trigger). Wheezing trajectories were assessed by crossing the original phenotypes with the phenotypes obtained at 5 years. Results Four clusters were identified at 5 years of age: asymptomatic children (n = 47) with no wheezing (98%), children with mild EVW (n = 40, 87% with EVW, 50% with EVW controlled with low-dose ICS), those with atopic MTW (n = 30, 100% with MTW, only 17% with MTW controlled with low-dose ICS, more significant for pollen asthmatic trigger), and those with atopic severe UW (n = 33, 63% with UW uncontrolled despite high doses of ICS, more significant for allergic rhinitis and dust as asthmatic trigger). Those with mild EVW became asymptomatic or remained with mild EVW. Those with atopic MTW remained with atopic MTW and those with NAUW developed severe UW in most cases. Conclusion These results show that remission is most frequently observed in mild EVW and that no remission is observed in atopic MTW. © 2013 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Methods In this cluster-randomised, double-blind trial, children aged younger than 19 months received PHiD-CV10 in 52 clusters or hepatitis vaccines as control in 26 clusters. Infants aged younger than 7 months at the first vaccination received either a 3+1 or a 2+1 vaccination schedule, children aged 7-11 months received a 2+1 schedule, and those 12-18 months of age received a two-dose schedule. The primary and secondary objectives were to assess vaccine effectiveness against culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease due to any of the ten vaccine serotypes for the 3+1 and 2+1 schedules, respectively, in children who received at least one PHiD-CV10 dose before 7 months of age. Masked follow-up of pneumococcal disease lasted from the first vaccination (from February, 2009, to October, 2010) to January 31, 2012. Invasive disease data were retrieved from data accumulated in the national infectious diseases register. This trial and the nested acute otitis media trial are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00861380 and NCT00839254, respectively. Findings 47 369 children were enrolled from February, 2009, to October, 2010. 30 528 participants were assessed for the primary objective. 13 culture-confirmed vaccine-type cases of invasive pneumococcal disease were detected: none in the PHiD-CV10 3+1 group, one in the PHiD-CV10 2+1 group, and 12 in the control groups. The estimates for vaccine effectiveness were 100% (95% CI 83-100) for PHiD-CV10 3+1 and 92% (58-100) for PHiD-CV10 2+1 groups. Two cases of any culture-confirmed invasive disease irrespective of serotype were detected in combined PHiD-CV10 infant cohorts compared with 14 in the corresponding control cohorts (vaccine effectiveness 93%, 75-99). In catch-up cohorts, seven cases of invasive disease were reported, all in the control group: two cases in the children enrolled at 7-11 months of age; and five cases in children enrolled at 12-18 months of age (vaccine effectiveness 100%, 79-100). Non-fatal serious adverse events suspected to be vaccine-related were reported via routine post-immunisation safety surveillance in 18 children. Interpretation This nationwide trial showed high PHiD-CV10 effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease when given in different schedules. For the first time, effectiveness of a 2+1 schedule in infants was confirmed in a clinical trial.",,"hepatitis A vaccine; PHiD CV10 vaccine; Pneumococcus vaccine; recombinant hepatitis B vaccine; unclassified drug; article; asphyxia; bacterium culture; child; clinical assessment; cluster analysis; controlled study; cystitis; diarrhea; disease surveillance; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug safety; eczema; Enterovirus infection; febrile convulsion; female; fever; follow up; groups by age; hepatitis A; human; infant; irritability; major clinical study; male; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; multicenter study; muscle hypotonia; myocarditis; outcome assessment; parotitis; pneumococcal infection; preschool child; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; serotype; side effect; sudden infant death syndrome; tonsillitis; vaccination",,,"engerix b, Glaxo SmithKline; prevenar, Pfizer, United States; prevnar, Pfizer, United States; synflorix, Glaxo SmithKline, Belgium","Glaxo SmithKline, Belgium; Glaxo SmithKline; Pfizer, United States","GlaxoSmithKline, GSK

The prevalence of allergic disease is increasing in Korea, but the relationship between allergic symptoms and stress is not empirically well known. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between allergy-related symptoms and stress in children and adolescents. Methods: We investigated 698 children and adolescents living in Gwangyang Bay, Korea, using a multi-stage cluster sampling method. Using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood and the Psychosocial Well-being Index, these subjects were surveyed on allergy-related symptoms and psychosocial stressors in their lives, respectively. We used a multivariate logistic analysis for odds ratios for the complaint rate of allergic symptoms, after adjusting for age, gender, household income, body mass index, and residence. Results: After adjustments, lifetime rhinitis (odds ratio [OR], 1.024), rhinoconjunctivitis (OR, 1.090), diagnosis of itchy eczema (OR, 1.040), treatment of itchy eczema (OR, 1.049), 12-month allergic conjunctivitis (OR, 1.026), diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis (OR, 1.031), and treatment of allergic conjunctivitis (OR, 1.034) were found to be signifcantly associated with stress. Conclusions: Our results support the notion that there is a relationship between stress and allergic symptoms in children and adolescents. Further research into any causal relationship between stress and allergies, as well as preventative public health plans for decreasing stress in children and adolescents are needed.

Although dermatology data were not used in its development, the use of the EQ-5D questionnaire has been encouraged by the requirement of health technology assessment agencies for utility comparisons informing reimbursement decisions. The aim of this review was to examine the use of the EQ-5D in dermatology and to consider its future role in the economic evaluation of skin diseases. Published studies reporting the use of the EQ-5D in the economic analysis of skin diseases were carefully examined. Nineteen articles and 1 abstract published between 2003 and 2011 were identified, in which cost-of-illness, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were described. The EQ-5D is not a dermatology-specific measure, and it is not yet clear whether it is the most appropriate measure to support economic evaluation in the context of dermatology. Copyright © 2012 S.

It was first introduced during the last quarter of 2010 in three West African countries. We report on the monitoring of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in Burkina Faso where more than 11 million people aged 1-29. years were vaccinated. Vaccine pharmacovigilance relied on stimulated passive AEFI surveillance countrywide and active surveillance for 12 clinical conditions in one sentinel district (Ziniaré) with 97,715 people eligible for vaccination. All AEFI occurring during the 10. days of mass campaign or the 42 subsequent days were to be notified. Serious AEFI were submitted to a national expert committee (NEC) for causality assessment. A total of 11,466,950 people were vaccinated with 1471 vaccinees reported to have experienced at least one AEFI (12.83 cases per 100,000). 1444 AEFI were minor; the most common of which were fever, headache, gastro-intestinal disorders and local reactions (2-7 cases per 100,000). Of 27 serious AEFI reported, four cases were classified by the NEC as related to vaccine (1 case per 3 million vaccinated) including one case each of exanthematous pustulosis, angioedema, bronchospasm and severe vomiting. Active surveillance identified 71 cases of the 12 conditions of interest. Convulsions, urticaria and bronchospasm were more frequently reported. Attack rates for those conditions were similar to the baseline rates recorded in the same population, over the same time period, a year earlier. With the exception of convulsions in the days following vaccination the distribution of time intervals between vaccination and the occurrence of symptoms did not reveal any temporal clustering. The monitoring of AEFI of MenAfriVac™ in Burkina Faso did not suggest special concern regarding the vaccine safety. However, reported possible hypersensitivity reactions to vaccine components would require further review to rule out any anaphylactic reaction. © 2011.","AEFI; Africa; MenAfriVac; Monitoring; Pharmacovigilance; Safety; Vaccine","Meningococcus vaccine; abscess; acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis; adolescent; adult; angioneurotic edema; arthralgia; article; asthenia; bronchospasm; child; convulsion; crying; dizziness; drug monitoring; drug surveillance program; eczema; female; fever; gastrointestinal disease; headache; human; infant; lethargy; local skin reaction; lymphadenopathy; male; mass immunization; myalgia; Neisseria meningitidis; nodule; passive immunization; preschool child; priority journal; pruritus; rash; scalp pruritus; school child; side effect; sleeping disorder; syncope; urticaria; vomiting; Adolescent; Adult; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Burkina Faso; Child; Child, Preschool; Drug Toxicity; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Mass Vaccination; Meningococcal Infections; Meningococcal Vaccines; Young Adult",,"MenAfriVac; Meningococcal Vaccines","menafrivac",,,,,,,"LaForce, F.M., Konde, K., Viviani, S., Préziosi, M.P., The Meningitis Vaccine Project (2007) Vaccine, 25 (SUPPL. 1), pp. A97-A100. , Epub 2007 May 7, September; Bishai, D.M., Champion, C., Steele, M.E., Thompson, L., Product development partnerships hit their stride: lessons from developing a meningitis vaccine for Africa (2011) Health Aff (Millwood), 30 (6), pp. 1058-1064. , June; Sow, S.O., Okoko, B.J., Diallo, A., Viviani, S., Borrow, R., Carlone, G., Immunogenicity and safety of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in Africans (2011) New Engl J Med, 364 (24), pp. 2293-2304. , June; Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, 3-4 December 2009 (2010) WER, 85 (5), pp. 31-32; Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, 16-17 June 2010 (2010) WER, 85 (30), pp. 285-292; Vogt, R.L., LaRue, D., Klaucke, D.N., Jillson, D.A., Comparison of an active and passive surveillance system of primary care providers for hepatitis, measles, rubella, and salmonellosis in Vermont (1983) Am J Public Health, 73 (7), pp. 795-797. , July; Ciofi Degli Atti, M.L., Salmaso, S., Bella, A., Arigliani, R., Gangemi, M., Chiamenti, G., Pediatric sentinel surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases in Italy (2002) Pediatr Infect Dis J, 21 (8), pp. 763-768. , August; Bentsi-Enchill, A.D., Zongo, I., Khamassi, S., Pless, R., Thombiano, R., Tiéndrebéogo, S., Monitoring of adverse events during the 2003 mass vaccination campaign with a trivalent meningococcal A/C/W135 polysaccharide vaccine in Burkina Faso (2007) Vaccine, 25 (SUPPL. 1), pp. A72-A78. , Epub 2007 May 7, September; Pöllabauer, E.M., Petermann, R., Ehrlich, H.J., Group C meningococcal polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine: a meta-analysis of immunogenicity, safety and posology (2005) Hum Vaccin, 1 (4), pp. 131-139. , Epub 2005 July 13, July-August; Destefano, F., Pfeifer, D., Nohynek, H., Safety profile of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines: systematic review of pre- and post-licensure data (2008) Bull World Health Organ, 86 (5), pp. 373-380. , May; Mark, A., Carlsson, R.M., Granstrom, M., Subcutaneous versus intramuscular injection for booster DT vaccination of adolescents (1999) Vaccine, 17 (15-16), pp. 2067-2072. , April; (2000) WHO Supplementary information on vaccine safety.

Objectives: To study parental atopic imprinting on the cytokines and chemokines in the upper airway mucosal lining fluid of healthy neonates. Methods: Eighteen cytokines and chemokineswere quantified in nasal mucosal lining fluid in 309 neonates from the novel unselected Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC) birth cohort. Measurements and Main Results:Maternal, but not paternal, atopic status (asthma, hay fever, or eczema with or without sensitization) was associated with general down-regulation of all 18 mediators assessed by principal component analysis (overall P = 0.015).

Objective: We investigated the respiratory and allergic phenotypes of children followed in the Pollution and Asthma Risk: An Infant Study (PARIS) birth cohort. Methods: Information on respiratory and allergic disorders, medical visits, and medications was collected during medical examinations of children at 18 months of age; biomarker data were also collected (total and allergen-specific IgE levels and eosinophilia). Phenotypes were determined by using latent class analysis. Associated risk factors were determined based on answers to questionnaires about environmental exposures. Results: Apart from a reference group, which had a low prevalence of respiratory symptoms or allergies (n = 1271 [69.4%]), 3 phenotypes were identified. On the basis of clinical signs of severity and use of health care resources, we identified a mild phenotype (n = 306 [16.7%]) characterized by occasional mild wheeze and 2 severe phenotypes separated by atopic status. The atopic severe phenotype (n = 59 [3.2%]) included 49 (83%) children with wheezing and was characterized by a high prevalence of atopy (61% with allergenic sensitization) and atopic dermatitis (78%). In contrast, atopy was rare among children with the nonatopic severe phenotype (n = 195 [11%]); this group included 88% of the children with recurrent wheezing. Risk factors for respiratory disease included parental history of asthma, male sex, siblings, day care attendance, exposure to tobacco smoke or molds, indoor renovations, and being overweight, although these factors did not have similar affects on risk for all phenotypes. Conclusion: Atopy should be taken into account when assessing the risk of severe exacerbations (that require hospital-based care) in wheezing infants; precautions should be taken against respiratory irritants and molds and to prevent children from becoming overweight. © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","Atopy; cluster analysis; infancy; phenotype; risk factors; severity; wheeze","food allergen; immunoglobulin E; tobacco smoke; allergic disease; allergic rhinitis; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; childhood obesity; clinical feature; cohort analysis; coughing; disease exacerbation; disease severity; eczema; environmental exposure; eosinophilia; family history; female; hospital care; human; infant; major clinical study; male; phenotype; population research; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; respiratory tract disease; risk factor; sex difference; sibling; wheezing",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,,"Pearce, N., Ait-Khaled, N., Beasley, R., Mallol, J., Keil, U., Mitchell, E., Worldwide trends in the prevalence of asthma symptoms: Phase III of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) (2007) Thorax, 62, pp. 758-766; Bousquet, J., Anto, J., Auffray, C., Akdis, M., Cambon-Thomsen, A., Keil, T., MeDALL (Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy): An integrated approach from phenotypes to systems medicine (2011) Allergy, 66, pp. 596-604; Stein, R.T., Holberg, C.J., Morgan, W.J., Wright, A.L., Lombardi, E., Taussig, L., Peak flow variability, methacholine responsiveness and atopy as markers for detecting different wheezing phenotypes in childhood (1997) Thorax, 52, pp. 946-952; Castro-Rodriguez, J.A., Holberg, C.J., Wright, A.L., Martinez, F.D., A clinical index to define risk of asthma in young children with recurrent wheezing (2000) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 162, pp. 1403-1406; Castro-Rodriguez, J.A., The Asthma Predictive Index: A very useful tool for predicting asthma in young children (2010) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 126, pp. 212-216; Brand, P.L., Baraldi, E., Bisgaard, H., Boner, A.L., Castro-Rodriguez, J.A., Custovic, A., Definition, assessment and treatment of wheezing disorders in preschool children: An evidence-based approach (2008) Eur Respir J, 32, pp. 1096-1110; (2009) Global Initiative for Asthma Report.

Objective: To identify phenotypes of severe recurrent wheezing and therapeutic approaches. Methods: We performed cluster analysis with 20 variables of 551 children with active asthma, younger than 36 months old, and enrolled in the Trousseau Asthma Program. Results: We identified 3 independent clusters of children with wheezing. Cluster 1, mild episodic viral wheeze (n = 327), consisted of children with wheezing related only to colds (71%), mild disease (76%), and mainly normal chest x-ray results. Cluster 2, nonatopic uncontrolled wheeze (n = 157), was characterized by moderate to severe disease (91%), uncontrolled wheezing despite high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (55%), parents with asthma, and increased levels of ferritine. Cluster 3, atopic multiple-trigger wheeze (n = 67), included more children with multiple-trigger wheeze (68%) than did clusters 1 or 2; eczema (75%); a positive result from the Phadiatop Infant test (90%); increased levels of IgE, IgA, and IgG; and abnormal results from chest x-rays. In separate analysis, 1 parameter for boys (increased total level of IgE) and 2 parameters for girls (wheezing severity and increased total level of IgE) properly classified 90% of boys and 83% of girls in the appropriate cluster. Significant associations were found between overcrowding, molds and cockroaches at home, and atopic multiple-trigger wheeze and between day-care attendance and nonatopic uncontrolled wheeze in other parts. Conclusion: We identified different phenotypes of recurrent wheezing in young children by using cluster analysis with usual variables. These phenotypes require confirmation in longer, follow-up studies. © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","allergy; ICS; preschool children; Risk factors","alpha 1 antitrypsin; ferritin; fluticasone; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin G; abnormal laboratory result; allergic rhinitis; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; classification; cluster analysis; cockroach; common cold; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; disease severity; drug megadose; female; follow up; food allergy; groups by age; home environment; human; immunoassay; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; mould; neutrophil; parent; patient compliance; Phadiatop Infant test; phenotype; preschool child; priority journal; random forest; recurrent disease; risk factor; sex difference; thorax radiography; treatment outcome; virus infection; wheezing",,"alpha 1 antitrypsin, 9041-92-3; ferritin, 9007-73-2; fluticasone, 90566-53-3; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9",,,,,,,,"Illi, S., Von Mutius, E., Lau, S., Niggemann, B., Gruber, C., Wahn, U., Perennial allergen sensitisation early in life and chronic asthma in children: A birth cohort study (2006) Lancet, 368 (9537), pp. 763-770. , DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69286-6, PII S0140673606692866; Martinez, F.D., Wright, A.L., Taussig, L.M., Holberg, C.J., Halonen, M., Morgan, W.J., Asthma and wheezing in the first six years of life.

This study aimed to translate the original English version of the Questionnaire to Chinese and to provide psychometric evidence on the validity and reliability of the translated version. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Out-patient clinic of a non-teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Participants The Paediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire was translated to Chinese and then completed by a group of 115 Hong Kong Chinese children (66 male and 49 female; mean age, 11 years) with allergic disease(s). All subjects were asked to respond using visual analogue scales dealing with issues related to the perceived morbidity of allergic diseases. To assess testretest reliability, 2 weeks later a subgroup of 16 individuals was retested with the same Questionnaire. Results The internal consistency of the Chinese Paediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire was satisfactory (Cronbach alpha=0.92). The correlation between the total Questionnaire score and the visual analogue scale score was moderately significant (Spearman's rho=0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.62). Structural validity as studied by confirmatory factor analysis found that the structure of subscales was remarkably similar to the original English version. The intra-class correlation between the Questionnaire score from the first and the second test in the subgroup of 16 subjects was 0.75, indicating adequate repeatability. Conclusion The validity and reliability of the Chinese version of the Paediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire was established for clinical use.","Allergic; Asthma; Child; Eczema; Perennial; Quality of life; Rhinitis","adolescent; age distribution; allergic disease; article; child; Chinese; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; Health Assessment Questionnaire; Hong Kong; human; internal consistency; linguistics; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; Pediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire; psychometry; quality of life; reliability; school child; sex difference; teaching hospital; test retest reliability; validity; visual analog scale; Adolescent; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Language; Male; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results",,,,,,,,,,"Lee, S.L., Wong, W., Lau, Y.L., Increasing prevalence of allergic rhinitis but not asthma among children in Hong Kong from 1995 to 2001 (Phase 3 International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) (2004) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 15, pp. 72-78; Baiardini, I., Braido, F., Brandi, S., Canonica, G.W., Allergic diseases and their impact on quality of life (2006) Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol, 97, pp. 419-428; Blazeby, J.M., Avery, K., Sprangers, M., Pikhart, H., Fayers, P., Donovan, J., Health-related quality of life measurement in randomized clinical trials in surgical oncology (2006) J Clin Oncol, 24, pp. 3178-3186; Quality of life questionnaires for all respiratory diseases, every language and ethnic minorities.

Aims: This prospective study examined the relationship between maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy and the risk of wheeze and eczema in the offspring aged 16-24months. Materials & Methods: Subjects were 763 mother-child pairs. Data on maternal intake during pregnancy were assessed with a diet history questionnaire. Dietary patterns were derived from factor analysis of 33 predefined food groups. Symptoms of wheeze and eczema were based on criteria of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. Adjustment was made for maternal age, gestation, residential municipality, family income, maternal and paternal education, maternal and paternal history of allergic disorders, changes in maternal diet in pregnancy, season at baseline, maternal smoking during pregnancy, baby's older siblings, sex, birth weight, age at the third survey, household smoking, and breastfeeding duration. Results: Three dietary patterns were identified: 'healthy', characterized by high intake of green and yellow vegetables, seaweed, mushrooms, white vegetables, pulses, potatoes, fish, sea products, fruit, and shellfish; 'Western', characterized by high intake of vegetable oil, salt-containing seasonings, beef and pork, processed meat, eggs, chicken, and white vegetables; and 'Japanese', characterized by high intake of rice, miso soup, sea products, and fish. There was a tendency for an inverse exposure-response relationship between the maternal Western pattern during pregnancy and the risk of childhood wheeze by crude analysis. After adjustment for the confounding factors under study, the inverse relationship was strengthened: the adjusted OR between extreme quartiles was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.35-0.98, p for trend=0.02). No such inverse association was observed for childhood eczema. Neither the maternal healthy pattern nor the Japanese pattern during pregnancy was related to childhood wheeze or eczema. Conclusion: The maternal Western pattern during pregnancy may be preventive against wheeze in the offspring. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Eczema; Japanese children; Maternal dietary patterns; Pregnancy;

Ninety-six children with allergic rhinitis, aged between 1 and 3 years old, referred to ENT department of Beijing Children's Hospital between August 2009 and November 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Data were recorded for patients' age, age stratification, sex, the age of first symptom, the duration of history, and the allergic history of children, the allergic history of parents. The screening tests on inhalant and food allergens were conducted by immunoblot assay using the Allergy Screen system. The total serum IgE level was also measured. The distribution of the inhalant and food allergens was summarized. The influence of the clinical characteristics was analyzed according to the age subgroup determined by month, allergen category and positiveness of eczema or asthma. Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship of clinical characteristics and allergen spectrum. The total positive rates of allergic screening test rate were 81.3%. The inhalant and food allergens were 62.5% and 53.1% respectively. The commonest allergy was mixed fungal (50.0%), followed by milk (34.4%), lamb (31.3%), beef (26.0%), dust mite (21.0%), wheat (18.8%), mugwort (12.5%), egg white or egg yolk (11.5%).62.5% of patients could be diagnosed as AR, the remaining could be diagnosed temporarily as non-allergic rhinitis temporarily. Single factor analysis of clinical characteristics in different subgroup determined by month showed that: inhalant allergen (positive/negative) (χ2=13.699, P=0.001), father suffered from AR (χ2=14.060, P=0.001), and father or mother suffered from AR (χ2=7.396, P=0.025) were statistically significant at three monthly age groups. The personal history of eczema (OR=3.143, P=0.034) might increase the possibility of sensitization to allergens. The personal history of eczema (OR=3.125, P=0.015) and the total serum IgE level>200 IU/ml (OR=3.119, P=0.030) might increase the possibility of sensitization to inhalant allergens. No clinical features for food allergen sensitization was statistically significant. There was no significant difference in positive rates between inhalant and food allergens groups. The presence of inhalant allergens (OR=3.594, P=0.046), insect bites dermatitis (OR=11.941, P=0.002) were the risk factors for positiveness of eczema or asthma, and the father with AR (OR=0.251, P=0.040) as protective factors. Inhalant and food allergens all can be sensitized in the children with AR symptoms between 1 to 3 years old, and the positive rate of inhalant group is slightly higher. The differences of the inhalant allergen (positive/negative) and father suffered from AR are statistically significant at three monthly age groups. The history of eczema is the risk factor for allergen screening positive. Serum total IgE>200 IU/ml and eczema history are risk factors for inhalant allergen screening positive. The factors of inhalant allergens, insect bites dermatitis and father suffered from AR relate to any positive of eczema or asthma.",,"allergen; article; female; human; immunology; infant; male; preschool child; retrospective study; rhinitis; Allergens; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Retrospective Studies; Rhinitis",,"Allergens",,,,,,,,,"Dai, W.L.",,,,,,,,16730860,,,"22335979","Chinese","Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860791074

There is little evidence that the EVW and MTW phenotypes are related to the longitudinal patterns of wheeze, or to different underlying pathological processes. As the clinical response to inhaled corticosteroids and montelukast varies considerably between individual children with EVW, and between individual patients with MTW, the clinical usefulness of the EVW-MTW approach is doubtful.Based on the currently available evidence, we propose to describe preschool wheeze symptoms not only in terms of temporal pattern, but also in terms of frequency and severity, and age of onset. Relevant associated clinical parameters like atopy and eczema should be described with recognition of age of onset, pattern, and severity. Comparing these data to biomarkers and histopathology may help to improve our understanding of preschool wheezing disorders in the future.Until phenotypes can be described that are associated with different pathobiological process, are related to different longitudinal outcomes, or are clearly different in terms of response to therapy, clinicians are encouraged to take a trial and error approach of different therapeutic agents in preschool children with troublesome recurrent wheeze. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Asthma; Classification; Episodic viral wheeze; Multiple trigger wheeze; Preschool; Wheeze","corticosteroid; atopy; clinical practice; disease classification; disease severity; eczema; environmental exposure; episodic viral wheeze; general practitioner; genetic variability; histopathology; hospitalization; human; low drug dose; lung function; multiple trigger wheeze; onset age; outcome assessment; phenotype; principal component analysis; priority journal; review; wheezing; Age of Onset; Child, Preschool; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Lung Diseases; Phenotype; Recurrence; Respiratory Function Tests; Respiratory Sounds; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index",,,,,,,,,,"Martinez, F.D., Wright, A.L., Taussig, L.M., Holberg, C.J., Halonen, M., Morgan, W.J., Asthma and wheezing in the first six years of life.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the anti-allergy effect of FU. FU extract (80 mg/kg), orally administered to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, significantly inhibited the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction. It inhibited the compound 48/80- induced release of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Significant inhibitory effects of the FU extract on IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-μ (1, 10, and 100μg/mL) were observed in HMC-1 cells.

Methods: We developed a microarray immunoassay containing 103 allergens to study the IgE reactivity profiles of 485 asthmatic and 342 non-asthmatic individuals belonging to families whose members have a documented history of asthma and atopy. We employed k-means clustering, to investigate whether a particular IgE reactivity profile correlated with asthma and other atopic conditions such as rhinitis, conjunctivitis and eczema. Results: Both case-control and parent-to-siblings analyses demonstrated that while the presence of specific IgE against individual allergens correlated poorly with pathological conditions, particular reactivity profiles were significantly associated with asthma (p<10E-09). An artificial neural network (ANN)-based algorithm, calibrated with the profile reactivity data, correctly classified as asthmatic or non-asthmatic 78% of the individual examined. Multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated that the familiar relationships of the study population did not affect the observed correlations. Conclusions: These findings indicate that asthma is a higher-order phenomenon related to patterns of IgE reactivity rather than to single antibody reactions. This notion sheds new light on the pathogenesis of the disease and can be readily employed to distinguish asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals on the basis of their serum reactivity profile. © 2011 Dottorini et al.",,"allergen; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin E; adolescent; adult; aged; article; artificial neural network; asthma; atopy; case control study; child; cohort analysis; conjunctivitis; controlled study; eczema; female; gene sequence; human; immunoglobulin blood level; immunoreactivity; major clinical study; male; nucleotide sequence; preschool child; rhinitis; school child; algorithm; blood; immunoassay; immunology; middle aged; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Allergens; Asthma; Child; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Immunoassay; Immunoglobulin E; Male; Middle Aged","GENBANK: GSE20020","immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Allergens; Immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,,"Fanta, C.H., Asthma (2009) N Engl J Med, 360, pp. 1002-1014; Jansson, S.A., Ronmark, E., Forsberg, B., Lofgren, C., Lindberg, A., The economic consequences of asthma among adults in Sweden (2007) Respir Med, 101, pp. 2263-2270; Seaton, A., Godden, D.J., Brown, K., Increase in asthma: A more toxic environment or a more susceptible population?

The aim of the present study was to identify distinct asthma phenotypes by applying latent class analysis (LCA), a model-based clustering method, to two large epidemiological studies. Adults with asthma who participated in the follow-up of the Epidemiological Study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA2) (n=641) and the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHSII) (n=1,895) were included. 19 variables covering personal characteristics, asthma symptoms, exacerbations and treatment, age of asthma onset, allergic characteristics, lung function and airway hyperresponsiveness were considered in the LCA. Four asthma phenotypes were distinguished by the LCA in each sample. Two phenotypes were similar in EGEA2 and ECRHSII: active treated allergic childhood-onset asthma and active treated adult-onset asthma. The other two phenotypes were composed of subjects with inactive or mild untreated asthma, who differed by atopy status and age of asthma onset (childhood or adulthood). The phenotypes clearly discriminated populations in terms of quality of life, and blood eosinophil and neutrophil counts. The LCAs revealed four distinct asthma phenotypes in each sample. Considering these more homogeneous phenotypes in future studies may lead to a better identification of risk factors for asthma.

Objective From a birth cohort of at risk infants (first-degree family with atopic disease), we evaluated the influence of distinct intrinsic immunologic risk factors on wheezing disorders in the first 2 years of life. Methods Cord blood samples were collected from 195 eligible subjects of a birth cohort of 253 subjects. The subjects studied were those who developed wheezing (n=34) or eczema (n=29) in the first 2 years of life, and 65 healthy control infants. At the time of thawing the viability of the cells were median 70% (range 67.5%-72.5%). Cytokines from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mononuclear cells were analysed using fluorescent-activated cell sorting-array and their profiles were evaluated using factor analysis. Results Infants with wheeze were significantly associated with enhanced combined LPS stimulated IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12/IL-23p40 compared with healthy controls (P=0.003). This profile was also associated with the increased risk for wheeze at 2 years of age (OR=2.45; 95% CI=1.50-3.93, P=0.001). LPS-stimulated cytokine IL-8 was also significantly higher in the wheeze group compared with healthy controls and eczema (P=0.003). Intracellular staining showed that monocytes are main producers of IL-6 and IL-8 from cord blood mononuclear cells. Most of the subjects were non-atopic with 3/34 (9%) wheeze and 9/29 (31%) eczema subjects sensitized to the common dietary or inhalant allergens. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance In infants at genetic risk of atopy, wheeze but not eczema in the first 2 years of life is associated with intrinsic hyperresponsive innate cytokine responses which might predispose infants to wheeze development. Distinct pre-symptomatic hyperresponsive innate immune responses risk factors were found to be associated with early onset wheeze disorders, but not eczema. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Cord blood mononuclear cells; Cytokines; Early onset wheeze; Infant eczema; Innate immunity","allergen; gamma interferon; house dust allergen; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 12p70; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 23; interleukin 23p40; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; lipopolysaccharide; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; allergic rhinitis; article; asthma; atopy; blood sampling; breast feeding; cell viability; child; controlled study; cytokine production; eczema; egg yolk; family history; female; fluorescence activated cell sorting; high risk infant; human; human cell; immunostimulation; infant; innate immunity; major clinical study; male; milk; monocyte; mononuclear cell; onset age; preschool child; priority journal; risk factor; sensitization; umbilical cord blood; wheezing; Age of Onset; Child, Preschool; Cytokines; Eczema; Female; Fetal Blood; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Interleukin-12; Interleukin-1beta; Interleukin-23; Interleukin-6; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Lipopolysaccharides; Male; Respiratory Sounds; Risk Factors",,"gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; interleukin 12, 138415-13-1; interleukin 2, 85898-30-2; interleukin 8, 114308-91-7; Cytokines; Interleukin-12, 187348-17-0; Interleukin-1beta; Interleukin-23; Interleukin-6; Lipopolysaccharides",,,,,,,,"Tregoning, J.S., Schwarze, J., Respiratory viral infections in infants (2010) causes, clinical symptoms, virology, and immunology, 23, pp. 74-98. , Clin Microbiol Rev; Ly, N.P., Gold, D.R., Weiss, S.T., Celedon, J.C., Recurrent wheeze in early childhood and asthma among children at risk for atopy (2006) Pediatrics, 117, pp. e1132-e1138; Martinez, F.D., Wright, A.L., Taussig, L.M., Holberg, C.J., Halonen, M., Morgan, W.J., Asthma and wheezing in the first six years of life.

Although relatively little is understood about its underlying mechanisms due to its complexity, skin barrier dysfunction has been recognised as a key factor in the development of AD. Skin barrier homeostasis requires tight control of the activity of proteases, called kallikreins (KLKs), whose activity is regulated by a complex network of protein interactions that remains poorly understood despite its pathological importance. Characteristic symptoms of AD include the outbreak of inflammation triggered by external (eg. mechanical and chemical) stimulus and the persistence and aggravation of inflammation even if the initial stimulus disappears. These characteristic symptoms, together with some experimental data, suggest the presence of positive feedback regulation for KLK activity by inflammatory signals. We developed simple mathematical models for the KLK activation system to study the effects of feedback loops and carried out bifurcation analysis to investigate the model behaviours corresponding to inflammation caused by external stimulus. The model analysis confirmed that the hypothesised core model mechanisms capture the essence of inflammation outbreak by a defective skin barrier. Our models predicted the outbreaks of inflammation at weaker stimulus and its longer persistence in AD patients compared to healthy control. We also proposed a novel quantitative indicator for inflammation level by applying principal component analysis to microarray data. The model analysis reproduced qualitative AD characteristics revealed by this indicator. Our results strongly implicate the presence and importance of feedback mechanisms in KLK activity regulation. We further proposed future experiments that may provide informative data to enhance the system-level understanding on the regulatory mechanisms of skin barrier in AD and healthy individuals. © 2011 Tanaka et al.",,"kallikrein; proteinase activated receptor 2; article; atopic dermatitis; feedback system; inflammation; mathematical model; permeability barrier; prediction; principal component analysis; protein degradation; quantitative analysis; receptor upregulation; regulatory mechanism; skin permeability; stimulus response; biological model; case control study; DNA microarray; feedback system; genetics; human; kinetics; metabolism; pathophysiology; skin; Case-Control Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Feedback, Physiological; Humans; Kallikreins; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Skin",,"kallikrein, 8006-48-2, 9001-01-8; Kallikreins, 3.4.21.-",,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/G007446/1",,,,,"Bieber, T., Atopic dermatitis (2010) Ann Dermatol, 22, pp. 125-137; Callard, R.E., Harper, J.I., The skin barrier, atopic dermatitis and allergy: a role for langerhans cells?

Data consisted of 3,453 Dutch Friesian broodmares with 3,763 visual observations on IBH clinical symptoms scored by 12 inspectors during organized foal inspections in 2004 and 2008. Nine percent of the mares (n = 310) were scored in both years. Mares descended from 144 sires and 2,554 dams and 26.2% of the dams (n = 669) had more than 1 offspring in the data set (range: 2 to 6). Insect bite hypersensitivity was analyzed as a binary trait with a threshold animal model with and without a maternal effect, using a Bayesian approach. Observed IBH prevalence in Dutch Friesian broodmare population was 18.2%. Heritability on the liability scale was 0.16 (SD = 0.06); heritability on the observed scale was 0.07; and repeatability was 0.89 (SD = 0.03). Maternal effect was 0.17 (SD = 0.06) and significantly differed from zero, although the animal model without a maternal effect fitted the data better. These results show that genetic and permanent environmental factors affect IBH in Dutch Friesian horses. The dam affected the IBH development of her offspring through an additive genetic influence but also by being part of their rearing environment. © 2011 American Society of Animal Science.

However, their role in allergic disease is unclear. Allergic diseases are immunologically heterogeneous, and we hypothesized that n-3 fatty acid composition in serum and breast milk may vary according to clinical manifestations. Further, animal studies have shown reduction of serum-PUFA levels during allergic inflammation. Objective To investigate fatty acid composition in breast milk and serum from women with different atopic disease manifestations. Secondly, to determine whether low PUFA levels reflected insufficient intakes. Methods Fatty acids were analysed in breast milk and serum of women with atopic eczema and respiratory allergy (n=16), only respiratory allergy (n=7), as well as healthy women (n=22). Dietary intake of foods expected to affect long-chain n-3 PUFA levels were estimated by food-frequency questionnaire. The fatty acid pattern was related to diagnostic group and intake of relevant food items using a multivariate pattern recognition method (partial least squares projections to latent structures and discriminant analysis). Results Women with a combination of eczema and respiratory allergy had lower breast milk levels of several PUFAs (arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA, docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, and docosapentaenoic acid, DPA), and a lower ratio of long-chain n-3 PUFAs/n-6 PUFAs. Their PUFA levels differed not only from that of healthy women, but also from that of women with only respiratory allergy. The latter had a fatty acid pattern similar to that of healthy women. Despite low EPA, DHA and DPA levels women with eczema and respiratory allergy consumed no less fish than did healthy women. Conclusion & Clinical Relevance Our data suggest that reduced levels of long-chain n-3 fatty acids in serum and breast milk characterize women with extensive allergic disease including eczema, and are not related to low fish intake. Consumption of PUFAs during the allergic process may explain these findings. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Allergy; Atopic eczema; Atopy; Breast milk; DHA; EPA; Fatty acids","arachidonic acid; docosahexaenoic acid;

The study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. Microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative PCR and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The core population of the Lactobacillus group was identified as Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus oris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium catenulatum. The fecal numbers of L. acidophilus and B. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. The levels of Bifidobacterium correlated positively (P=0.03), while the levels of the Lactobacillus group negatively (P=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index. This correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. The main conclusion of the study is that administration of L. acidophilus NCFM and B. lactis Bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces. © 2011 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Interventions aiming to improve parent management of this condition are promising. Unfortunately, evaluation is hampered by lack of precise research tools to measure change. Objectives: To develop a suite of valid and reliable research instruments to appraise parents' self-efficacy for performing atopic dermatitis management tasks; outcome expectations of performing management tasks; and self-reported task performance in a community sample of parents of children with atopic dermatitis. Methods: The Parents' Eczema Management Scale (PEMS) and the Parents' Outcome Expectations of Eczema Management Scale (POEEMS) were developed from an existing self-efficacy scale, the Parental Self-Efficacy with Eczema Care Index (PASECI). Each scale was presented in a single self-administered questionnaire, to measure self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and self-reported task performance related to managing child atopic dermatitis. Each was tested with a community sample of parents of children with atopic dermatitis, and psychometric evaluation of the scales' reliability and validity was conducted. Setting and participants: A community-based convenience sample of 120 parents of children with atopic dermatitis completed the self-administered questionnaire. Participants were recruited through schools across Australia. Results: Satisfactory internal consistency and test-retest reliability was demonstrated for all three scales. Construct validity was satisfactory, with positive relationships between self-efficacy for managing atopic dermatitis and general perceived self-efficacy; self-efficacy for managing atopic dermatitis and self-reported task performance; and self-efficacy for managing atopic dermatitis and outcome expectations. Factor analyses revealed two-factor structures for PEMS and PASECI alike, with both scales containing factors related to performing routine management tasks, and managing the child's symptoms and behaviour. Factor analysis was also applied to POEEMS resulting in a three-factor structure. Factors relating to independent management of atopic dermatitis by the parent, involving healthcare professionals in management, and involving the child in the management of atopic dermatitis were found. Parents' self-efficacy and outcome expectations had a significant influence on self-reported task performance. Conclusions: Findings suggest that PEMS and POEEMS are valid and reliable instruments worthy of further psychometric evaluation. Likewise, validity and reliability of PASECI was confirmed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Atopic; Chronic disease management; Dermatitis; Eczema; Outcome expectations; Parenting; Self-efficacy","adult; article; atopic dermatitis; child; human; psychometry; self concept; treatment outcome; validation study; Adult; Child; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Psychometrics; Self Efficacy; Treatment Outcome",,,,,,"Conflict of interest : None declared.

It is unclear if sleep disruption in children with eczema has similar effects particularly after controlling for known comorbid disorders such as asthma and rhinitis. Methods: Parents of children (6-16 y) with eczema (n = 77) and healthy controls (n = 30) completed a validated omnibus questionnaire which included the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children, Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised (S), Child Health Questionnaire, Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index, and additional items assessing eczema, asthma, rhinitis, and demographics. Results: Compared to controls, children with eczema had a greater number of sleep problems with a greater percentage in the clinical range, lower quality of life, and higher levels of ADHD and oppositional behavior. They also had elevated rhinitis and asthma severity scores. Importantly, structural equation modelling revealed that the effect of eczema on the behavioral variables of Hyperactivity, ADHD Index, and Oppositional Behaviors were mediated through sleep with no direct effect of eczema on these behaviors. The comorbid atopic disorders of rhinitis and asthma also had independent effects on behavior mediated through their effects on sleep. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that the day-time behaviors seen in children with eczema are mediated independently by the effects of eczema, asthma, and rhinitis on sleep quality. These findings highlight the importance of sleep in eczematous children and its role in regulating day-time behavior.","Asthma; Behavior; Eczema; Rhinitis; Sleep; Structural equation modelling","article; asthma; attention deficit disorder; child; child behavior; clinical assessment; controlled study; demography; eczema; female; human; major clinical study; male; quality of life; rating scale; rhinitis; sleep disorder",,,,,,,,,,"Beasley, R., Keil, U., Von, M.E., Pearce, N., Worldwide variation in prevalence of symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and atopic eczema: ISAAC (1998) Lancet, 351 (9111), pp. 1225-1232. , DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)07302-9; Kay, J., Gawkrodger, D.J., Mortimer, M.J., Jaron, A.G., The prevalence of childhood atopic eczema in a general population (1994) Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 30 (1), pp. 35-39; Kemp, A.S., Atopic eczema: Its social and financial costs (1999) J Paediatr Child Health, 35, pp. 229-231; Robertson, C.F., Dalton, M.F., Peat, J.K., Haby, M.M., Bauman, A., Kennedy, J.D., Landau, L.I., Asthma and other atopic diseases in Australian children.

A first draft version containing 38 items organised in six dimensions was tested on a pilot sample of patients to assess its legibility. The extended version was then tested on a sample of 217 patients of both genders enrolled at 18 hospitals representative of the national distribution. The questionnaire was supplied together with the Morisky-Green compliance questionnaire, the health-related quality of life (HRQL) SF-12 questionnaire, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) of perceived health status to assess concurrent validity. The dimensionality was reduced by means of exploratory factor analysis, and reliability was evaluated on the basis of internal consistency and two halves reliability estimates. Item discriminant capability and questionnaire discriminant validity with respect to known groups of patients (by gender, principal diagnosis, age, disease severity and treatment) were also assessed.Results: The reduction and validation sample was composed of 54% women and 46% men, of various educational levels with an average age of 43 years (SD = 13.7). Of those who responded, 26% were diagnosed with hyperkeratotic dermatitis of the palms and 27% of the fingertips, and 47% with recurring palmar dyshidrotic eczema. The questionnaire was shortened to a version containing 17 items grouped in six dimensions: effectiveness, convenience, impact on HRQL, medical follow-up, side effects, and general opinion. Cronbach's alpha coefficient reached a value of 0.9. The dimensions showed different degrees of correlation, and the scores had a normal distribution with an average of 58.4 points (SD = 18.01). Treatment satisfaction scores attained correlations between 0.003 and 0.222 with the HRQL measures, and showed higher correlations with the effectiveness (r = 0.41) and tolerability (0.22) measures, but very low correlation with compliance (r = 0.015). Significant differences were observed between some diagnoses and treatments.Conclusions: The shortened questionnaire proved to have good psychometric properties, providing excellent reliability, satisfactorily reproducing the proposed structure and supplying evidence of validity. © 2010 Ruiz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"dermatological agent; adult; article; concurrent validity; consultation; correlation analysis; Cronbach alpha coefficient; discriminant validity; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug tolerability; educational status; factorial analysis; female; follow up; health status; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; medical care; normal distribution; palmoplantar keratoderma; patient satisfaction; pilot study; pompholyx; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; treatment response; visual analog scale; Eczema; Female; Hand Dermatoses; Humans; Male; Patient Satisfaction; Psychometrics; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results",,,,,,,,,,"Diepgen, T.L., Agner, T., Aberer, W., Berth-Jones, J., Cambazard, F., Elsner, P., Management of chronic hand eczema (2007) Contact Dermatitis, 57, pp. 203-210. , 10.1111/j.1600-0536.2007.01179.x, 17868211; Warshaw, E.M., Therapeutic options for chronic hand dermatitis (2004) Dermatol Ther, 17, pp. 240-250. , 10.1111/j.1396-0296.2004.04025.x, 15186370; Van Coevorden, A.M., Coenraads, P.J., Svensson, A., Bavinck, J.N., Diepgen, T.L., Naldi, L., Overview of studies of treatments for hand eczema-the EDEN hand eczema survey (2004) Br J Dermatol, 151, pp. 446-451. , 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.06040.x, 15327553; Morris, L.S., Schulz, R.M., Patient compliance--an overview (1992) J Clin Pharm Ther, 17, pp. 283-295; Murphy, J., Coster, G., Issues in patient compliance (1997) Drugs, 54, pp. 797-800. , 10.2165/00003495-199754060-00002, 9421690; Turbí, C., Herrero-Beaumont, G., Acebes, J.C., Torrijos, A., Graña, J., Miguélez, R., Sacristán, J.A., Marín, F., Compliance and Satisfaction with Raloxifene Versus Alendronate for the Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis in Clinical Practice: An Open-Label, Prospective, Nonrandomized, Observational Study (2004) Clinical Therapeutics, 26 (2), pp. 245-256. , 10.1016/S0149-2918(04)90023-9, 15038947; Cleary, P.D., McNeil, B.J., Patient satisfaction as an indicator of quality care (1988) Inquiry, 25, pp. 25-36; Shikiar, R., Rentz, A.M., Satisfaction with medication: an overview of conceptual, methodologic, and regulatory issues (2004) Val Health, 7, pp. 204-215; Hirsch, A.T., Atchison, J.W., Berger, J.J., Patient satisfaction with treatment for chronic pain: predictors and relationship to compliance (2005) Clin J Pain, 21, pp. 302-310. , 10.1097/01.ajp.0000113057.92184.90, 15951647; Charpentier, G., Fleury, F., Dubroca, I., Vaur, L., Clerson, P., Electronic pill-boxes in the evaluation of oral hypoglycemic agent compliance (2005) Diabetes & Metabolism, 31 (2), pp. 189-195; Aharony, L., Strasser, S., Patient satisfaction: What we know about and what we still need to explore (1993) Med Care Rev, 50, pp. 49-79. , 10.1177/002570879305000104, 10125117; Albrecht, G., Hoogstraten, J., Satisfaction as a determinant of compliance (1998) Comm Dent Oral Epidemiol, 26, pp. 139-146; Avis, M., Bond, M., Arthur, A., Satisfying solutions?

However, the more than 500 patient mutations described are mainly based on Caucasian and Japanese populations. This study investigated Taiwanese patients with WASP mutations since 1985 as part of a long-term comprehensive study in primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) covering 23 million inhabitants. Methods: Clinical manifestations, immunologic functions, and WASP gene sequencing and expressions were analyzed in WAS patients. And, those patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and ""small"" thrombocytopenia were enrolled. Results: Of 16 patients studied in 1993-2009, 12 presented as classic WAS phenotype and four had X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT). Almost all correlated to the WASP expression level and severity of infections. Causes of mortality in the 12 classic WAS patients were mass bleeding, Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis in three non-transplant cases, and EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder and CMV pneumonitis in two non-engrafted transplant patients. Splicing mutations of Int 8 (+5) G>A in cousins and insertion of 1023 C in unrelated families presented as both XLT and classic WAS phenotype in the same mutations. Four XLT patients, including two novel mutations of 1023 Ins C (in 2) and ""double"" missense mutations of 1378 C>T and 1421 T>C had relatively higher CD4+ memory cells and/or activated lymphocytes (CD3+CD69+) compared with those of classic WAS patients. Conclusions: The lower ratio of XLT to classic WAS patients underestimates the burden of Taiwanese patients with WASP mutations, especially the XLT phenotype. A clustering pattern on exon 1 and five unique mutations (deletion of 45-48 ACCA, IVS 1 (-1) G>C, large deletion of promoter and exon 1 and 2, insertion 1023 C, and 1378 C>T and 1421 T>C) explain the genetic variations in different ethnic groups, despite the possibility of selection and ascertainment bias. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Chinese; Genetic analysis; Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs); Taiwan; Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS); X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT)","CD16 antigen; CD19 antigen; CD3 antigen; CD69 antigen; cyclosporin A; famciclovir; ganciclovir; gene product; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; protein WAS; unclassified drug; Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein; adolescent; adult; article; autoimmune hemolytic anemia; bleeding; bronchiectasis; CD4 lymphocyte count; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; child; Chinese; clinical article; clinical feature; cord blood stem cell transplantation; cytomegalovirus infection; disease severity; Epstein Barr virus infection; ethnicity; exon; exon skipping; family history; female; frameshift mutation; gene expression; gene insertion; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic variability; glomerulonephritis; graft versus host reaction; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; heterozygote; human; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; immunoglobulin blood level; infection; intron; longitudinal study; lymphocyte activation; lymphocyte proliferation; lymphoproliferative disease; male; memory cell; memory T lymphocyte; missense mutation; mortality; natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity; nonsense mutation; nucleic acid base substitution; phenotype; pregnancy; priority journal; prognosis; promoter region; protein expression; relative; splenectomy; splicing mutation; staphylococcal bacteremia; thrombocyte transfusion; thrombocytopenia; virus pneumonia; Wiskott Aldrich syndrome; X linked thrombocytopenia; Asian continental ancestry group; cause of death; ethnology; family; genetics; mutation; nucleotide sequence; Taiwan; thrombocytopenia; Wiskott Aldrich syndrome; X chromosome linked disorder; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cause of Death; DNA Mutational Analysis; Family; Genetic Diseases, X-Linked; Humans; Mutation; Taiwan; Thrombocytopenia; Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome; Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cause of Death; DNA Mutational Analysis; Family; Genetic Diseases, X-Linked; Humans; Mutation; Taiwan; Thrombocytopenia; Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome; Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein",,"cyclosporin A, 59865-13-3, 63798-73-2; famciclovir, 104227-87-4; ganciclovir, 82410-32-0; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; immunoglobulin M, 9007-85-6; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein, 227189-07-3; Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein; Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein",,,"450021, CMRPG 32069

Alitretinoin is a novel agent which showed high clinical efficacy in patients with severe, refractory CHE. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of alitretinoin for CHE patient treatment from a Swiss third party payer perspective. A further objective of this study was to determine the burden of disease in Switzerland.Methods: A long-term Markov cohort simulation model was used to estimate direct medical costs (€) and clinical effectiveness (quality adjusted life years, QALYs) of treating severe CHE patients with alitretinoin. Comparison was against the standard treatment of supportive care (optimised emollient therapy). Information on response rates were derived from a randomized controlled clinical trial. Costs were considered from the perspective of the Swiss health system. Swiss epidemiological data was derived from official Swiss Statistic institutions.Results: Annual costs of alitretinoin treatment accounted for €2'212. After a time horizon of 22.4 years, average remaining long-term costs accounted for €42'208 or €38'795 in the alitretinoin and the standard treatment arm, respectively. Compared with the standard therapy, the addition of alitretinoin yielded an average gain of 0.230 QALYs at the end of the simulation. Accordingly, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio resulted in €14'816/QALY gained. These results were robust to changes in key model assumptions.Conclusion: The therapy for CHE patients is currently insufficient. In our long-term model we identified the treatment with alitretinoin as a cost-effective alternative for the therapy of CHE patients in Switzerland. © 2010 Blank et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adalimumab; alitretinoin; clobetasol propionate; ethinylestradiol; levonorgestrel; methoxsalen; mometasone furoate; placebo; prednisone; steroid; alitretinoin; retinoic acid; adult; aged; article; chronic hand eczema; clinical effectiveness; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; double blind procedure; drug cost; drug withdrawal; female; hand eczema; health care cost; health care system; health care utilization; human; long term care; major clinical study; optimised emollient therapy; probability; psoriasis; PUVA; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; severe chronic hand eczema; skin care; Switzerland; treatment response; adolescent; chronic disease; cost benefit analysis; cost of illness; economics; eczema; hospitalization; longitudinal study; middle aged; oral drug administration; pathophysiology; quality adjusted life year; treatment outcome; Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Chronic Disease; Cost of Illness; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Eczema; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Markov Chains; Middle Aged; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Severity of Illness Index; Switzerland; Treatment Outcome; Tretinoin; Young Adult",,"adalimumab, 331731-18-1; alitretinoin, 5300-03-8; clobetasol propionate, 25122-46-7; ethinylestradiol, 57-63-6; levonorgestrel, 797-63-7; methoxsalen, 298-81-7, 8004-26-0; mometasone furoate, 105102-22-5, 83919-23-7; prednisone, 53-03-2; retinoic acid, 302-79-4; Tretinoin, 302-79-4; alitretinoin, 5300-03-8",,,,,,,,"Halkier-Sorensen, L., Occupational skin diseases (1996) Contact dermatitis, 35 (1 SUPPL), pp. 1-120; Meding, B., Epidemiology of hand eczema in an industrial city (1990) Acta Derm Venereol Suppl (Stockh), 153, pp. 1-43; Coenraads, P.J., Bouma, J., Diepgen, T.L., [Quality of life of patients with occupationally-induced hand eczema] (2004) Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift fur Dermatologie, Venerologie, und verwandte Gebiete, 55 (1), pp. 28-30; Wallenhammar, L.M., Nyfjall, M., Lindberg, M., Meding, B., Health-related quality of life and hand eczema--a comparison of two instruments, including factor analysis (2004) J Invest Dermatol, 122 (6), pp. 1381-1389. , 10.1111/j.0022-202X.2004.22604.x, 15175027; Diepgen, T.L., [Chronic hand eczema: epidemiology and therapeutic evidence] (2008) Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift fur Dermatologie, Venerologie, und verwandte Gebiete, 59 (9), pp. 683-684. , 686-689; Meding, B., Jarvholm, B., Hand eczema in Swedish adults - changes in prevalence between 1983 and 1996 (2002) J Invest Dermatol, 118 (4), pp. 719-723. , 10.1046/j.1523-1747.2002.01718.x, 11918722; Diepgen, T.L., Agner, T., Aberer, W., Berth-Jones, J., Cambazard, F., Elsner, P., McFadden, J., Coenraads, P.J., Management of chronic hand eczema (2007) Contact dermatitis, 57 (4), pp. 203-210. , 10.1111/j.1600-0536.2007.01179.x, 17868211; Mortz, C.G., Lauritsen, J.M., Bindslev-Jensen, C., Andersen, K.E., Prevalence of atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and hand and contact dermatitis in adolescents.

Metastatic breast cancer, late-stage colon cancer, malignant melanoma, multiple myeloma, and other forms of cancer are still essentially incurable in most cases. Recent advances in genomic technologies have permitted the simultaneous evaluation of DNA sequence-based alterations together with copy number gains and losses. The requirement for a multi-targeting approach is the common theme that emerges from these studies. Therefore, the combination of new targeted biological and cytotoxic agents is currently under investigation in multimodal treatment regimens. Similarly, a combinational principle is applied in traditional Chinese medicine, as formulas consist of several types of medicinal herbs or minerals, in which one represents the principal component, and the others serve as adjuvant ones that assist the effects, or facilitate the delivery, of the principal component. In Western medicine, approximately 60 different arsenic preparations have been developed and used in pharmacological history. In traditional Chinese medicines, different forms of mineral arsenicals (orpiment-As2S3, realgar-As4S4, and arsenolite-arsenic trioxide, As2O3) are used, and realgar alone is included in 22 oral remedies that are recognized by the Chinese Pharmacopeia Committee (2005). It is known that a significant portion of some forms of mineral arsenicals is poorly absorbed into the body, and would be unavailable to cause systemic damage. This review primary focuses on the application of arsenic sulfide (realgar) for treatment of various forms of cancer in vitro and in vivo. © 2010 by the authors.","Arsenic sulfide; Cancer; Milling; Nanoparticle; Realgar","8 hydroxydeoxyguanosine; arsenic; arsenic derivative; arsenic sulfide; arsenic trioxide; BCR ABL protein; CD11b antigen; imatinib; nanoparticle; promyelocytic leukemia protein; retinoic acid; tetraarsenic oxide; unclassified drug; antiangiogenic activity; apoptosis; asthma; cancer chemotherapy; Chinese medicine; chorea; DNA damage; DNA fragmentation; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; drug cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; drug excretion; drug mechanism; drug penetration; drug solubility; eczema; gene expression regulation; growth inhibition; Hodgkin disease; human; isomerization; leukemia; leukemia remission; nonhuman; particle size; pemphigus; pernicious anemia; promyelocytic leukemia; protein degradation; protein phosphorylation; psoriasis; review; signal transduction; solid state; transcription regulation; unspecified side effect; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Arsenicals; Humans; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Sulfides",,"arsenic, 7440-38-2; arsenic trioxide, 1303-24-8, 1327-53-3, 13464-58-9, 15502-74-6; imatinib, 152459-95-5, 220127-57-1; retinoic acid, 302-79-4; Antineoplastic Agents; Arsenicals; Sulfides; arsenic disulfide, 56320-22-0",,,,,,,,"Kummar, C.S.S.R., (2006) Nanomaterials for Cancer Therapy, , WILEY-VCH Verlag: Weinheim, Germany; Ferrari, M., Cancer nanotechnology: Opportunities and challenges (2005) Nat.

Objectives The objective of this study was to develop a model to analyse the cost-effectiveness of a barrier-strengthening moisturizing cream as maintenance therapy compared with no treatment after initial treatment with betamethasone valerate in adult patients with AD in Sweden. A further aim was to apply a similar health-economic analysis for Denmark, Norway and Finland. Methods A Markov simulation model was developed including data from three sources: (i) efficacy data from a randomized controlled trial including patients with moderate AD treated with either a moisturizing cream or no treatment, (ii) resource utilization and quality of life data, and (iii) unit prices from official price lists. A societal perspective was used and the analysis was performed according to treatment practice in Sweden. The model simulation was also applied for Denmark, Norway and Finland with inclusion of country-specific unit costs. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results The results from the present analyses of treatment for patients with moderate AD indicate that maintenance treatment with a moisturizing cream during eczema-free periods could be cost-effective in a societal perspective. Similar results were obtained for Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. Conclusions According to the analysis, treatment with a moisturizing cream was found to be a cost-effective option compared with no treatment in eczema-free periods in adult patients with AD in the four Nordic countries. © 2009 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.","Atopic dermatitis; Cost-effectiveness; Model simulation; Moisturizer; Nordic countries","betamethasone valerate; canoderm; dermatological agent; unclassified drug; adult; aged; article; atopic dermatitis; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; cream; Denmark; Finland; health care utilization; human; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; mathematical model; Norway; priority journal; quality of life; sensitivity analysis; simulation; Sweden; Betamethasone 17-Valerate; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Denmark; Dermatitis, Atopic; Emollients; Finland; Glucocorticoids; Health Care Costs; Health Expenditures; Humans; Markov Chains; Models, Econometric; Norway; Primary Health Care; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sweden",,"betamethasone valerate, 2152-44-5, 57654-97-4; Betamethasone 17-Valerate, 2152-44-5; Emollients; Glucocorticoids",,,,,,,,"Halvarsson, K., Lodén, M., Increasing quality of life by imrpoving the quality of skin in patients with atopic dermatitis (2007) Int J Cosmet Sci, 29, pp. 69-83; Bingefors, K., Lindberg, M., Isacson, D., Self-reported dermatological problems and use of prescribed topical drugs correlate with decreased quality of life: An epidemiological survey (2002) Br J Dermatol, 147, pp. 285-290; Lundberg, L., Johannesson, M., Silverdahl, M., Quality of life, health-state utilities and willingness to pay in patients with psoriasis and atopic eczema (1999) Br J Dermatol, 141, pp. 1067-1075; Isacson, D., Bingefors, K., Lindberg, M., Self-reported dermatological problems and preferences for health: An epidemiological survey (2004) Acta Derm Venereol, 84, pp. 27-31; Lundberg, L., Johannesson, M., Silverdahl, M., Health-related quality of life in patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis measured with SF-36, DLQI and subjective measure of disease activity (2000) Acta Derm Venereol, 80, pp. 430-434; Schmitt, J., Meurer, M., Klon, M., Assessment of health state utilities of controlled and uncontrolled psoriasis and atopic eczema: A population-based study (2007) Br J Dermatol, 158, pp. 351-359; Abramovits, W., Boguniewicz, M., Paller, A.S., Whitaker-Worth, D.L., Prendergast, M.M., Tokar, M., Tong, K.B., The economics of topical immunomodulators for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (2005) PharmacoEconomics, 23 (6), pp. 543-566. , http://saturn.bids.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ds_deliver/1/u/d/ISIS/19808983.1/adis/ pec/2005/00000023/00000006/art00003/D714807354DCA5101121168388DF101F11BBE750B1. pdf?link=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/error/delivery&format=pdf, DOI 10.2165/00019053-200523060-00003; Ellis, C.N., Drake, L.A., Prendergast, M.M., Cost-effectiveness analysis of tacrolimus ointment versus high-potency topical corticosteroids in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (2003) J Am Acad Dermatol, 48, pp. 553-563; Lamb, S.R., Rademaker, M., Pharmacoeconomics of drug therapy for atopic dermatitis (2002) Exper Opin Pharmacother, 3, pp. 249-555; Hoare, C., Liwan, P.A., Williams, H., Systematic review of treatments for atopic eczema (2000) Health Technol Assess, 4, pp. 1-191; Elias, P., Wood, L., Feingold, K., Epidermal pathogenesis of inflammatory dermatoses (1999) Am J Contact Dermat, 10, pp. 119-126; Lucky, A., Leach, A., Laskarzewski, P., Use of an emollient as a steroid-sparing agent in the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in children (1997) Pediatr Dermatol, 14, pp. 321-324; Wiren, K., Nohlgard, C., Nyberg, F., Treatment with a barrier-strengthening moisturizing cream delays relapse of atopic dermatitis: A prospective and randomized controlled clinical trial (2009) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, , doi:; (2008) FASS 2008 (Pharmaceutical Specialties in Sweden)., , FASS.

Setting: Survey of Australian parents and primary care givers of children 0-15 years. Methods: The questionnaire was translated from Finnish to English then back-translated to ensure semantic equivalence. A total of 153 parents/main caregiver of a child aged 0-15 years were recruited via convenience sampling. Construct validity of the attitudinal section of the CMUQ was performed using exploratory factor analysis. Reliability was assessed using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient as a marker of internal consistency. Three focus groups were conducted to explore participants' attitudes towards medicating children and to triangulate quantitative data. Main outcome measure: Construct validity and internal reliability of the CMUQ. Results: Factor analysis generated a parsimonious four factor solution explaining 50% of variance in the data. The four subscales representing the four factor solution each returned a Cronbach's Alpha coefficient >0.6, indicating good internal consistency. Participants in focus groups were satisfied with the structure and content of the questionnaire. There were 5 emergent themes through focus group discussions with parents and primary care givers of children, regarding the perception of medicines use in children. These included, 'concerns about the negative effects of medicines', 'medicines are useful, necessary and safe in treating illnesses in children', 'the body's natural processes are sufficient in fighting illness', 'over the counter medicines are effective and useful in treating illness', 'perception of alternative medicines use in children'. Conclusions: The CMUQ is a valid and reliable tool to measure parents' medicine use for their children in an Australian sample. Although small modifications should be made, this instrument will be valuable in informing the development of medicines information for this cohort in the future. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Attitude; Australian children; Child; Factor analysis; Medicines use; Over the counter medicines; Prescription medicines; Questionnaire","antibiotic agent; antihistaminic agent; beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; corticosteroid; ibuprofen; non prescription drug; paracetamol; triacylglycerol; vitamin; adolescent; adult; allergy; article; asthma; Australia; caregiver; child; conjunctivitis; construct validity; controlled study; Cronbach alpha coefficient; eczema; factorial analysis; female; fever; health personnel attitude; health survey; human; internal consistency; male; medicine; New Zealand; otitis; parent; prescription; questionnaire; reliability; satisfaction; semantics; upper respiratory tract infection; validation process; Adolescent; Aging; Australia; Caregivers; Child; Child, Preschool; Consumer Satisfaction; Drug Therapy; Female; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Nonprescription Drugs; Parents; Pilot Projects; Prescription Drugs; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Self Administration; Statistics as Topic",,"ibuprofen, 15687-27-1; paracetamol, 103-90-2; Nonprescription Drugs; Prescription Drugs",,,,"The project was not funded through any research grants.",,,,"Australia's Health 2006 [Internet], , http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/index.cfm/title/10321, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2006 Canberra: AIHW cat. no.

Methods: Prevalences of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema obtained in Phase One of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) were matched with city-level estimates of residential PM10 obtained from a World Bank model. Associations were investigated using binomial regression adjusting for GNP per capita and for clustering within country. For countries with more than one centre, a two stage meta-analysis was carried out. The results were compared with a meta-analysis of published multi-centre studies. Results: Annual concentrations of PM10 at city level were obtained for 105 ISAAC centres in 51 countries. After controlling for GNP per capita, there was a weak negative association between PM10 and various outcomes. For severe wheeze in 13-14-year-olds, the OR for a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 was 0.92 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.00). In 24 countries with more than one centre, most summary estimates for within-country associations were weakly positive. For severe wheeze in 13-14-year-olds, the summary OR for a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM 10 was 1.01 (0.92 to 1.10). This result was close to a summary OR of 0.99 (0.91 to 1.06) obtained from published multi-centre studies. Conclusions: Modelled estimates of particulate matter at city level are imprecise and incomplete estimates of personal exposure to ambient air pollutants. Nevertheless, our results together with those of previous multi-centre studies, suggest that urban background PM10 has little or no association with the prevalence of childhood asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis or eczema either within or between countries.",,"adolescent; air pollution; ambient air; article; asthma; child; eczema; human; particulate matter; preschool child; prevalence; priority journal; rhinoconjunctivitis; school child",,,,,"Medical Research Council, MRC: G0801056, MC_U105292687",,,,,"Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (2007) Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), , http://www.ginasthma.org, accessed Mar 2008; Worldwide variations in the prevalence of asthma symptoms: The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) (1998) Eur Respir J, 12, pp. 315-335. , ISAAC Steering Committee; Pearce, N., Ait-Khaled, N., Beasley, R., Worldwide trends in the prevalence of asthma symptoms: Phase III of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) (2007) Thorax, 62, pp. 758-766; Pope III, C.A., Dockery, D.W., Health effects of fine particulate air pollution: Lines that connect (2006) J Air Waste Manag Assoc, 56, pp. 709-742; (2007) Health Relevance of Particulate Matter from Various Sources: Report on a WHO Workshop, Bonn, Germany, March 2007 WHO, Copenhagen, , World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe; Brunekreef, B., Holgate, S.T., Air pollution and health (2002) Lancet, 360, pp. 1233-1242; Riedl, M., Diaz-Sanchez, D., Biology of diesel exhaust effects on respiratory function (2005) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 115, pp. 221-228; Holgate, S.T., Sandstrom, T., Frew, A.J., Health effects of acute exposure to air pollution.

These genes are possible candidates for disease-specific pathogenetic changes, but could also provide a tool for molecular diagnostics of inflammatory skin conditions in general. Objectives To analyse if gene expression signatures as found in purified epidermal cells from AD are also present in other eczematous conditions such as allergic and irritant contact dermatitis. Methods We used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics to investigate gene expression in different forms of eczema. Normal epidermis and psoriatic epidermis were analysed for comparison. Results Carbonic anhydrase II was highly induced in epidermis from all forms of eczema but not in psoriasis. Remarkably, the presumed neuron-specific Nel-like protein 2 showed a strong induction only in AD epidermis. Interleukin-1F9, elafin, β-defensin-2 and vanin-3 were strongly induced in psoriasis, but not in any type of eczema. High levels of the chemokines CCL17 and CXCL10 were predominantly found in epidermis of allergic contact dermatitis. The chemokine CXCL8 was highly expressed in psoriasis, AD and allergic contact dermatitis, but not in irritant contact dermatitis. Cluster analysis or multinomial logistic regression indicated that expression levels of a set of seven genes are a strong predictor of the type of inflammatory response. Conclusions These observations contribute to molecular diagnostic criteria for inflammatory skin conditions. © 2009 British Association of Dermatologists.","Atopic dermatitis; Contact dermatitis; Cytokines;

Personal and family anamneses of the patient were selected and appropriately rated as predictive variables for discriminant analysis. These data were obtained by an evaluation of the atopy score. Moreover, both of these anamneses were divided into four categories according to doctor's ranked severity (asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema and others). The aim of the analysis is to predict results of the cost-expensive Phadiatop test, which is the categorical dependent variable of the model. The model was tested using a medical database of 1027 clients. The developed model predicts results of the Phadiatop test with 75% probability, which may represent significant financial savings for the diagnosis of atopy.","Atopy; Logistic regression; Medical data; Phadiatop test",,,,,,,,,,,"Hosmer, D.W., Lemeshow, S., (2000) Applied Logistic Regression, , NewYork: Wiley Interscience; Hajduková, Z., Vantuchová, Y., Klimková, P., Makhoul, M., Hromádka, R., Atopy in patiens with allergic contact dermatitis (2009) Jurnal of Czech Physicians: Occupational therapy, (2), pp. 69-73. , http://www.prolekare.cz/casopis-lekaru-ceskych-clanek?id=5780, In Czech; Hajduková, Z., Pólová, J., Kosek, V., (2005) The importance of Atopy Investigation in the Department of Travel Medicine, Allergies: Magazine for continuous education in allergy and clinical immunology, (2), pp. 106-109. , http://www.tigis.cz/alergie/alergieffi2-2005/obsah-f.htm, In Czech; Rabasová, M., Briš, R., Kuráňová, P., (2010) Modified Logistic Regression As A Tool For Discrimination.

Between January 2005 and December 2007, 62 newly diagnosed MRSA index persons (46 patients and 16 health care workers) and their 160 household contacts were included in the study analysis. Transmission of MRSA from an index person to household contacts occurred in nearly half of the cases (47%; n = 29). These 29 index persons together had 84 household contacts, of which two-thirds (67%; n = 56) became MRSA positive. Prolonged exposure time to MRSA at home was a significant risk factor for MRSA transmission to household contacts. In addition, MRSA colonization at least in the throat, younger age, and eczema in index persons were significantly associated with MRSA transmission; the presence of wounds was negatively associated with MRSA transmission. Furthermore, an increased number of household contacts and being the partner of a MRSA index person were household-related risk factors for MRSA acquisition from the index person. No predominant pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type was observed to be transmitted more frequently than other PFGE types. To date, screening household contacts and providing MRSA eradication therapy to those found positive simultaneously with the index person is not included in the ""search-and-destroy"" policy. We suggest including both in MRSA prevention guidelines, as this may reduce further spread of MRSA. Copyright © 2010, American Society for Microbiology.

The results were compared with a standard, obtained from healthy Chinese population, including factors of gender, age, educational level, medical history of AR, presence of complications, type of allergenic sensitizations and nasal symptoms (using logistic regression analysis).RESULTS: An abnormal psychological state was found in 10% of AR patients, 13% with deuto-healthy, and remaining 77% of AR patients were completely healthy. The SCL-90 scores of the 377 patients were significantly higher than those of the normal standard population, including symptoms of somatization, compulsion, anxiety, rivalry and psychosis (t equals 7.128, 3.943, 2.777, 6.423, 7.507, respectively, all P < 0.01). Male patients had worse psychological state than femals, especially in the aspects of compulsion, depression, anxiety, crankiness and psychosis (t equals respectively 2.680, 1.977, 2.539, 2.107, 2.844, all P < 0.05). The SCL-90 scores of compulsion and horror were respectively different in different AR case history (F equals respectively 2.379, 2.255, all P < 0.05). AR complicated with asthma and eczema was the important factors that influenced patient's psychological status including compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, crankiness and psychosis (t equals respectively 6.835, 8.914, 7.254, 13.358, 6.030, all P < 0.01). There were no statistical differences in different ages, AR types, educational level, allergen types (all P > 0.05). Snuffle, sneeze and snivel had no influence on patient's SCL-90 scores (all P > 0.05). Itchy nose was a major symptom that affect on AR patients' SCL-90 scores of depression (standard regression b = 0.126, t = 2.076, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: AR patients' psychological status was worse than that of the healthy adults.",,"allergen; allergic rhinitis; anxiety; factorial analysis; human; mental disease; Allergens; Anxiety; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Humans; Mental Disorders; Rhinitis, Allergic",,"Allergens",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16730860,,,"20193610","Chinese","Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982274264

From 200 selected households 650 household members aged ≥ 15 years were visited and examined dermatologically three times in July 2004, January and May 2005. Overall dermatitis prevalence was 6.1%. However, all cases (116) were found in the two wastewater villages involved in aquatic plant culture. Risk factor analysis restricted to the two wastewater villages showed that involvement in wastewater-fed aquatic plant production increased the risk of dermatitis in the univariable analysis but not in the multivariable analysis. Among family members involved in wastewater-fed aquatic plant production a longer duration of daily wastewater contact did not increase the risk of dermatitis in the multivariable analysis. Wet season, older age and having a history of skin problems in the three months prior to each survey were associated significantly with dermatitis. Very few aquaculture workers applied personal protection and the factor had no significant effect on dermatitis. The present study did not show a consistent association between occupational exposure to wastewater and dermatitis, unlike similar Vietnamese studies. © IWA Publishing 2009.","Dermatitis; Exposure to wastewater; Phnom Penh; Skin problems; Wastewater-fed aquaculture","aquaculture; aquatic plant; disease prevalence; health risk; multivariate analysis; occupational exposure; periurban area; risk factor; skin disorder; wastewater; adult; aquaculture; aquatic environment; aquatic flora; article; Cambodia; controlled study; dermatitis; disease association; female; follow up; household; human; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; nail disease; occupational exposure; prevalence; pruritus; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk factor; skin disease; skin infection; urban area; urticaria; waste water; age; aquaculture; Cambodia; cross-sectional study; middle aged; occupational disease; occupational eczema; occupational exposure; sewage; statistics; Cambodia; Phnom Penh; Adult; Age Factors; Agricultural Workers' Diseases; Aquaculture; Cambodia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Occupational; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sewage; Young Adult",,"Sewage",,,,,,,,"Anh, V.T., van der Hoek, W., Cam, P.D., Dalsgaard, A., Perceived health problems among users of wastewater for aquaculture in Southeast Asian cities (2007) Urban Water J, 4 (4), pp. 269-274; Anh, V.T., van der Hoek, W., Ersbøll, A.K., Thuong, N.V., Tuan, N.D., Cam, P.D., Dalsgaard, A., Dermatitis among farmers engaged in peri-urban aquatic food production in Hanoi, Vietnam (2007) Trop.

The aim of this study was to establish a better diagnostic routine procedure based on modern mass spectrometric peptide analysis techniques. One hundred and fifty-five nail samples from 145 patients with clinically suspected onychomycosis (n = 96, 62%) and without onychomycosis [e.g. nail psoriasis or nail dystrophy resulting from eczema (n = 59, 38%)] were investigated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) peptide mass fingerprinting in comparison with standard techniques.

The study design was cross-sectional, comparative stratified by age, gender, ethnicity, as well as by three types of drug use (noninjection; arm or upper body injection only; and legs with or without upper body injection). Subjects completed demographic, health, and substances abuse questionnaires and were evaluated using the clinical component of the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy- Pathophysiology Classification. Seven hundred and thirteen participants were evaluated. Those who injected in the legs ± arms had significantly worse CVD. Thirty-nine percent of leg ± arm injectors vs. 4.2% or noninjectors or arm only injectors had moderate to severe CVD. Persons who injected in the legs ± arms were 9.14 times more likely to develop venous ulcers than those that injected in the arms and upper body only and 34.64 times more likely as those who never injected. CVD was associated with injecting in the groin, legs and feet as compared with other sites.

A study was undertaken to determine whether dietary patterns in pregnancy are related to childhood asthma and related outcomes. Methods: In a population-based birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), dietary patterns in pregnancy previously identified using principal components analysis (""health conscious"", ""traditional"", ""processed"", ""vegetarian"" and ""confectionery"") were related to early wheezing phenotypes and eczema; wheezing, hay fever, eczema, doctor-diagnosed asthma, atopy and total IgE at 7 years; lung function and bronchial responsiveness at 8-9 years. In regression models, confounders were controlled for using propensity scores. Results: Univariately, the ""health conscious"" pattern was positively associated with eczema, total IgE, forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced expiratory flow and negatively associated with early wheezing and asthma (unadjusted odds ratios per standard deviation increase in pattern score for early persistent wheeze and asthma: 0.78 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.87), p = 7.3×10-6, N=8886 and 0.90 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.97), p = 0.007, N = 7625, respectively). The ""processed"" pattern was positively associated with early wheezing and negatively associated with atopy and forced vital capacity. On controlling for confounders, the effects were substantially attenuated and became non-significant (adjusted odds ratios for the associations of the ""health conscious"" pattern with early persistent wheeze and asthma: 1.00 (0.86 to 1.16), p = 0.99 and 0.95 (0.86 to 1.04), p = 0.27, respectively). Conclusions: In this cohort, dietary patterns in pregnancy did not predict asthma and related outcomes in the offspring after controlling for confounders.",,"immunoglobulin E; article; asthma; atopy; bronchus hyperreactivity; cohort analysis; dietary intake; eczema; female; forced expiratory volume; human; lung function; major clinical study; outcome assessment; phenotype; pregnancy; priority journal; progeny; wheezing",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,"Medical Research Council, MRC: G0401540, G9815508",,,,,"Tricon, S., Willers, S., Smit, H.A., Nutrition and allergic disease (2006) Clin Exp Allergy Reviews, 6, pp. 117-188; Kant, A.K., Dietary patterns and health outcomes (2004) Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 104 (4), pp. 615-635. , DOI 10.1016/j.jada.2004.01.010, PII S0002822304000112; Jacques, P.F., Tucker, K.L., Are dietary patterns useful for understanding the role of diet in chronic disease?

Aberrant mast cell activation is linked to a variety of allergic diseases, including asthma, eczema, rhinitis, and nasal polyposis, which in combination affect up to 20% of the population in industrialized countries. On activation, mast cells release a variety of signals that target the bronchi and vasculature and recruit other immune cells to the inflammatory site. Prominent among such signals are the cysteinyl leukotrienes, a family of potent proinflammatory lipid mediators comprising leukotriene C 4 (LTC4), LTD4, and LTE4. LTC 4, the parent compound, is secreted from mast cells following Ca 2+ influx through store-operated calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels. Here, we show that activated mast cells release a paracrine signal that evokes Ca2+ signals in spatially separate resting mast cells. The paracrine signal was identified as a cysteinyl leukotriene because 1) RNAi knockdown or pharmacological block of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme prevented activated mast cells from stimulating resting cells. 2) Block of cysteinyl leukotriene type I receptors on resting mast cells with the clinically prescribed receptor antagonist monte-lukast prevented their activation by active mast cells. 3) RNAi knockdown of cysteinyl leukotriene type I receptors on resting cells prevented them from responding to the paracrine signal derived from activated mast cells. 4) Purified LTC4 evoked Ca2+ signals in mast cells that were identical to those triggered by the paracrine signal. Low levels of stimulus intensity released sufficient levels of leukotriene to activate resting cells. Leukotriene secretion still occurred tens of minutes after stimulation, suggesting a role as a long-lasting trigger in mast cell activation. Stimulation of the cys-teinyl leukotriene receptor activated CRAC channels and evoked prominent store-operated Ca2+ entry. This resulted in further cysteinyl leukotriene production, triggering a positive feedback cascade. Acutely isolated mast cells from patients with allergic rhinitis exhibited store-operated Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels and responded to cysteinyl leukotrienes. Histological analysis of samples taken from patients revealed clustering of mast cells, often located within 20 μm of each other, a distance sufficient for paracrine signaling by leukotri-enes to operate effectively. We conclude that a positive-feedback cascade involving CRAC channels and cys-teinyl leukotrienes constitute a novel mechanism for sustaining mast cell activation.-Di Capite, J., Shirley, A., Nelson, C., Bates, G., Parekh, A.

OBJECTIVE: the objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of sensitization to topical drugs in a university center, to study the main characteristics of the affected population, and to identify the allergens related with the dermatitis. METHODS: a retrospective and descriptive study with patients submitted to patch tests. The study was conducted with subjects whose patch test to topical drugs was positive. RESULTS: 329 patients were submitted to patch tests and 42 (13%) had positive and relevant patch tests to topical drugs. Among these patients, 36 (85.7%) had positive patch tests to the principal component and 28 (66.7 %) to the other components. Some patients had more than one sensitization. Neomycin was the most important allergen. CONCLUSIONS: Among the studied patients, sensitization to topical agents happened in 13% of the cases, with slight preference for females and Caucasians. There was elevated sensitization to neomycin, a popular agent among patients and medical doctors. ©2009 by Anais Brasileiros de Dermatologia.","Dermatitis, contact; Dermatitis, contact/etiology; Eczema; Neomicyn; Neomicyn/adverse effects","allergen; chloramphenicol; neomycin; nitrofural; promethazine; quinoline; sulfadiazine; topical agent; article; controlled study; drug hypersensitivity; drug sensitization; human; major clinical study; patch test; skin allergy; university hospital",,"chloramphenicol, 134-90-7, 2787-09-9, 56-75-7; neomycin, 11004-65-2, 1404-04-2, 1405-10-3, 8026-22-0; nitrofural, 59-87-0; promethazine, 58-33-3, 60-87-7; quinoline, 91-22-5; sulfadiazine, 547-32-0, 68-35-9",,,,,,,,"Brandão, F.M., Goossens, A., Tosti, A., Topical drugs (2006) Contact Dermatitis, pp. 623-652. , Frosch PJ, Menné T, Lepoittevin JP.

The majority of these leg ulcers are due to problems in the veins, resulting in an accumulation of blood in the legs. Leg ulcers arising from venous problems are called venous (varicose or stasis) ulcers. The main treatment has been a firm compression garment (bandage or stocking) in order to aid venous return. There is a large number of compression garments available and it is unclear whether they are effective in treating venous ulcers and which compression garment is the most effective. Objectives: To undertake a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials of the clinical effectiveness of compression bandage or stocking systems in the treatment of venous leg ulceration. Specific questions addressed by the review are: 1. Does the application of compression bandages or stockings aid venous ulcer healing? 2. Which compression bandage or stocking system is the most effective? Search strategy: For this update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (14/10/08); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4 2008); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to October Week 1 2008); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2008 Week 41) and Ovid CINAHL (1982 to October Week 1 2008). No date or language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials recruiting people with venous leg ulceration that evaluated any type of compression bandage system or compression hosiery were eligible for inclusion. Comparators included no compression (e.g. primary dressing alone, non-compressive bandage) or an alternative type of compression. Trials had to report an objective measure of ulcer healing in order to be included (primary outcome for the review). Secondary outcomes of the review included ulcer recurrence, costs, quality of life, pain, adverse events and withdrawals. There was no restriction on date, language or publication status of trials. Data collection and analysis: Details of eligible studies were extracted and summarised using a data extraction table. Data extraction was performed by one review author and verified independently by a second review author. Main results: Overall, 39 RCTs reporting 47 comparisons were included. Review question 1: there was reasonable evidence from seven RCTs that venous ulcers healmore rapidly with compression than without. Review question 2: findings from six trials of single-component compression suggested that this strategy was less effective than multicomponent compression. Evidence fromcompression systems with two components (3 trials) and three components (4 trials) suggested better outcomes when an elastic component was included. Different versions of compression with four-components (based on the Charing Cross four-layer bandage system) have similar effectiveness (3 trials). Compression with four components (variants of the Charing Cross four-layer bandage) is more effective than multi-component compression that includes a short-stretch bandage (6 trials). It is difficult to determine the relative effectiveness of the four-layer bandage compared with paste bandage systems because of differences in the paste systems (5 trials). There was no difference in effectiveness between the adjustable compression boot and compression bandages (2 trials) or between single-layer compression stockings and paste bandages (2 trials). Two-layer stockings appeared more effective than the short-stretch bandage (2 trials). The relative effectiveness of tubular compression when compared with compression bandages was not clear from current evidence (2 trials). Three trials reported ulcer recurrence; because of sparseness of data and trials not being primarily designed to assess this outcome, firm conclusions could not be drawn. Although several trials included cost data, only one reported a rigorously conducted cost-effectiveness analysis with findings suggesting that the four-layer bandage was more cost-effective than multi-component compression comprising a short-stretch bandage. Seven trials assessed health-related quality of life and none observed significant differences between treatment groups. Several trials evaluated pain either as a stand-alone outcome, or as part of the assessment of adverse events. In general, the data did not indicate clear differences between treatment groups. It is possible that stockings could be associated with less pain than bandages but in view of scarcity of available data this requires further evaluation. Many of the trials reported adverse events and / or withdrawals. Overall, these outcomes appeared similar across different treatment groups. Authors' conclusions: Compression increases ulcer healing rates compared with no compression. Multi-component systems are more effective than single component systems. Multi-component systems containing an elastic bandage appear more effective than those composed mainly of inelastic constituents. Copyright © 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration.

In order to dissect the genetic background several linkage and genetic association studies have been performed. Yet very little is known about specific genes involved in this complex skin disease, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Methodology/Findings: We used human DNA microarrays to identify a molecular picture of the programmed responses of the human genome to AE. The transcriptional program was analyzed in skin biopsy samples from lesional and patch-tested skin from AE patients sensitized to Malassezia sympodialis (M. sympodialis), and corresponding biopsies from healthy individuals. The most notable feature of the global gene-expression pattern observed in AE skin was a reciprocal expression of induced inflammatory genes and repressed lipid metabolism genes. The overall transcriptional response in M. sympodialis patch-tested AE skin was similar to the gene-expression signature identified in lesional AE skin. In the constellation of genes differentially expressed in AE skin compared to healthy control skin, we have identified several potential susceptibility genes that may play a critical role in the pathological condition of AE. Many of these genes, including genes with a role in immune responses, lipid homeostasis, and epidermal differentiation, are localized on chromosomal regions previously linked to AE. Conclusions/Significance: Through genome-wide expression profiling, we were able to discover a distinct reciprocal expression pattern of induced inflammatory genes and repressed lipid metabolism genes in skin from AE patients. We found a significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes in AE with cytobands associated to the disease, and furthermore new chromosomal regions were found that could potentially guide future region-specific linkage mapping in AE.

As part of this discussion, we studied if adolescent allergic wheeze and increasing combinations of allergic organ involvements (lung, nose and skin) would also increase the reporting of other health problems (headache, muscle pain and abdominal pain). In addition, we studied if parental asthma was associated with adolescent clustering of allergic expressions and if parental asthma with additional health problems (headache or muscle pain) was associated with adolescent reporting allergy in combination with headache, muscle pain and abdominal pain. Adolescents 13-19 yr (n = 8817, 89%) participated in the Young-HUNT study, Norway, 1995-97. Parental data on asthma were eligible in n = 5620. Health and lifestyle were measured by questionnaires and interviews. Associations with additional health problems were significantly strengthened with combinations of wheeze and other allergic expressions. Odds Ratio for associations 'wheeze only', 'wheeze and rhinitis' and 'wheeze, rhinitis and eczema' were for headache 2.1, 3.4 and 3.7; for muscle pain 2.8, 3.2 and 4.9; for abdominal pain 3.6, 4.0 and 4.9. All p for trend were <0.010. Similar results were obtained when studying allergic wheeze; p for trend <0.001. Parental asthma was associated with clustering of adolescent allergic expressions, and parental asthma with headache or muscle pain was significantly associated with reported allergy combined with similar health problems in their offspring. The results indicate that allergy may be expressed beyond organs commonly viewed as part of an allergic disease, and hence may support a hypothesis of a systemic nature of allergic diseases. © 2008 The Authors.","Allergy; Asthma; Atopy; Eczema; Rhinitis; Wheeze","abdominal pain; adolescent; adult; allergy; article; asthma; eczema; female; headache; human; interview; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; myalgia; Norway; priority journal; questionnaire; rhinitis; self report; systemic disease; wheezing; Abdominal Pain; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Headache; Health Surveys; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Male; Muscles; Norway; Pain; Parents; Questionnaires; Respiratory Sounds; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,"Marshall G.D., Jr., Therapeutic options in allergic disease: Antihistamines as systemic antiallergic agents (2000) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 106, pp. S303-9; Schleimer, R.P., Togias, A.G., Systemic aspects of allergic disease (2000) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 106, p. 191; Vignola, A.M., Bousquet, J., Rhinitis and asthma: A continuum of disease?

The unrestricted network topology of the learning phase of GSOM enables clustering of data vectors based on the notion of similarity. The hierarchical clustering capability of the GSOM allows drill down examination of clusters at different levels of correlation. In addition to static patterns in the form of cluster groups, the feature map can also contain dynamic information of the dataset. There is continuous experimenting on enhancing the functionality of GSOM as a comprehensive data analysis and knowledge discovery application. This paper documents such extensions along with their application in knowledge discovery. The extensions were applied to a population based sample of children born to families in which either parents or/and siblings have had asthma, eczema or hay fever. The dataset contained time variant information on rash development and allergy diagnosis by skin prick testing to different allergens. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Adaptive algorithms; Applications; Chlorine compounds; Computer networks; Conformal mapping; Electric network topology; Flow of solids; Industrial engineering; Population statistics; Random variables; Self organizing maps; Statistical methods; Statistical tests; Sustainable development; Data sets; International conferences; Knowledge discovery; Cluster analysis",,,,,,,,,,"Alahakoon, D., Halgamuge, S.K., Sirinivasan, B., Dynamic Self Organizing Maps With Controlled Growth for Knowledge Discovery (2000) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 11 (3), pp. 601-614; Amarasiri, R., Wickramasinghe, L.K., Alahakoon, D., Enhanced Cluster Visualization Using the Data Skeleton Model (2003) 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Application (ISDA), , Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA; Alahakoon, L.D., Controlling the spread of dynamic self-organising maps (2004) Neural Computing & Applications, 13 (2), pp. 168-174; Amarasiri, R., Alahakoon, D., Applying Dynamic Self Organizing Maps for Identifying Changes in Data Sequences (2000) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 11 (3), pp. 601-614; Hsu, A., Tang, S., Halgamuge, S.K., An unsupervised hierarchical dynamic self-organizing approach to cancer class discovery and marker gene identification in microarray data (2003) Bioinformatics, 19 (16), pp. 2131-2140; Alahakoon, D., Halgamuge, S.K., Sirinivasan, B., (1998) A Structure Adapting Feature Map for Optimal Cluster Representation in Proceedings of The 5th International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP, pp. 809-812. , Kitakyushu, Japan, pp; De Silva, L.P.D.P., Alahakoon, D., Analysis of Seismic Activity using the Growing SOM for the Identification of Time Dependent Patterns (2006) IEEE Xplore - ICIA, pp. 683-688","De Silva, D.; Cognitive and Connectionist Systems Lab., Australia",,"Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society;IEEE Computational Intelligence Society;SAE",,"2007 3rd International Conference on Information and Automation for Sustainability, ICIAFS","4 December 2007 through 6 December 2007","Melbourne",73371,,9781424419005,,,"English","Proc.

In this study, we introduce the use of high-density oligonucleotide arrays for gene expression profiling in human skin during the elicitation of ACD. Skin biopsies from normal and nickel-exposed skin were obtained from seven nickel-allergic patients and five nonallergic controls at four different time points during elicitation of eczema. Each gene expression profile was analyzed by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Cluster analysis of 74 genes found to be differentially expressed in the patients over time revealed that the patient samples may be categorized into two groups: an early time-point group (no clinical reaction) and a late time-point group (clinical reaction). Bioinformatics analyses unraveled the potential involvement of signal transducers and activator of transcription and small/mothers against decepentaplegic (SMAD) transcription factors in the late time-point gene expression patterns. Concerning specific genes, the homeostatic chemokine CCL19 was unexpectedly found to be highly expressed in cells scattered in the deep dermis of the late time-point samples. Taken together, these findings suggest hitherto unknown roles of SMAD transcription factors and of CCL19 in the elicitation phase of ACD. © 2007 The Society for Investigative Dermatology.",,"biotin; complementary DNA; complementary RNA; macrophage inflammatory protein 3beta; nickel sulfate; Smad protein; STAT protein; transforming growth factor beta; adult; article; bioinformatics; clinical article; contact allergy; contact dermatitis; controlled study; DNA microarray; eczema; female; gene expression; human; human tissue; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; skin allergy; skin biopsy; time; Adult; Biopsy; Chemokines, CC; Cluster Analysis; Dermatitis, Allergic Contact; Down-Regulation; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Skin; Smad Proteins; Transcription Factors; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Up-Regulation",,"biotin, 58-85-5; macrophage inflammatory protein 3beta, 181030-14-8; nickel sulfate, 7786-81-4; Smad protein, 62395-38-4; CCL19 chemokine; Chemokines, CC; Smad Proteins; Transcription Factors; Transforming Growth Factor beta",,,"Sundhed og Sygdom, Det Frie Forskningsråd, FSS, DFF","This work was financially supported by the Foundation of Aage Bang, Denmark, The NovoNordic Foundation, the Danish Medical Research Council, The Copenhagen County Research Foundation, and the Alfred Nielsen and Wife's foundation.

Methods: The writing committee based its recommendations on an updated systematic literature review. Recommendations were approved by the Expert Panel, the ASCO Health Services Committee, and the ASCO Board of Directors. Results: Seven randomized controlled trials (four new), one systematic review, one meta-analysis (new), one Markov model, and one delta-method 95% CI procedure for active controlled trials (new) informed the guideline update. Recommendations: Bilateral orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists are recommended initial androgen-deprivation treatments (ADTs). Nonsteroidal antiandrogen monotherapy merits discussion as an alternative; steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy should not be offered. Combined androgen blockade should be considered. In metastatic or progressive PCa, immediate versus symptom-onset institution of ADT results in a moderate decrease (17%) in relative risk (RR) for PCa-specific mortality, a moderate increase (15%) in RR for non-PCa-specific mortality, and no overall survival advantage. Therefore, the Panel cannot make a strong recommendation for early ADT initiation. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics and other metrics allow identification of populations at high risk for PCa-specific and overall mortality. Further studies must be completed to assess whether patients with adverse prognostic factors gain a survival advantage from immediate ADT. For patients electing to wait until symptoms for ADT, regular monitoring visits are indicated. For patients with recurrence, clinical trials should be considered if available. Currently, data are insufficient to support use of intermittent androgen blockade outside clinical trials. © 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"androgen; antiandrogen; bicalutamide; buserelin; flutamide; gonadorelin agonist; goserelin; leuprorelin; luteinizing hormone; nilutamide; nonsteroidal antiandrogen; prostate specific antigen; unclassified drug; antiandrogen; antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; prostate specific antigen; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; anemia; arthralgia; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; backache; cancer growth; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; castration; clinical practice; clinical trial; consensus development; constipation; drug withdrawal; eczema; evidence based medicine; eye disease; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; gastrointestinal symptom; hormonal therapy; hot flush; human; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; liver function; liver function test; medical decision making; metastasis; monotherapy; mortality; orchiectomy; practice guideline; priority journal; prognosis; prostate cancer; pruritus; review; rhinopharyngitis; risk factor; side effect; therapy delay; treatment outcome; treatment planning; aged; cancer staging; disease course; disease free survival; male; meta analysis; metastasis; methodology; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; pathology; prostate tumor; risk assessment; survival; tumor recurrence; United States; Aged; Androgen Antagonists; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Combined Modality Therapy; Disease Progression; Disease-Free Survival; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Orchiectomy; Prognosis; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Risk Assessment; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; United States",,"bicalutamide, 90357-06-5; buserelin, 57982-77-1; flutamide, 13311-84-7; goserelin, 65807-02-5; leuprorelin, 53714-56-0, 74381-53-6; luteinizing hormone, 39341-83-8, 9002-67-9; nilutamide, 63612-50-0; Androgen Antagonists; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Prostate-Specific Antigen, EC 3.4.21.77",,,,,,,,"Loblaw, D.A., Mendelson, D.S., Talcott, J.A., American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations for the initial hormonal management of androgen-sensitive metastatic, recurrent, or progressive prostate cancer (2004) J Clin Oncol, 22, pp. 2927-2941; Akaza, H., Yamaguchi, A., Matsuda, T., Superior anti-tumor efficacy of bicalutamide 80 mg in combination with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist versus LHRH agonist monotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced prostate cancer: Interim results of a randomized study in Japanese patients (2004) Jpn J Clin Oncol, 34, pp. 20-28; Klotz, L., Schellhammer, P., Carroll, K., A reassessment of the role of combined androgen blockade for advanced prostate cancer (2004) BJU Int, 93, pp. 1177-1182; McLeod, D.G., Iversen, P., See, W.A., Bicalutamide 150 mg plus standard care vs standard care alone for early prostate cancer (2005) BJU Int, 97, pp. 247-254; Schroder, F.H., Kurth, K.H., Fossa, S.D., Early versus delayed endocrine treatment of pN1-3 M0 prostate cancer without local treatment of the primary tumor: Results of European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer 30846 - A phase III study (2004) J Urol, 172, pp. 923-927; Studer, U.E., Hauri, D., Hanselmann, S., Immediate versus deferred hormonal treatment for patients with prostate cancer who are not suitable for curative local treatment: Results of the randomized trial SAKK 08/88 (2004) J Clin Oncol, 22, pp. 4109-4118; Kirk, D., Timing and choice of androgen ablation (2004) Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Dis, 7, pp. 217-222; Studer, U.E., Whelan, P., Albrecht, W., Immediate or deferred androgen deprivation for patients with prostate cancer not suitable for local treatment with curative intent (2006) J Clin Oncol, 24, pp. 1868-1876; Reference deleted; de Leval, J., Boca, P., Yousef, E., Intermittent versus continuous total androgen blockade in the treatment of patients with advanced hormone-naive prostate cancer: Results of a prospective randomized multicenter trial (2002) Clin Prostate Cancer, 1, pp. 163-171; Rothmann, M., Li, N., Chen, G., Design and analysis of non-inferiority mortality trials in oncology (2003) Stat Med, 22, pp. 239-264; Fisher, L.D., Gent, M., Buller, H.R., Active control trials: How would a new agent compare with placebo?

We study multivariate procedures, in particular use of Hotelling's T2 for discrimination between the groups with a special emphasis on methods based on few genes only. We apply the methods to data from an experiment with a group of atopic dermatitis patients compared with a control group. We also compare our methodology to other recently proposed methods on publicly available datasets. It is found that (i) use of several genes gives a much improved discrimination of the groups as compared to one gene only, (ii) the genes that play the most important role in the multivariate analysis are not necessarily those that rank first in univariate comparisons of the groups, (iii) Linear Discriminant Analysis carried out with sets of 2-5 genes selected according to their Hotelling T2 give results comparable to state-of-the-art methods using many more genes, a feature of our method which might be crucial in clinical applications. Finding groups of genes that together give optimal multivariate discrimination (given the size of the group) can identify crucial pathways and networks of genes responsible for a disease.

The SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCOARD) is a widely used clinical score for assessing AD symptomatology over the preceding 3 days and the Nottingham Eczema Severity Score (NESS) is another score useful for AD symptoms over the preceding 12 months. Objective: We evaluated if these parameters are correlated with QOL in children with AD. Patients/Methods: We assessed quality of life, clinical scores, total IgE and eosinophil count in peripheral blood in AD patients at our paediatric dermatology clinic over a 14-month period. Results: Eighty AD patients (42 males and 38 females; mean [SD] age 11.7 [3.7] years) were recruited. The median (interquartile range, IQR) IgE, eosinophil counts and eosinophil percentage were 2988 (1069-7847) kIU/L; 0.6 (0.4-0.9) × 10-9/L; and 9 (6-12)%, respectively. Quality of life as measured with CDLQI (The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index) generally did not correlate well with both the acute and chronic AD severity scores (objective SCORAD and total CDQLI, ρ = 0.17, p &gt; 0.05; total NESS and total CDQLI, ρ = 0.29, p &lt; 0.05). Factor analysis further confirmed that the objective indicators (serum total IgE, eosinophil count and objective SCORAD), self-reported scores (NESS and subjective SCORAD) and CDLQI were separate dimensions in the assessment of AD in children. Conclusion: Quality of life, disease severity scores and laboratory atopic markers represent different domains in AD assessment. They do not necessarily correlate well with each other and all three aspects must be individually evaluated to assess the well-being of these patients. © 2006 Springer.","Atopic dermatitis; CDLQI; Children; Factor analysis; NESS; Quality of life; SCORAD","immunoglobulin E; article; atopic dermatitis; blood; children dermatology life quality index; correlation analysis; disease severity; eosinophil count; factorial analysis; female; human; immunoglobulin blood level; major clinical study; male; medical parameters; nottingham eczema severity score; pediatric hospital; priority journal; quality of life; school child; SCORing Atopic Dermatitis; scoring system; Adolescent; Biological Markers; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Biological Markers",,,,,,,,"Charman, C., Williams, H., Outcome measures of disease severity in atopic eczema (2000) Arch Dermatol, 136, pp. 763-769; Charman, C., Chambers, C., Williams, H., Measuring atopic dermatitis severity in randomized controlled clinical trials: What exactly are we measuring?

Chamomile tea, brewed from dried flower heads, has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes. Evidence-based information regarding the bioactivity of this herb is presented. The main constituents of the flowers include several phenolic compounds, primarily the flavonoids apigenin, quercetin, patuletin, luteolin and their glucosides. The principal components of the essential oil extracted from the flowers are the terpenoids α-bisabolol and its oxides and azulenes, including chamazulene. Chamomile has moderate antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, and significant antiplatelet activity in vitro. Animal model studies indicate potent antiinflanunatory action, some antimutagenic and cholesterol-lowering activities, as well as antispasmotic and anxiolytic effects. However, human studies are limited, and clinical trials examining the purported sedative properties of chamomile tea are absent.

Pimecrolimus, an immunosuppressant, was licensed in the U.K. in 2003 as an alternative treatment of mild to moderate atopic eczema. Objectives: To assess the cost-utility of pimecrolimus as a treatment for mild and moderate atopic eczema when compared with conventional treatments which use TCS and emollients. Methods: A Markov state-transition model was developed to represent the cyclical nature of atopic eczema and provide an economic analysis of cost-utility for treatment alternatives from the perspective of a third party payer (U.K. National Health Service). A range of methods was used to obtain data for transition probabilities, costs and quality of life. These included a systematic review of published effectiveness data, expert opinion, and a utility study conducted by the authors. Separate cohort analyses were modelled to distinguish between children and adult populations and between differing treatment patterns for facial and body eczema. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (using Monte-Carlo simulation) were performed. Results: Baseline cost-utility outputs from the model show that, in all tested scenarios, TCS dominate pimecrolimus (i.e. TCS are both cheaper and more effective). However, the differences in benefits between treatments output by the model are very small. Sensitivity analyses highlight the importance of cost variations in pimecrolimus. Where pimecrolimus is compared with emollient only it is probably cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30 000 per quality-adjusted life year. Conclusions: There are likely to be few situations in which the use of pimecrolimus for the treatment of atopic eczema can be justified on economic grounds. Exceptions are likely to be in cases where TCS have been shown to be ineffective, unacceptable due to adverse events, or where a patient is unwilling to accept TCS treatment despite appropriate education and support and emollient alone is the alternative clinical option. © 2006 British Association of Dermatologists.","Atopic dermatitis; Cost-utility analysis; Health economics; Immunosuppressant","corticosteroid; emollient agent; pimecrolimus; application site burning; atopic dermatitis; cohort analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; disease severity; human; priority journal; pruritus; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; review; sensitivity analysis; side effect; skin infection; skin manifestation; systematic review; Adult; Child; Costs and Cost Analysis; Dermatitis, Atopic; Drug Costs; Drug Therapy, Combination; Emollients; England; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Markov Chains; Quality of Life; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index; Tacrolimus; Treatment Failure; Treatment Outcome",,"pimecrolimus, 137071-32-0; Emollients; Glucocorticoids; Immunosuppressive Agents; pimecrolimus; Tacrolimus, 109581-93-3",,,,,,,,"Williams H, C., Strachan, D.P., The natural history of childhood eczema: Observations from the British 1958 birth cohort study (2003) Br J Dermatol, 139, pp. 834-9; Charman C, R., Morris, A.D., Williams, H.C., Topical corticosteroid phobia in patients with atopic eczema (2000) Br J Dermatol, 142, pp. 931-6; Ashcroft D, M., Dimmock, P., Garside, R., Efficacy and tolerability of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (2005) BMJ, 330, p. 516; Eichenfield L, F., Lucky, A.W., Boguniewicz, M., Safety and efficacy of pimecrolimus (ASM 981) cream 1% in the treatment of mild and moderate atopic dermatitis in children and adolescents (2002) J Am Acad Dermatol, 46, pp. 495-504; Whalley D, Huels, J., McKenna, S.P., The benefit of pimecrolimus (Elidel, SDZ ASM 981) on parents' quality of life in the treatment of pediatric atopic dermatitis (2002) Pediatrics, 110, pp. 1133-6; Wahn U, Bos, J.D., Goodfield, M., Efficacy and safety of pimecrolimus cream in the long-term management of atopic dermatitis in children (2002) Pediatrics, 110, p. 2; Meurer M, Folster-Holst, R., Wozel, G., Pimecrolimus cream in the long-term management of atopic dermatitis in adults: A six-month study (2002) Dermatology, 205, pp. 271-7; Luger T, Van Leent, E.J., Graeber, M., SDZ ASM 981: An emerging safe and effective treatment for atopic dermatitis (2001) Br J Dermatol, 144, pp. 788-94; Weinstein M, C., O'Brien, B., Hornberger, J., Principles of good practice for decision analytic modeling in health-care evaluation: Report of the ISPOR Task Force on Good Research Practices - Modeling Studies (2003) Value Health, 6, pp. 9-17; Finlay A, Y., Measurement of disease activity and outcome in atopic dermatitis (1996) Br J Dermatol, 135, pp. 509-15; Stevens K, Brazier, J., McKenna, S., The development of a preference based measure of health in children with atopic eczema (2005) Sheffield Health Economics Group Discussion Paper; The PenTAG Value of Health Panel, , website: (accessed 30 June 2005); British National Formulary, , British Medical Association & Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain No. 49; Su J, C., Kemp, A.S., Varigos, G.A., Atopic eczema: Its impact on the family and financial cost (1997) Arch Dis Child, 76, pp. 159-62; Briggs A, H., Gray, A.M., Handling uncertainty when performing economic evaluations of healthcare interventions (1999) Health Technol Assess, 3, pp. 1-134; Fenwick E, Claxton, K., Sculpher, M., Representing uncertainty: The role of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (2001) Health Econ, 10, pp. 779-87; U.S. Food and Drug Administration website: (accessed 12 October 2005)","Pitt, M.; Peninsula Technology Assessment Group, , Southernhay East, Exeter EX1 1PQ, United Kingdom; email: m.pitt@exeter.ac.uk",,,,,,,,00070963,,BJDEA,"16704646","English","Br.

The epidemiological data to date are limited; we sought to improve on the design of some previously conducted studies in order to facilitate revision and refinement of guidelines for exposure to cyanobacteria in recreational waters. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted to investigate the incidence of acute symptoms in individuals exposed, through recreational activities, to low (cell surface area &lt;2.4 mm2/mL), medium (2.4-12.0 mm2/mL) and high (&gt;12.0 mm2/mL) levels of cyanobacteria in lakes and rivers in southeast Queensland, the central coast area of New South Wales, and northeast and central Florida. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed; models adjusted for region, age, smoking, prior history of asthma, hay fever or skin disease (eczema or dermatitis) and clustering by household. Results: Of individuals approached, 3,595 met the eligibility criteria, 3,193 (89%) agreed to participate and 1,331 (37%) completed both the questionnaire and follow-up interview. Respiratory symptoms were 2.1 (95%CI: 1.1-4.0) times more likely to be reported by subjects exposed to high levels of cyanobacteria than by those exposed to low levels. Similarly, when grouping all reported symptoms, individuals exposed to high levels of cyanobacteria were 1.7 (95%CI: 1.0-2.8) times more likely to report symptoms than their low-level cyanobacteria-exposed counterparts. Conclusion: A significant increase in reporting of minor self-limiting symptoms, particularly respiratory symptoms, was associated with exposure to higher levels of cyanobacteria of mixed genera. We suggest that exposure to cyanobacteria based on total cell surface area above 12 mm2/mL could result in increased incidence of symptoms. The potential for severe, life-threatening cyanobacteria-related illness is likely to be greater in recreational waters that have significant levels of cyanobacterial toxins, so future epidemiological investigations should be directed towards recreational exposure to cyanotoxins. © 2006 Stewart et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"fresh water; adolescent; adult; anamnesis; article; asthma; cell surface; cigarette smoking; controlled study; Cyanobacterium; dermatitis; eczema; female; follow up; hay fever; household; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; questionnaire; school child; skin disease; symptomatology; Australia; child; cohort analysis; cyanobacterium; environmental exposure; epidemic; eutrophication; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; microbiology; middle aged; preschool child; prospective study; recreation; risk assessment; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Cyanobacteria; Disease Outbreaks; Environmental Exposure; Eutrophication; Florida; Fresh Water; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; Humans; Middle Aged; New South Wales; Prospective Studies; Queensland; Recreation; Risk Assessment; Water Microbiology",,,,,,,,,,"Stewart, I., Webb, P.M., Schluter, P.J., Shaw, G.R., Recreational and occupational field exposure to freshwater cyanobacteria - A review of anecdotal and case reports, epidemiological studies and the challenges for epidemiologic assessment (2006) Environ Health, 5 (1), p. 6; Philipp, R., Health risks associated with recreational exposure to blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) when dinghy sailing (1992) Health Hyg, 13, pp. 110-114; Philipp, R., Bates, A.J., Health-risks assessment of dinghy sailing in Avon and exposure to cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) (1992) J Inst Water Environ Manage, 6, pp. 613-620; Philipp, R., Brown, M., Bell, R., Francis, F., Health risks associated with recreational exposure to blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) when windsurfing and fishing (1992) Health Hyg, 13, pp. 115-119; El Saadi, O.E., Esterman, A.J., Cameron, S., Roder, D.M., Murray River water, raised cyanobacterial cell counts, and gastrointestinal and dermatological symptoms (1995) Med J Aust, 162 (3), pp. 122-125; Pilotto, L.S., Douglas, R.M., Burch, M.D., Cameron, S., Beers, M., Rouch, G.J., Robinson, P., Attewell, R.G., Health effects of exposure to cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) during recreational water-related activities (1997) Aust N Z J Public Health, 21 (6), pp. 562-566; (2003) Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments - Volume 1: Coastal and Fresh Waters, 1. , http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/bathing/srwg1.pdf, Geneva: World Health Organization; (2005) Current Approaches to Cyanotoxin Risk Assessment, Risk Management and Regulation in Different Countries, , http://www.umweltbundesamt.org/fpdf-l/2910.pdf, Chorus I, Ed: Berlin: Federal Environmental Agency (Umweltbundesamt); Stewart, I., (2004) Recreational Exposure to Freshwater Cyanobacteria: Epidemiology, Dermal Toxicity and Biological Activity of Cyanobacterial Lipopolysaccharides, , http://eprint.uq.edu.au/archive/00001883/, PhD thesis Brisbane: University of Queensland; Lawrence, J.F., Menard, C., Cleroux, C., Evaluation of prechromatographic oxidation for liquid chromatographic determination of paralytic shellfish poisons in shellfish (1995) J AOAC Int, 78 (2), pp. 514-520; Lawton, L.A., Edwards, C., Codd, G.A., Extraction and high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of microcystins in raw and treated waters (1994) Analyst, 119, pp. 1525-1530; Eaglesham, G.K., Norris, R.L., Shaw, G.R., Smith, M.J., Chiswell, R.K., Davis, B.C., Neville, G.R., Moore, M.R., Use of HPLC-MS/MS to monitor cylindrospermopsin, a blue-green algal toxin, for public health purposes (1999) Environ Toxicol, 14 (1), pp. 151-154; (2005) Effects on Recreation Activities, , http://www.nrm.qld.gov.au/water/blue_green/recreation.html, State of Queensland; (2000) Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Water Quality.

Methods: Analyses were based on self-reported asthma, hay fever and eczema and symptoms of the same diseases among 3334 pairs of Norwegian twins aged 18-35 years. Structural equation modelling was conducted to estimate the genetic and environmental variance structures. Results: For all diseases the concordances and the twin correlations were higher among monozygotic than among dizygotic twins. The results of the modelling confirmed that genetic effects were substantial for the diseases, and were more moderate for symptoms. The phenotypic correlation between disease and symptom was 0.67 for asthma and wheeze (a/w), 0.64 for hay fever and sneeze (hf/s), and 0.54 for eczema and itch (e/i). Decomposition of these correlations into genetic (G) and environmental (E) pathways revealed that G = 0.48 and E = 0.19 for a/w, G = 0.40 and E = 0.24 for hf/s, and G = 0.34 and E = 0.20 for e/i. For the diseases, the specific sources of genetic variance accounted for more variation than the specific environmental variance. Variance decomposition revealed that specific sources of variance were primarily explained by genetic effects for diseases and by environmental influences for symptoms. Conclusions: Genetic effects account for greater variation in reported diseases than symptoms. Co-occurrence of diseases and symptoms is mainly explained by genetic effects common to both phenotypes, but non-shared environment is also important. © The Author 2005; all rights reserved.","Atopic diseases; Environment; Genes; Symptoms","health and disease; adult; article; asthma; correlation analysis; disease severity; dizygotic twins; eczema; environmental factor; female; hay fever; heredity; human; major clinical study; male; monozygotic twins; Norway; pathogenesis; phenotype; prevalence; priority journal; pruritus; self report; symptom; wheezing; Adult; Asthma; Dermatitis, Atopic; Diseases in Twins; Environment; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Male; Pruritus; Respiratory Sounds; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal",,,,,"QLG2-CT-2002-01254

Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated infective dermatitis (IDH) is a chronic and recurrent eczema occurring during childhood and adolescence. HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a chronic myelopathy of adulthood, presenting with slowly progressive spastic paraparesis and sphincter dysfunction with mild sensory involvement. There are few reports describing an association between IDH and HAM/TSP. The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of HAM/TSP in patients with IDH and in seropositive members of their families and to determine the blood levels of antibodies against HTLV-1 in patients with HAM/TSP. Methods. Twenty patients with IDH and their seropositive mothers and siblings underwent clinical, neurological, and laboratory evaluations. The diagnosis of HAM/TSP was made in accordance with the World Health Organization criteria. Results. Nine individuals had HAM/TSP (6 of the patients with IDH, 2 mothers, and l seropositive brother). In 3 families, >1 individual had HAM/TSP. The serum antibody titers of the patients with HAM/TSP varied from 1:3.125 to 1:78.125. Conclusions. A strong association was observed between IDH and HAM/TSP. The familial clustering of both diseases suggests a genetic background. Serological screening for HTLV-1 in children with symptoms of myelopathy is essential in areas where HTLV-1 is endemic. © 2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

This study investigated the association between allergic disease in children and prolonged breastfeeding. Data were collected from a 15% random sample of households from two poor suburbs of Cape Town, South Africa. Parents completed a validated International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire on allergic diseases for children aged 6-14 yrs. Other questions included breastfeeding duration, maternal smoking and parental allergy. Results were adjusted for possible confounders and for possible clustering within the household. Out of the 861 children included in the study, allergic disease in general, and hay fever in particular, were significantly less frequent in those with prolonged (≥6 months) breastfeeding. There was a significant linear inverse association between breastfeeding duration and allergic disease in children without allergic parents, but not in children with an allergic predisposition. In conclusion, these results from a developing country suggest a protective effect of prolonged breastfeeding on the development of allergic disease, particularly hay fever, in children born to nonallergic parents. This protective effect was not found in children with an allergic predisposition.

Methods: To further examine the relationship between nickel, cobalt, chromate, and the factors that may potentially be related to concurrent sensitizations to two or all three metal allergens, data from the Information Network of Dermatology Departments (IVDK, http://www.ivdk.org) have been investigated. Results: Women had a higher conditional odds of concurrent nickel-cobalt (OR = 6.80; 95% CI: 5.65-8.19) and nickel-chromate (OR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.67-2.72) reactions than men. Construction workers had a significantly higher odds of cobalt-chromate reactions (OR = 13.89; 95% CI: 10.36-18.64), while the odds of isolated cobalt allergy was only 0.92 (95% CI: 0.48-1.74). Patients with underlying atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome had a 40-90% higher chance of any positive outcome, which involved chromate. Polysensitization, defined as the number of positive reactions to standard series substances other than nickel, cobalt, and chromate, was also significantly associated with the concurrent reactions; moreover, steady and significant effect gradients were noted. Conclusions: This research confirms the occupational nature of cobalt-chromate concurrent reactions, in particular, in construction workers. Polysensitization, which is considered to represent susceptibility to delayed-hypersensitivity in general, is also associated with the concurrent reactions to the metals. Hence, not only coupled exposure, but also individual susceptibility may be responsible for concurrent reactions to metals in man.

Proteins with statistically significant differences in expression were used in hierarchical cluster analyses resulting in separation of the different samples into groups. Chronic plaque and guttate psoriasis samples were distinctly separated, indicating that they represent discrete phenotypes at the protein expression level. Interestingly, there was a trend in which guttate psoriasis lesions clustered closer to eczema than to chronic plaque psoriasis lesions, indicating that the duration of the inflammatory reaction may affect clustering.

Data sources: Electronic databases. Experts and the manufacturers of these agents were also approached for information. Review methods: The systematic review was carried out using standard methodological guidelines and a stringent quality assessment strategy. A state transition (Markov) model was developed to estimate cost-utility of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus separately, compared with current standard practice with topical corticosteroids, (a) as first-line treatment and (b) as second-line treatment. Pimecrolimus was also compared to emollients only. Results: The pimecrolimus trial reports were of varying quality; however when compared with a placebo (emollient), pimecrolimus was found to be more effective and to provide quality of life improvements. There is very little evidence available about pimecrolimus compared with topical corticosteroids. Compared with a placebo (emollient), both 0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus were found to be more effective. Compared with a mild corticosteroid, 0.03% tacrolimus is more effective in children as measured by a 90% or better improvement in the Physician's Global Evaluation (PGE). Compared with potent topical corticosteroids, no significant difference in effectiveness is seen with 0.1% tacrolimus as measured by a 75% or greater improvement in the PGE. Minor application site adverse effects are common with tacrolimus. However, this did not lead to increased rates of withdrawal from treatment in trial populations. The Pen Tag economic model demonstrates a large degree of uncertainty, which was explored in both deterministic and stochastic analyses. This is the case for the cost-effectiveness of pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in first- or second-line use compared with topical steroids. In all cases immunosuppressant regimes were estimated to be more costly than alternatives and differences in benefits to be small and subject to considerable uncertainty. Conclusions: There is limited evidence from a small number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that pimecrolimus is more effective than placebo treatment in controlling mild to moderate atopic eczema. Although greater than for pimecrolimus, the evidence base for tacrolimus in moderate to severe atopic eczema is also limited. At both 0.1% and 0.03% potencies, tacrolimus appears to be more effective than the placebo treatment and mild topical corticosteroids. However, these are not the most clinically relevant comparators. Compared with potent topical corticosteroids, no significant difference was shown. Short-term adverse effects with both immunosuppressants are relatively common, but appear to be mild. Experience of long-term use of the agents is lacking so the risk of rare but serious adverse effects remains unknown. No conclusions can be confidently drawn about the cost-effectiveness of pimecrolimus or tacrolimus compared with active topical corticosteroid comparators. Areas for further research should focus on the effectiveness and safety of the treatments through good-quality RCTs and further economic analysis. © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2005.

Methods: Between 1992 and 1996, each centre studied random samples of children aged 13-14 and 6-7 years (approx. 3000 per age group and centre) using standardised written and video questionnaires on symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and atopic eczema during the past 12 months. Data on long term climatic conditions in the centres were abstracted from one standardised source, and mixed linear regression models calculated to take the clustering of centres within countries into account. Results: In Western Europe (57 centres in 12 countries), the prevalence of asthma symptoms, assessed by written questionnaire, increased by 2.7% (95% CI 1.0% to 4.5%) with an increase in the estimated annual mean of indoor relative humidity of 10%. Similar associations were seen for the video questionnaire and the younger age group. Altitude and the annual variation of temperature and relative humidity outdoors were negatively associated with asthma symptoms. The prevalence of eczema symptoms correlated with latitude (positively) and mean annual outdoor temperature (negatively). Conclusions: Results suggest that climate may affect the prevalence of asthma and atopic eczema in children.",,"adolescent; allergic rhinitis; altitude; article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; climate; cluster analysis;

As no published cost-effectiveness studies were found that compared imatinib and IFN-α, an independent Markov model was constructed and this was compared with models submitted to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence by the manufacturer of imatinib. Results: Intention-to-treat analysis showed that imatinib was associated with complete CR at 12 months follow-up of 68% compared with 20% for the IFN-α plus Ara-C group. The estimated proportion of people taking imatinib who had not progressed to accelerated or blast phases at 12 months was 98.5%, and 93.1% for IFN-α plus Ara-C. Overall survival was not statistically significantly different. Withdrawal due to side-effects was 2% for imatinib and 5.6% for IFN-α plus Ara-C. Cross-over due to intolerance was 0.7% and 22.8% for imatinib and for IFN-α plus Ara-C, respectively. Quality of life was better in the imatinib group than the IFN-α group when assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months. Median survival across the four IFN-α versus hydroxyurea studies was 66 and 56.2 months, respectively. Median complete CR was 6% for IFN-α and 0 for hydroxyurea. Median withdrawal due to side-effects was 24% and 4% for IFN-α and hydroxyurea, respectively. Four out of the five studies comparing BMT and IFN-α showed a long-term survival advantage for BMT over IFN-α, but a short-term disadvantage. In four of the five studies comparing BMT and IFN-α, median survival had not yet been reached in the BMT groups in 6-10 years. Median survival in the IFN-α arms ranged from 5.2 to 7 years. The BMT group gained a survival advantage over IFN-α at 3-5.5 years. In the BMT group death due to transplant-related complications ranged from 36 to 45%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of imatinib compared with IFN-α from the independent model was £26,180 per quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY) gained and was relatively robust. Imatinib was less cost-effective than hydroxyurea with an ICER of £86,934. Conclusions: Imatinib appears to be more effective than current standard drug treatments in terms of cytogenetic response and progression-free survival, with fewer side-effects. However, there is uncertainty concerning longer term outcomes, the development of resistance to imatinib, the duration of response and the place of imatinib relative to BMT. New issues are continually arising, such as optimal management pathways and combination therapies. Recommendations for research include: long-term follow-up data from the first-and second-line imatinib trials; investigation into specific subgroups, e.g. high-risk patients, the elderly, children or those eligible for BMT; long-term comparisons of imatinib with BMT performed in early stages of CML; the use of imatinib in combination with other therapies, and further detailed economic studies. Investigation of the impact of CML and imatinib on quality of life is also important. © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2004.

An example is the analysis of the many types of adverse events (AEs) that are recorded in drug clinical trials. We propose a three-level hierarchical mixed model. The most basic level is type of AE. The second level is body system, each of which contains a number of types of possibly related AEs. The highest level is the collection of all body systems. Our analysis allows for borrowing across body systems, but there is greater potential-depending on the actual data-for borrowing within each body system. The probability that a drug has caused a type of AE is greater if its rate is elevated for several types of AEs within the same body system than if the AEs with elevated rates were in different body systems. We give examples to illustrate our method and we describe its application to other types of problems.","Drug safety analysis; Mixture model; Multiple comparisons; Three-level hierarchical model","Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine; measles mumps rubella vaccine; drug development; accounting; analytic method; anorexia; article; asthenia; bronchitis; chickenpox; child; clinical trial; comparative study; conjunctivitis; constipation; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; coughing; crying; dehydration; diaper dermatitis; diarrhea; drug mixture; drug safety; eczema; fatigue; female; fever; gastroenteritis; Haemophilus influenzae; human; insect bite; insect sting; insomnia; irritability; lung congestion; lymphadenopathy; major clinical study; malaise; male; model; mumps; mycosis; nausea; nose congestion; otitis media; otorrhea; pharyngitis; pruritus; randomized controlled trial; rash; rhinorrhea; risk assessment; rubella; side effect; sinusitis; statistical analysis; thrush; tonsillitis; upper respiratory tract infection; urticaria; virus infection; vomiting; wheezing; Biometry; Chickenpox Vaccine; Humans; Infant; Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Randomized Controlled Trials; Safety; Vaccines, Combined; Viral Vaccines; Haemophilus; Haemophilus influenzae; Haemophilus influenzae serotype B; Insecta",,"Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, 126161-67-9; Chickenpox Vaccine; measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine; Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Vaccines, Combined; Viral Vaccines","pedvaxhib",,,,,,,"Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 57, pp. 289-300; Berry, D.A., Multiple comparisons, multiple tests, and data dredging: A Bayesian perspective (1988) Bayesian Statistics, , J.

The purpose of this study of 100 patients (51 females and 49 males) at an occupational dermatology clinic was to investigate whether the generic questionnaire Short Form-36 (SF-36), and the dermatology-specific Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) are appropriate for assessing health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with hand eczema, and whether gender differences in HRQL could be detected. HRQL was affected by hand eczema, measured with both SF-36 and DLQI. The SF-36 showed more impaired HRQL for females than for males, in the mental health dimension, whereas no gender-related differences were detected with the DLQI. To compare the instruments we used factor analysis, with a polychoric correlation matrix as input, thus taking the ordinal aspect of the data into account. There was a high correlation between the instruments for physical health, but lower for mental health. In this context our interpretation of the factor analysis is that the SF-36 measures mental health better than the DLQI. The SF-36 therefore appears suitable for use in future studies for measuring HRQL, and gender differences in HRQL, in persons with reported hand eczema.","DLQI; Gender; Occupational dermatology; Polychoric correlation; SF-36","article; controlled study; correlation analysis; data analysis; factorial analysis; female; hand eczema; human; instrumentation; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; medical assessment; mental health; occupational eczema; priority journal; quality of life; questionnaire; scoring system; sex difference",,,,,"Stockholms Läns Landsting","We thank Clarie Danielsson for clinical assistance, Gunborg Lindahl for assistance, and Ulrika Andersson for statistical advice and assistance early in the project.

METHODS: We administered the DLQI to 236 out-patients attending our dermatology clinic and results that had been found by those who originated the DLQI, were examined. The reliability and validity of DLQI were assessed by means of reliability analysis and factor analysis. RESULTS: Overall, the DLQI seemed easy to administer and could be completed within 3 minutes. The internal consistency coefficient rates of this unidimensional measure were 0.87 (Cronbach's alpha) and 0.85 (Spearman-brown, s) with high inter-correlations found between the dimensions with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0.4024 - 0.6569. Factor analysis resulted in a unidimensional pattern, which supported the use of a total DLQI-C score. CONCLUSION: DLQI was an easy and efficient instrument for assessing the quality of life in patients with dermatological problems and with better reliability and validity. Thus, it could be used in both research and clinical settings in China.",,"article; eczema; female; human; male; psoriasis; psychological aspect; quality of life; questionnaire; reproducibility; Sickness Impact Profile; skin disease; Eczema; Female; Humans; Male; Psoriasis; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Sickness Impact Profile; Skin Diseases",,,,,,,,,,,"Wang, X.L.",,,,,,,,02546450,,,"15555362","Chinese","Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28744453479

As many as 1% to 5% of patients with acute viral infections involve the myocardium. Although many viruses have been reported to cause myopericarditis, it has been a rare or unrecognized event after vaccination with the currently used strain of vaccinia virus (New York City Board of Health). Objective: To describe a series of probable cases of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination among US military service members reported since the reintroduction of vaccinia vaccine. Design, Setting, Participants: Surveillance case definitions are presented. The cases were identified either through sentinel reporting to US military headquarters surveillance using the Defense Medical Surveillance System or reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision. The cases occurred among individuals vaccinated from mid-December 2002 to March 14, 2003. Main Outcome Measure: Elevated serum levels of creatine kinase (MB isoenzyme), troponin I, and troponin T, usually in the presence of ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram and wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram. Results: Among 230734 primary vaccinees, 18 cases of probable myopericarditis after smallpox vaccination were reported (an incidence of 7.8 per 100000 over 30 days). No cases of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination were reported among 95622 vaccinees who were previously vaccinated. All cases were white men aged 21 years to 33 years (mean age, 26.5 years), who presented with acute myopericarditis 7 to 19 days following vaccination. A causal relationship is supported by the close temporal clustering (7-19 days; mean, 10.5 days following vaccination), wide geographic and temporal distribution, occurrence in only primary vaccinees, and lack of evidence for alternative etiologies or other diseases associated with myopericarditis. Additional supporting evidence is the observation that the observed rate of myopericarditis among primary vaccinees is 3.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 3.33-4.11) higher than the expected rate among personnel who were not vaccinated. The background incidence of myopericarditis did not show statistical significance when stratified by age (20-34 years: 2.18 expected cases per 100000; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90-2.34), race (whites: 1.82 per 100 000; 95% CI, 1.50-2.01), and sex (males: 2.28 per 100 000; 95% CI, 2.04-2.54). Conclusion: Among US military personnel vaccinated against smallpox, myopericarditis occurred at a rate of 1 per 12819 primary vaccinees. Myopericarditis should be considered an expected adverse event associated with smallpox vaccination. Clinicians should consider myopericarditis in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chest pain 4 to 30 days following smallpox vaccination and be aware of the implications as well as the need to report this potential adverse advent.",,"creatine kinase MB;

In a whole-population birth cohort study (n = 1456) we examined prevalence and characteristics of eczema amongst 10-year-old children. At this age 1373 (94%) children completed ISAAC questionnaires, 1043 (72%) skin prick testing and 953 (65%) serum inhalant IgE antibody screening. At 10 years of age prevalence of eczema ever was 41.0% and for current eczema was 13.7% (combined current itchy rash and eczema ever). Most current eczema (71.0%) began before 4 years of age, but was associated with low morbidity at 10 years. Amongst children with diagnosed eczema at 4 years of age, 56.3% had current eczema at 10 years. Atopy (positive skin test) and other allergic states were associated with current eczema (p < 0.001). Risk factor analysis for current eczema identified independent significance for atopy (p = 0.01), rhinitis (p = 0.04) and food allergy (p = 0.01) at 4 years, plus maternal asthma (p = 0.03). Diagnosed rhinitis at 4 years emerged as a significant predictor of persistent disease. Eczema is not simply a transient infantile condition but a common problem at 10 years of age, often reflecting persistent disease from early childhood. Inherited predisposition towards atopy is the predominant risk factor for this state.","Atopic eczema; Atopy; Natural history; Prevalence; Risk factors","immunoglobulin E; atopic dermatitis; atopy; child; cohort analysis; conference paper; disease course; eczema; food allergy; genetic susceptibility; human; major clinical study; mother child relation; prevalence; priority journal; rhinitis; risk assessment; risk factor; Child; Eczema; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Immunoglobulin E; Logistic Models; Male; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Risk Factors",,"immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0; Immunoglobulin E, 37341-29-0",,,,,,,,"Worldwide variation in prevalence of symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and atopic eczema (1998) Lancet, 351, pp. 1225-1232; Kjellman, N.M., Nilsson, L., From food allergy and atopic dermatitis to respiratory allergy (1998) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 9 (SUPPL. 11), pp. 13-17; Determinants of total and specific IgE in infants with atopic dermatitis (1997) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 8, pp. 177-184; Bergmann, R.L., Edenharmer, G., Bergmann, K.E., Atopic dermatitis in early infancy predicts allergic airways disease at 5 years (1998) Clin Exp Allergy, 28, pp. 965-970; Austin, J.B., Kaur, B., Anderson, H.R., Hay fever, eczema, and wheeze: A nationwide UK study (ISAAC, international study of asthma and allergies in childhood) (1999) Arch Dis Child, 81, pp. 225-230; Shamssain, M.H., Shamsian, N., Prevalence severity of asthma, rhinitis, and atopic eczema: The north east study (1999) Arch Dis Child, 81, pp. 313-317; Arshad, S.H., Development of allergic disease in children (1997) Clin Exp Allergy, 27, pp. 1231-1233; Arshad, S.H., Hide, D.W., Effect of environmental factors on the development of allergic disorders in infancy (1992) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 90, pp. 235-241; Arshad, S.H., Stevens, M., Hide, D.W., The effect of genetic and environmental factors on the prevalence of allergic disorders at the age of two years (1993) Clin Exp Allergy, 23, pp. 504-511; Tariq, S.M., Matthews, S.M., Hakim, E.A., Stevens, M., Arshad, S.H., Hide, D.W., The prevalence of and risk factors for atopy in early childhood: A whole population birth cohort study (1998) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 101, pp. 587-593; Kulig, M., Bergmann, R., Wahn, U., Guggenmossholzmann, I., Long-lasting sensitization to food during the first two years precedes allergic airways disease (1998) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 9, pp. 61-67; Burr, M.L., Merrett, T.G., Dunstan, F.D.J., Maguire, M.J., The development of allergy in high-risk children (1997) Clin Exp Allergy, 27, pp. 1247-1253; Kjellmann, B., Hattevig, G., Allergy in early and late onset of atopic dermatitis (1994) Acta Paediatr, 83, pp. 229-231; Linna, O., Kokkonen, J., Lahtela, P., Tammela, O., Ten-year prognosis for generalised eczema (1992) Acta Paediatr, 81, pp. 1013-1016; Cogswell, J.J., Influence of maternal atopy on atopy in the offspring (2000) Clin Exp Allergy, 30, pp. 1-3; Sarafino, E.P., Connections among parent and child atopic illnesses (2000) Pediatr Allergy Immunol, 11, pp. 80-86","Kurukulaaratchy, R.; David Hide Asthma/Allerg.

Epidemiological studies, however, indicate little about its association with climatic factors and air pollution. The relationship between traffic-related air pollutants and allergic rhinitis in middle-school students was therefore investigated. In a nationwide survey of middle-school students in Taiwan conducted in 1995/1996, the lifetime prevalence of physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis and typical symptoms of allergic rhinitis were compared with air-monitoring station data on temperature, relative humidity, sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm (PM10). A total of 331,686 nonsmoking children attended schools located within 2 km of 55 stations. Mean (range) annual exposures were: CO 853 (381-1,610) parts per billion (ppb), NOx 35.1 (10.2-72.4) ppb, SO2 7.57 (0.88-21.2) ppb, PM10 69.2 (40.1-116.2) μg·m-3, O3 21.3 (12.4-34.1) ppb, temperature 22.9 (19.6-25.1)°C, and relative humidity 76.2 (64.8-86.2)%. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis was 28.6 and 19.5% in males and females, respectively, with prevalence of questionnaire-determined allergic rhi nitis 42.4 and 34.0%. After adjustment for age, parental education and history of atopic eczema, physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis was found to be associated with higher nonsummer (September-May) warmth and traffic-related air pollutants, including CO, NOx and O3. Questionnaire-determined allergic rhinitis correlated only with traffic-related air pollutants. Nonsummer warmth and traffic-related air pollution, probably mediated through exposure to common allergens such as dust mites, are possible risk factors for allergic rhinitis in middle-school-aged children.","Air pollution; Allergic rhinitis; Children; Climate; Factor analysis","carbon monoxide; house dust allergen; nitrogen oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; adolescent; air monitoring; air pollutant; air temperature; allergic rhinitis; article; climate; controlled study; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; female; health survey; human; humidity; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; population research; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; school child; sex difference; Taiwan",,"carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; ozone, 10028-15-6; sulfur dioxide, 7446-09-5",,,,,,,,"Lundback, B., Epidemiology of rhinitis and asthma (1998) Clin.

Objective: We examined the effects on infant growth and health of 3 compared with 6 mo of exclusive breastfeeding. Design: We conducted an observational cohort study nested within a large randomized trial in Belarus by comparing 2862 infants exclusively breastfed for 3 mo (with continued mixed breastfeeding through ≥6 mo) with 621 infants who were exclusively breastfed for ≥6 mo. Regression to the mean, within-cluster correlation, and cluster- and individual-level confounding variables were accounted for by using multilevel regression analyses. Results: From 3 to 6 mo, weight gain was slightly greater in the 3-mo group [difference: 29 g/mo (95% CI: 13, 45 g/mo)], as was length gain [difference: 1.1 mm (0.5, 1.6 mm)], but the 6-mo group had a faster length gain from 9 to 12 mo [difference: 0.9 mm/mo (0.3, 1.5 mm/mo)] and a larger head circumference at 12 mo [difference: 0.19 cm (0.07, 0.31 cm)]. A significant reduction in the incidence density of gastrointestinal infection was observed during the period from 3 to 6 mo in the 6-mo group [adjusted incidence density ratio: 0.35 (0.13, 0.96)], but no significant differences in risk of respiratory infectious outcomes or atopic eczema were apparent. Conclusions: Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 mo is associated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal infection and no demonstrable adverse health effects in the first year of life.","Atopic eczema; Breastfeeding; Gastrointestinal infection; Growth; Respiratory infection","article; atopic dermatitis; body height; bottle feeding; breast feeding; child growth; child health; clinical trial; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; correlation analysis; gastrointestinal infection; growth curve; head circumference; human; infant; infection prevention; infection risk; linear regression analysis; multiple regression; normal human; randomized controlled trial; statistical analysis; weight gain; adult; educational status; female; gastrointestinal disease; growth; incidence; male; respiratory tract infection; time; weight gain; Adult; Breast Feeding; Cohort Studies; Educational Status; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Growth; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Respiratory Tract Infections; Time Factors; Weight Gain",,,,,,,,,,"Rowland, M., Barrell, R., Whitehead, R., Bacterial contamination in traditional Gambian weaning foods (1978) Lancet, 1, pp. 136-138; Rowland, M., The weanling's dilemma: Are we making progress?

Unfortunately, head-to-head studies have not been conducted to allow comparisons in treatment efficacy and cost-effectiveness. The study aims to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream as monotherapy for the treatment of AD patients with moderate disease, who are not responsive to or not well-controlled with topical corticosteroids. In the absence of head-to-head comparative data, relative treatment efficacy was estimated based on existing outcomes, which were reported in the published literature and data from clinical trials. Comparisons were made between Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores and converted to disease-controlled days (DCDs) on treatment. Other assumptions about resource utilization, changes in management and patient outcomes were based on opinions of a physician panel and from previously published reports. Medical resources costs were derived from fee schedules and product average wholesale prices (AWPs). A Markov model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness ratios for each treatment. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for key variables to assess their impact on the results. Study designs and efficacy endpoints differed between tacrolimus and pimecrolimus clinical studies. In tacrolimus studies, a quantitative physician global assessment was performed, which tracked percentage improvement relative to baseline. In contrast, pimecrolimus studies relied on investigator global assessments scored on a Likert scale. Studies of both agents used the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). A comparison of EASI scores for tacrolimus and pimecrolimus found that pimecrolimus was approximately 60% as efficacious as tacrolimus after 2 to 4 weeks of treatment. Based on these efficacy rates, average cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated at $7. 34 per DCD for tacrolimus and $11.34 per DCD for pimecrolimus. Sensitivity analyses found that pimecrolimus would only be cost-effective if its efficacy approached 90% of tacrolimus efficacy or if the costs of the products were significantly different than current AWPs. Although head-to-head comparative studies have not been completed to date, there are likely to be differences in efficacy between topical immunomodulators. Based on published data, we estimate that the efficacy of pimecrolimus to be 60% of the efficacy of tacrolimus and therefore, tacrolimus to be more cost-effective for the treatment of moderate AD. Sensitivity analyses revealed that pimecrolimus cream would need to be 90% as efficacious as tacrolimus ointment in order to be cost-effective in this patient population.Results:A comparison of change in EASI scores over the first 4 weeks of treatment showed that relative to vehicle controls, Tac reduced EASI scores significantly more than Elidel. At week 2, Elidel EASI differences were 65% compared to Tac (-4.4 versus -6.8); at week 4, EASI differences were 61% (-5.5 versus -9.0). The efficacy of Tac (75% improvement rates) was found to be 36% at week 2 and 52% at week 4. Using the relative EASI scores for both agents, the imputed efficacy rates for Elidel were calculated to be 23% at week 2, and 32% at week 4. Tac patients achieved greater disease control compared to Elidel patients (53% versus 39%) and spent less time on primary therapy (42% versus 54%). Total 1-year costs were lower for patients receiving Tac than for those receiving Elidel ($1,393 versus $1,550, respectively). Primary drug costs were higher for Tac due to differences between average wholesale prices (Tac: $797 versus Elidel: $786). However, Elidel patients incurred greater costs on secondary treatment (Elidel: $236 versus Tac: $162), as well as higher physicians' costs (Elidel: $529 versus Tac: $434). Elidel patients incurred higher costs because they did not achieve comparable rates of disease control, and more Elidel patients were likely to require continuous physician management and ended up on secondary therapy. Total efficacy as measured by DCDs was significantly higher for Tac (190 DCDs) compared to Elidel (137 DCDs). The average cost-effectiveness ratio of Tac was $7.34 per DCD compared to $11.34 per DCD for Elidel. Higher efficacy rates for Elidel yielded better cost-effectiveness ratios. A sensitivity analysis of the efficacy of Elidel relative to Tac found that Elidel would be cost-effective if its efficacy approached 90% of that of Tac.Indications:403 patients with atopic dermatitis.Patients:754 patients, aged 2-17 years. Elidel group: n=403, aged 2-17 years. Tac group: n=351, aged 2-15 years.TypeofStudy:The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus (Tac) ointment and Elidel cream as monotherapy for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients with moderate disease, who are not responsive to or not well-controlled with topical corticosteroids was evaluated. Randomized, double-blind, vehicle- controlled study.DosageDuration:Dosage not stated (as cream). Duration: 6 weeks blinded followed by 20 weeks open label.AdverseEffects:No adverse events were mentioned.AuthorsConclusions:A review of existing studies indicates that tacrolimus ointment may be considered to be more potent than pimecrolimus cream for the treatment of moderate AD. Sensitivity analyses revealed that pimecrolimus cream would need to be 90% as efficacious as tacrolimus ointment in order to be cost-effective in this patient population. This study provides a framework to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of these two agents in light of assumptions made about relative cost and efficacy.FreeText:This study defined treatment success as disease-controlled days (DCD). DCDs represented days in which patients did not require primary prescription topical therapy. Comparisons were made between Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores and converted to DCDs on treatment. To compare the relative efficacy of Tac and Elidel, the following calculations were made to impute the disease control rate for Elidel: (1) For Elidel, data that compared EASI scores of Elidel compared to vehicle in a pediatric population was utilized. (2) For Tac, the mean change in EASI scores during the first month treatment was abstracted for clinical study reports in pediatric patients for consistency. These values were compared to EASI scores for the vehicle group and differences between EASI scores were calculated. The ratio of Elidel EASI scores compared with vehicle, relative to Tac EASI scores compared with vehicle, was applied to the efficacy rate of Tac to estimate the efficacy rate for Elidel. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the third-party payer perspective over 52 weeks. Published fee schedules and prices were utilized to standardize all health care cost estimates, adjusted to the 2002 value of the US dollar. Cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated using a Markov model to represent the cyclical, recursive nature of AD. The base case Markov analysis was performed using initial data inputs from a literature review and physician panel opinion. Subsequently, sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of changing certain variables in the model. The model software utilized was DATA, version 3.5 (Treeage Software; Williamstown, MA). Both treatment groups incorporated three alternative Markov states: Primary treatment in which patients were treated either with Tac or Elidel. Secondary treatment in which patients who discontinued primary therapy could be treated with second-line therapies for 4 weeks at a time. Disease-controlled, prescription-free treatment in which the disease was well- controlled and was not actively treated with prescription pharmaceuticals for 4 weeks at a time. After every 2 weeks of primary treatment, if patients experienced disease control, they transitioned to a disease-controlled, prescription-free state. If they did not achieve disease control after 4 consecutive weeks, they could have transitioned to secondary therapy (defined as midpotency steroids and antibiotics) or could have continued on primary therapy. Secondary therapy is regarded as maintenance therapy, with no patients achieving disease control. Cost of treatment analysis focused on prescription drug and physician costs. Primary treatment costs were based on published average wholesale prices (AWP) as of September 2002. Resource utilization and changes in management were based on the opinions of the physician authors and from previously published reports. Treatment success was defined as disease control as defined in previous studies, whereby patients showed a greater than 75% improvement on baseline disease, based on physician global assessment. Success rates for Elidel were estimated based on comparisons of EASI scores described above. Other transition probabilities included efficacy rates for secondary therapy (0% after 4 weeks of treatment), and relapse rates following treatment success (50% after 4 weeks), which were determined solely by the physician panel. Relapse rate following the disease-controlled, prescription-free state was set at 50% after 4 weeks, with half of all patients continuing to be controlled while the other half were re-treated with the primary therapy. Variations in relapse rates were subjected to sensitivity analyses. The model assumed that both Tac and Elidel patients used the same number of grams per day (equivalent to 17.5 g/week). Furthermore, the model evaluated treatments, costs and outcomes over 52 weeks.","Atopic dermatitis; Cost-effectiveness; Topical immunomodulators","corticosteroid; immunomodulating agent; pimecrolimus;

Methods: In a whole population birth cohort study (n = 1456) the prevalence and characteristics of rhinitis among 10-y-old children were examined. At this age 1373 children (94%) completed standardized questionnaires, 1043 (72%) skin-prick testing, 953 (65%) serum inhalant immunoglobulin E antibody screening and 784 (54%) methacholine bronchial challenges. Results: At the age of 10 y the prevalence of hayfever ever was 18.6% and current nasal symptoms (rhinitis) 22.6%. Rhinitis at 10 y was largely seasonal and associated with low morbidity, although 62.7% of cases required pharmacological treatment. Atopy (positive skin test) and other allergic states were associated with rhinitis (p &lt; 0.001). Wheeze or diagnosed asthma was higher with coexistent rhinitis. Among wheezing children physician-diagnosed asthma (p &lt; 0.024) and inhaled corticosteroid use (p &lt; 0.001) were greater with the presence of rhinitis. Significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness (methacholine concentration giving a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s &lt;4.0 mg ml-1) was greater if rhinitis was present even when the child did not wheeze (p &lt; 0.001). Risk factor analysis for rhinitis identified the independent significance for atopy (p &lt; 0.001) and eczema (p = 0.009) at the age of 4 y plus paternal rhinitis (p &lt; 0.001), maternal rhinitis (p = 0.033) and maternal food allergy (p = 0.016). Conclusion: Rhinitis is common at the age of 10y, with strong associations with atopy, wheezing, asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. An inherited predisposition towards atopy appears to predominate over environment in the aetiology of this state.","Asthma; Atopy; Childhood rhinitis; Prevalence; Risk factors","antibody screening; article; asthma; atopy; bronchus hyperreactivity; child; early diagnosis; female; forced expiratory volume; human; major clinical study; male; prevalence; prick test; priority journal; rhinitis; risk factor",,,,,,,,,,"Worldwide variation in prevalence of symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and atopic eczema (1998) Lancet, 351, pp. 1225-1232; Wright, A.L., Holberg, J., Martinez, F.D., Halonen, M., Morgan, W., Taussig, L.M., Epidemiology of physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis (1994) Pediatrics, 94, pp. 895-901; Fleming, D.M., Crombie, D.L., Prevalence of asthma and hayfever in England and Wales (1987) Br Med J, 294, pp. 279-283; Lundback, B., Epidemiology of rhinitis and asthma (1998) Clin Exp Allergy, 28 (SUPPL. 2), pp. 3-10; Austin, J.B., Kaur, B., Anderson, H.R., Burr, M., Leigh, M., Harkins, L.S., Hay fever, eczema, and wheeze: A nationwide UK study (ISAAC, international study of asthma and allergies in childhood) (1999) Arch Dis Child, 81, pp. 225-230; Shamssain, M.H., Shamsian, N., Prevalence and severity of asthma, rhinitis, and atopic eczema: The north east study (1999) Arch Dis Child, 81, pp. 313-317; Arshad, S.H., Development of allergic disease in children (1997) Clin Exp Allergy, 27, pp. 1231-1233; Ramsdale, E.H., Morris, M.M., Roberts, R.S., Hargreave, F.E., Asymptomatic bronchial hyperresponsiveness in rhinitis (1985) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 75, pp. 573-577; Braman, S.S., Barrows, A.A., DeCotiis, B.A., Settipane, G.A., Corrao, W.M., Airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic rhinitis.

Aim: To define the descriptive epidemiology of otitis externa in the general population, to describe the first-line drug treatment used by UK GPs, and to determine factors related to second disease episodes. Design of study: Epidemiological data survey. Setting: All cases of otitis externa occurring in 1997 in practices contributing data to the UK General Practice Research Database Method: Data were extracted on age, sex, date of episode of otitis externa, treatment prescribed, co-existing diagnoses of eczema and diabetes, referral to ear, nose, and throat departments and occurrence of subsequent episodes of disease. Arbitrarily a second episode of disease was defined as persistence if it occurred at 28 days or fewer after the first episode and recurrence if it occurred at more than 28 days after the first episode. Results: A diagnosis of otitis externa was common in all age groups and, except in the elderly, was more common in females than males. There was an increase in disease episodes at the end of the summer in all age groups except the 60 years and over group. In the majority of cases GPs prescribed ear drops (85%), but a significant proportion of patients were also prescribed oral antibiotics (21%). Referral to secondary care was uncommon (3%). Among patients prescribed ear-drop formulations, those containing both steroid and antibiotic or steroid alone were used most commonly and were associated with the lower rates of disease persistence but not recurrence. Among patients prescribed antibiotics, penicillins were prescribed most commonly. Disease persistence rates, and to a lesser extent disease recurrence rates, were higher in patients prescribed oral antibiotics. Conclusion: Otitis externa is a common condition and GPs can expect to see an excess of cases at the end of the summer. Topical ear drops are the most common treatment used in the UK. Patients prescribed steroid or steroid/antibiotic combination ear drops have fewer subsequent consultations for otitis externa over the following 28 days.","Drug therapy; Epidemiology; Otitis externa; Prescriptions; Referral","aluminum acetate; amoxicillin; antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; astringent agent; azithromycin; betamethasone; betamethasone sodium phosphate plus neomycin; cephalosporin derivative; chloramphenicol; clarithromycin; clioquinol plus flumethasone; clotrimazole; cotrimoxazole; dexamethasone; ear drops; erythromycin; flucloxacillin; gentamicin; hydrocortisone plus gentamicin; hydrocortisone plus neomycin plus polymyxin; macrolide; penicillin G derivative; penicillin V; prednisolone; steroid; tetracycline derivative; triamcinolone; triamcinolone plus neomycin; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; adolescent; adult; age; aged; article; child; consultation; controlled study; data base; diabetes mellitus; disease duration; drug formulation; drug use; eczema; epidemiological data; external otitis; factorial analysis; female; general practice; health survey; high risk population; hospital department; human; major clinical study; male; medical research; patient care; patient referral; persistent infection; prescription; prevalence; recurrent infection; seasonal variation; sex difference; summer; treatment outcome; United Kingdom; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Diabetes Complications; Drug Therapy, Combination; Eczema; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Otitis Externa; Physician's Practice Patterns; Prevalence; Recurrence; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Seasons; Sex Distribution; Steroids",,"Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Steroids",,,,,,,,"Walley, T., Mantgani, A., The UK general practice research database (1997) Lancet, 350, p. 1099; (1996) Key Health Statistics from General Practice, , London: The Stationery Office; Nazareth, I., King, M., Haines, A., Accuracy of diagnosis of psychosis on general practice computer system (1993) BMJ, 307, pp. 32-34; Van Staa, T.P., Abenhaim, L., The quality of information recorded on a UK database of primary care recores: A study of hospitalization due to hypoglycaemia and other conditions (1994) Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf, 3, pp. 15-21; Hollowell, J., The General Practice Research Database: Quality of morbidity data (1997) Population Trends, 87, pp. 36-40; Hansell, A., Hollowell, J., Nichols, T., Use of the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) for respiratory epidemiology: A comparison with the 4th Morbidity Survey in General Practice (MSGP4) (1999) Thorax, 54, pp. 413-419; Halpern, M.T., Palmer, C.S., Seidlin, M., Treatment patterns for otitis externa (1999) J Am Board Fam Pract, 12, pp. 1-7; Agius, A.M., Pickles, J.M., Burch, K.L., A prospective study of otitis externa (1992) Clin Otolaryngol, 17, pp. 150-154; Russell, J.D., Donnelly, M., McShane, D.P., What causes acute otitis externa?

Instruments for qualitative registration of these central nervous factors and evaluation of therapeutic measures are still missing. We analyzed in detail the subjective itch sensation in 108 patients with acute atopic eczema with a new questionnaire developed in analogy to the McGill pain questionnaire. The descriptors with the highest load in atopic itch and the most frequent reaction patterns in atopic eczema patients were identified. Itch intensity (mean VAS 62%) and eczema severity (SCORAD mean 41 points) showed a different frequency distribution pattern with a correlation of r = 0.33 (p < 0.05). Principal component analysis of the itch questionnaire data was performed and compared with the standardized SCORAD severity index for the patients with atopic eczema. Three main factors of atopic itch explained 58% of the total variance: (1) 'suffering' (correlation with SCORAD, r = 0.6); (2) 'phasic intensity' (correlation with SCORAD, r = 0.4), and (3) 'ecstatic' component (associated with certain active reaction patterns). In conclusion, the complete description of itch has to consider different factors, which may be described on a more general level by three main components. Two of these are correlated with objective criteria of disease activity. Copyright © 2001 S.

It is easy to diagnose and treatment is both well categorised and effective. The aim of this study was to combine epidemiological information about this disorder to better direct the struggle to combat it. This was a transverse, descriptive study performed between 8 January 1997 and 12 May 1997 in primary schools from the town of Ouagadougou. Sampling was performed using the cluster analysis method. The study involved 4,485 school children. Scabies was diagnosed on a clinical basis and only classical cases were registered. The influence of age, level of hygiene, socio-economic status, promiscuity, and type of school were determined. Superinfection and eczematous changes were the two complications which were searched for. The overall prevalence rate was 6.1 %. The prevalence rate by sex was 6.9 % for boys and 5.3 % for girls. Average age of the affected children was 10.2 years old, with a range from 4 to 17 years old. The sex ratio (M/W) = 1.3. Prevalence increased with age and varied depending on the class level, occurring more commonly in public schools (6.4 %) than in private schools (5.6 %). Scabies occurred more frequently in peripheral and/or populous areas, in certain primary inspections in towns and in children coming from low socio-economic groups with poor clothing hygiene. Areas affected in decreasing order of frequency were the buttocks, inter-digital spaces, periumbilical region, elbows and knees. Thirty four point eight per cent of our cases of scabies were complicated (27.8 % were superinfected and 7 % had become eczematous). Complications occurred more in children with poor body hygiene, poor clothing hygiene (particularly eczematous changes: 100 %) and less privileged classes. Complications occurred more frequently in treated scabies patients. Infection appears to occur usually in the family environment. Despite the prevalence under-estimate because of the diagnostic criteria used to define scabies (clinical and epidemiological), our study shows the prevalence to be high compared to certain African studies. Our results are similar to those of BÈnin (7.4 %). It should be stressed that scabies is endemic in our countries, occurring at varying frequencies over time and space. Our study confirms published findings, indicating that scabies occurs more frequently in boys, and particularly infects children around the age of 10, shortly before puberty. It remains the scourge of under-privileged socio-economic groups and those living under poor hygiene conditions.","Burkina Faso; Child; Scabies","adolescent; age; Burkina Faso; child; eczema; endemic disease; female; high risk population; human; hygiene; infestation; major clinical study; male; prevalence; primary school; review; risk factor; sex ratio; social status; superinfection",,,,,,,,,,"Bobin, P., Dermatologie géographique.

It frequently starts in the first year of life. There is agreement on the existence of psychological influences on this disease. Although some studies in this field examine aspects of the parent-child relationship, studies concerning early infancy are very rare. The present study was conducted in order to find out whether maternal characteristics relevant to the mother-infant relationship, i.e. depressiveness/hopelessness, child-rearing attitudes and perceived infant behaviour, associated with infant AD. Methods: Two cohorts (3- to 4-month- and 10- to 12-month-old infants), each with 20 infants suffering from AD, and 20 healthy infants were recruited. AD infants were further divided into subgroups according to the diagnostic criteria: atopic family history, itching and characteristic locations of eczema. After a paediatric examination of the infant, mothers completed standardized questionnaires concerning depressiveness/hopelessness, child-rearing attitudes and perception of infant behaviour. Results: Varying with different diagnostic features of the infants' AD, mothers of AD infants described themselves as more depressive/hopeless, as more anxious/overprotective and characterized their infant as less frequently positive and more frequently negative in its emotional behaviour compared to the control group. Conclusion: The results underline the importance of psychological support for mothers of infants with AD.","Atopic eczema; Child-rearing attitudes; Maternal depressiveness; Mother-infant relationship;

Purpose: To construct and validate the first dermatology-specific instrument in French. Methods: Items were generated from the interview of patients. The final self-administered questionnaire, the VQ-Dermato, included 28 questions. Validity in terms of content and construct, reliability in terms of reproducibility and internal consistency, responsiveness and acceptability were tested in a population of 231 patients with 12 categories of chronic skin disorders, who were recruited and followed in hospital and private practice in France. Results: Item analysis revealed that discrimination indices were high. After factor analysis, 7 dimensions were retained, which accounted for 72% of the total variance. Cronbach's α coefficient ranged between 0.67 and 0.88. A strong correlation was found between dimensions of the VQ-Dermato and the corresponding dimensions of the SF36. Scores were significantly different in each category of chronic skin disease and significantly higher when there was a function restriction or when the lesions were visible to others. The scale was proven to be stable by test-retest correlation. The VQ-Dermato was more responsive to clinical improvement after a 1- or 2-month treatment than the SF36. The percentage of missing responses was under 10 and the time for completing the questionnaire always under 13 min. Conclusion: The VQ-Dermato is the first valid and reliable dermatology-specific QoL instrument in French, and the first based on the concept of 'chronic skin disorders'. It is acceptable for routine use and has a better responsiveness than a general health instrument.","Eczema; Handicap; Leg ulcer; Psoriasis; Psychology; Quality of life; Skin disorders","adult; article; disease severity; emotional stability; female; hospital; human; interview; major clinical study; male; mental health; pain; physical capacity; priority journal; private practice; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; reproducibility; skin disease; social interaction; statistical analysis",,,,,,,,,,"Johnston, M.L., Roberts, J., Prevalence morbidity and cost of dermatological diseases (1979) J Invest Dermatol, 73, pp. 395-401; Ware, J.E., Sherboume, C.D., The MOS 36-item short-form health survey (SF36) (1992) Med J Care, 30, pp. 437-483; Hunt, S.M., McEvent, McKenna, S.P., (1986) Measuring Health Status, , London, Croom Helm; Finlay, A.Y., Quality of life measurement in dermatology: A practical guide (1997) Br J Dermatol, 136, pp. 305-314; Finlay, A.Y., Coles, E.C., The effect of severe psoriasis on the quality of life of 369 patients (1995) Br J Dermatol, 132, pp. 236-244; Berth-Jones, J., Finlay, A.Y., Zaki, I., Tan, B., Goodyear, H., Lewis-Jones, S., Cork, M.J., Graham-Brown, R.A., Cyclosporine in severe childhood atopic dermatitis: A multicenter study (1996) J Am Acad Dermatol, 34, pp. 1016-1021; Motley, R.J., Finlay, A.Y., How much disability is caused by acne?

We assessed the distribution of the severity of atopic eczema in the community and investigated differences between east and west Germany. A factor analysis was then carried out to characterize the variables of this scoring system and to analyse possible relationships within them. A multicentre cross-sectional study was carried out in five east German and two west German locations in 1994; pre-school children (5-6 years old) were investigated and cases of atopic eczema identified by a dermatological examination. The SCORAD was used to determine the severity of atopic eczema and the results assessed using analysis of variance and principal component analysis (varimax rotation). In all, 1511 (76.2%) of the children originally contacted participated and 11.3% were diagnosed with atopic eczema at the time of examination. The median severity score was 21.4 (interquartile range 13.5) and there was a tendency to higher scores in west Germany for the mean overall score, the intensity score and the extent. 'Erythema' (1.30 vs. 1.06: P=0.006) and 'excoriation' (0.77 vs. 0.36; P=0.002) were significantly more prominent in children with eczema from west Germany (adjusted for observer). Interobserver variabilities of the SCORAD parameters were calculated, adjusted for location and were in accordance with earlier findings. Principal component analysis identified three independent factors accounting for 54.1% of the total variance. A severity factor, characterized by 'extent', 'lichenification', 'excoriation' and 'pruritus', was separated from a factor with an acute eczema-type profile ('erythema', 'oedema', 'oozing') and a factor whose major characteristics were 'extent', 'dryness', and 'sleep loss'. We conclude that atopic eczema is frequent in pre-school children. The SCORAD proved to be readily applicable and useful in epidemiological studies, but further validation is needed.",,"article; atopic dermatitis; disease severity; factorial analysis; germany; human; major clinical study; preschool child; priority journal; scoring system; Analysis of Variance; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Germany; Humans; Observer Variation; Prevalence; Severity of Illness Index",,,,,,,,,,"Schultz-Larsen, F., Hanifin, J., Secular change in the occurrence of atopic dermatitis (1992) Acta Derm Venereol (Stockh), 176 (71 SUPPL.), pp. 7-12; Ninan, T., Russell, G., Respiratory symptoms and atopy in Aberdeen schoolchildren: Evidence from two surveys 25 years apart (1992) Br Med J, 304, pp. 873-875; Schultz-Larsen, F., The epidemiology of atopic dermatitis (1995) Epidemiology of Clinical Allergy, pp. 9-28. , (Burr M. ed.).

With the increase in prevalence of atopic diseases in recent years, especially among children, a great deal of attention has been given to environmental causes. In a study of 1480 Swedish twin pairs, 7-9 years old, we examined the importance of genetic and environmental factors in asthma, hay fever, eczema, and urticaria. Structural equation model fitting showed 33-76% of the variation in liability to the diseases to be due to genetic effects. Shared environmental effects were also important for hay fever and urticaria in both sexes and for eczema among girls. The clustering of atopic disease in families was almost entirely due to a common set of genes, but each disease manifestation also seemed to have specific genes of importance. Investigation of unlike-sex twins showed that boys had a higher cumulative incidence of asthma and hay fever than girls, whereas girls had a higher incidence of eczema. Thus, it may be concluded that although genetic factors are of major importance in atopic manifestation in children, both environmental and sex-related factors play a role.","Asthma; Atopy; Eczema; Environment; Genes; Hay fever; Twins; Urticaria","article; asthma; atopy; eczema; environmental factor; female; genetic analysis; hay fever; heredity; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; school child; sex difference; Sweden; twins; urticaria",,,,,,,,,,"Coca, A.F., Cooke, R.A., On the classification of the phenomena of hypersensitiveness (1923) J Immunol, 8, pp. 162-183; Edfors-Lubs, M.-L., Allergy in 7,000 twin pairs (1971) Acta Allergol, 26, pp. 249-285; Duffy, D.L., Martin, N.G., Battistutta, D., Hopper, J.L., Mathews, J.D., Genetics of asthma and hay fever in Australian twins (1990) Am Rev Respir Dis, 142, pp. 1351-1358; Hopp, R.J., Bewtra, A.K., Watt, G.D., Nair, N.M., Townley, R.G., Genetic analysis of allergic disease in twins (1984) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 73, pp. 265-270; Hopper, J.L., Hannah, M.C., Macaskill, G.T., Mathews, J.D., Twin concordance for a binary trait.

Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of allergen sensitization and family history of atopy on asthma and allergic disease in Chinese schoolchildren from three southeast Asian populations. Methods: Written questionnaires on respiratory and allergic symptoms were completed by parents of children of secondary-school age (age range 12 to 18 years) in Hong Kong (n = 1062), Kota Kinabalu in eastern Malaysia (n = 409), and San Bu in southern China (n = 737). A subsample of school-children underwent skin prick testing to common inhalant allergens (Hong Kong 471 children, Kota Kinabalu 321+ San Bu 647). Results: The prevalence of asthma and allergic disease in schoolchildren was highest in Hong Kong, intermediate in Kota Kinabalu, and lowest in San Bu. However, the overall rate of atopic sensitization was similar in the three population (49% to 63%). House dust mite and cockroach were the two most common allergens causing sensitization and these gave rise to more than 95% of the positive skin test results in all three populations. By regression analysis, mite allergy was associated with rhinitis and asthma in all three populations, and a family history of asthma, rhinitis, or eczema was strongly associated with respective symptoms in the subjects. After adjusting for age, sex, atopic status, and family history of allergic disease, the place of residence remained a significant independent factor for asthma (odds ratio [OR] = 1.0 for Hong Kong, 0.57 for Kota Kinabalu, 0.15 for San Bu, p < 0.001), rhinitis (OR = 1.0 for Hong Kong, 0.59 for Kota Kinabalu, 0.15 for San Bu, p < 0.001), or eczema (OR = 1.0 for Hong Kong, 0.35 for Kota Kinabalu, 1.01 for San Bu, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Sensitization to indoor allergens was a significant risk factor for asthma and allergic disease, and familial clustering of disease was common in the region. However, the marked difference in disease prevalence in the three southeast Asian populations of Chinese schoolchildren cannot be explained by atopic sensitization and family history alone, and the place of residence was an independent risk factor for asthma and allergies, which suggests an important environmental role in disease pathogenesis.","allergy;

Design: Cross-sectional and longitudinal questionnaire study. Setting: Dermatology clinic of a Veterans Affairs hospital and private dermatology practices. Patients: Patients waiting for dermatology appointments: 201 patients responded to the original version of Skindex and 692 additional patients to the revised version. Main Outcome Measures: Reproducibility, internal consistency reliability, and validity of the revised version of Skindex. The revised version was compared with the original in 3 ways: the amount of time patients need to complete it; discriminative capability, determined as the number of items to which patients chose the same response; and evaluative capability, determined as the number of scales that were responsive to patients' reports of clinical change. Results: With the revised 29-item version of Skindex, scale scores were reproducible after 72 hours (r=0.88-0.92) and were internally reliable (Cronbach α=0.87-0.96). The instrument demonstrated both construct and content validity: patients with psoriasis and eczema responded with higher scores than those with isolated lesions; in an exploratory principal axes factor analysis with an oblique rotation, 97% of the common variance was explained by 3 factors that correlated with the a priori scales; and most patients' responses to an open-ended question about their skin disease were addressed by items in the instrument. The average time to complete the revised instrument was 5 minutes (compared with 15 minutes for the original version). For only 3 items (10%) did 70% or more of patients choose the same response (vs 17 [28%] of items in the original, version). All scales changed significantly in the expected direction in patients who reported that their skin had changed after 3 months (vs only 3 of 8 scales originally). Conclusion: The 29-item version of Skindex remains reliable and valid, but has decreased respondent burden and improved discriminative and evaluative capability.",,"adult; aged; article; eczema; human; major clinical study; measurement; priority journal; psoriasis; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; reproducibility; scoring system; skin disease",,,,,"National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS: K08AR001962",,,,,"Chren, M.M., Lasek, R.J., Quinn, L.M., Mostow, E.N., Zyzanski, S.J., Skindex, a quality-of-life measure for patients with skin disease: Reliability, validity, and responsiveness (1996) J Invest Dermatol., 107, pp. 707-713; Chren, M.M., Lasek, R.J., Quinn, L.M., Covinsky, K.E., Convergent and discriminant validity of a generic and a disease-specific instrument to measure quality of life in patients with skin disease (1997) J Invest Dermatol., 108, pp. 103-107; Chren, M.M., Lasek, R.J., Skindex 1.1: Reliability, validity, and responsiveness of a refined instrument to measure the effects of skin disease on quality of life (1997) J Invest Dermatol., 108, p. 366. , Abstract; Kirshner, B., Guyatt, G., A methodological framework for assessing health indices (1985) J Chronic Dis., 38, pp. 27-36; Guyatt, G.H., Kirshner, B., Jaeschke, R., Measuring health status: What are the necessary measurement properties?

A screening questionnaire on respiratory symptoms was applied to 4003 children attending primary schools in Aberdeen, after which 799 symptomatic children and a random selection of 229 asymptomatic children were invited to attend for a diagnostic interview. Six hundred and seven (359 boys and 248 girls) symptomatic children and 135 asymptomatic children (57 boys and 78 girls) were selected from the screening questionnaires. Of 607 children with respiratory symptoms when interviewed, 27 (nine boys and 18 girls) had isolated PNC, and 97 (51 boys and 46 girls) had multiple symptoms (polysymptomatic asthma). The incidence of prematurity was highest in the group with PNC (19%). The prevalence of hay fever in children with PNC (11%) was similar to that of the asymptomatic group (15%) and less than that in the group with polysymptomatic asthma (41%). Eczema was twice as common in the PNC (19%) as in the asymptomatic children (10%) but only half as common in the polysymptomatic asthma group (35%). The prevalence of a parental history of hay fever was similar in all three groups. The prevalence of a parental history of eczema was similar in the PNC (7%) and asymptomatic (7%) groups but higher in the polysymptomatic asthma group (22%). The prevalence of a history of parental asthma was 30% in children with PNC, 13% in the asymptomatic group, and 42% in those with polysymptomatic asthma. The parents of three (1 1%) children with PNC were aware of a diagnosis of asthma; two of these children (7%) were on inhaled bronchodilator treatment and one (4%) was on a slow release theophylline preparation. Using a stepwise discriminant analysis procedure, in 18 (67%) children with PNC predicted membership was in the asymptomatic group and only nine (33%) children with PNC were grouped into the polysymptomatic asthma category. It is concluded that the clinical features of children with PNC resembled those of the asymptomatic population more closely than those of the polysymptomatic asthmatic population. In this age group PNC, in the absence of wheeze, shortness of breath or tightness in the chest, is likely to be a manifestation of atypical or hidden asthma in only a minority of cases.","Asthma; Parental atopy; Persistent nocturnal cough","marker; article; asthma; atopy; child; controlled study; coughing; female; human; major clinical study; male; parent; priority journal; questionnaire; symptom; Asthma; Bronchodilator Agents; Child; Cough; Cross-Sectional Studies; Discriminant Analysis; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity, Immediate; Male; Parents; Sex Factors; Tobacco Smoke Pollution",,"Bronchodilator Agents; Tobacco Smoke Pollution",,,,,,,,,"Ninan, T.K.; Arrowe Park Hospital, Arrowe Park Road, Upton, Wirral, Merseyside LA9 5PE, United Kingdom",,,"BMJ Publishing Group",,,,,00039888,,ADCHA,"8554355","English","Arch.

A cross‐sectional, population‐based study among schoolchildren aged 6–14 years was conducted in Al‐Ain City, UAE. The field survey was conducted from October 1992 to May 1993. A questionnaire was distributed to 850 UAE government school students from representative, randomly selected schools with a majority of UAE nationals. The student and both or either of the parents were present during the interview. A detailed clinical history of asthma and wheezing in the target children and a history of asthma and allergic rhinitis in their parents and siblings were obtained. It was found that 13.1% of asthmatic children had mothers with asthma (relative risk (RR) = 2.67; 95% confidence intervals (CI)= 1.65–4.35), and 15.2% had fathers who were asthmatic (RR = 2.85; 95% CI = 1.81–4.49). This contrasted with 4.4% of nonasthmatic children who had fathers with asthma, and 4.1% who had mothers with asthma. A similar pattern was seen with symptoms of allergic rhinitis when it was found that 34.3% of children who had asthma had mothers with allergic rhinitis (RR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.90–3.94). The corresponding figure for fathers was 12.7% (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.5–1.7). The frequency of either parent of the asthmatic children having allergic rhinitis was 28.6%; for both parents, it was 14.5%. It was also found that asthmatic children had 12.5% of their fathers, 32.8% of their mothers, 26.4% of either of their parents, and 33.3% of both their parents suffering from allergic rhinitis. Siblings of the asthmatic children were also studied to establish the relationship between allergic conditions in the siblings and asthma in the study sample. It was found that in the asthmatic study population the frequency of siblings having asthma was 31.9%; of those having allergic rhinitis, 21.3%; and of those having eczema, 16.1%. Twenty‐nine percent of either of the parents of the children with eczema had the same condition, and the corresponding figure for allergic rhinitis was 36.5%. The prevalence rate of asthma in the schoolchildren studied increased dramatically to 22% when wheeze, asthma, or nocturnal cough were grouped together. When eczema and allergic rhinitis were also considered together along with the above, the rate increased to 31%. The size of the family did not seem to affect the parent/child association of allergic symptoms. Our findings indicate that there is a strong association between respiratory allergies and eczema in parents and in their asthmatic children, thereby indicating a strong genetic basis for the occurrence of asthma in particular and atopy in general.

As a result, several measures of the disabilities and handicaps associated with psoriasis have been developed. The Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI) has been shown to be sensitive to changes in the extent of lesions and to co‐vary with the Sickness Impact Profile, a more general measure of the effects of disease on quality of life. In this study, patients with psoriasis and patients with other skin diseases completed the PDI. Although most items on the PDI were specific to psoriasis, some items applied to patients with urticaria, eczema, melanomas and other skin diseases. A factor analysis of the items indicated that the PDI contained two subscales, one concerning most aspects of everyday activities, the other concerning specific public situations such as the use of communal facilities.

Assessment methods for atopic dermatitis (AD) are not standardized. and therapeutic studies are difficult to interpret. Aims. To obtain a consensus on assessment methods in AD and to use a statistical method to develop a composite severity index.Methods. Consensus definitions were given for items used in the scoring system (extent, intensity, subjective) and illustrated for intensity items. Slides were reviewed to address within- and between-observer variability by a group of 10 trained clinicians, and data were statistically evaluated with a two-way analysis of variance. Two variants of an assessment system were compared in 88 patients at 5 different institutions. Data were analyzed using principal-component analysis. Results. For 5 intensity items studied (erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crusts, excoriations, lichenification), within- and between-observer variability was good overall, except for edema/papulation which was difficult to assess with slides. In the series of 88 patients, principal-component analysis allowed to extract two unrelated components: the first one accounting for 33% of total variance was interpreted as a ‘severity’ component; the second one, accounting for 18% of variance, was interpreted as a ‘profile’ component distinguishing patients with mostly erythema and subjective symptoms and those with mostly lichenification and dryness and lower subjective symptoms. Of the two evaluation systems used, the one using the rule of nine to assess extent was found more workable than the one using a distribution × intensity product. A scoring index (SCORAD) combining extent, severity and subjective symptoms was mathematically derived from the first system and showed a normal distribution of the population studied. Conclusion. The final choice for the evaluation system was mostly made based on simplicity and easy routine use in outpatient clinics. Based on mathematical appreciation of weights of the items used in the assessment of AD. extent and subjective symptoms account for around 20% each of the total score, intensity items representing 60%. The so-designed composite index SCORAD needs to be further tested in clinical trials. © 1993 S.

Mean areas of weals formed by individual allergens were adjusted by analysis of covariance for age, sex, and atopic background (past or present atopic dermatitis including infantile eczema). Adjusted mean weal areas for almost all allergens, except pollens and few other allergens, were significantly larger in farmers than in non-farming controls. In contrast, only skin reactions to cow dander, to a non-dialyzed crude preparation of fodder yeast Candida utilis, and to Candida albicans distinguished symptomatic subjects from asymptomatic ones. Stepwise discriminant analysis, in which reactions to all allergens as well as age, sex, and atopy were taken into account simultaneously, revealed that reactions to a dialysed preparation of fodder yeast best distinguished symptomatic farmers from asymptomatic ones. C. utilis and C. albicans may be cross-reactive. The results imply that skin tests alone are of limited value in the search for work-related causes of rhinitis or asthma among dairy farmers. Our study confirms the importance of cow dander as an occupational allergen in dairy farming.

Dermatol., Gentofte Hosp., Hellerup, Denmark","The occurrence of nickel allergy and hand eczema has been investigated in a stratified sample (2500) of the Danish female population by an interview technique. The incidence density (allergy intensity) has been estimated by standard maximum likelihood methods. The age-specific prevalence rates have been calculated by life table techniques. The incidence density has doubled in all age groups from 1948 to 1973. The highest prevalence rate of nickel allergy was found in the 45-year-olds (0.189 ± 0.023). The possible interaction between nickel allergy and hand eczema was analysed by a Markov chain model. Compared with non-nickel-sensitive women, a woman who has become nickel sensitized ran an increased risk of developing hand eczema. And those who had first developed a hand eczema ran an increased risk of subsequently developing nickel allergy. In future efforts to reduce direct skin contact with nickel, the close relation between nickel allergy and hand eczema should be the main argument. Statistical methods based on the incidence density will be useful in the evaluation of these efforts.",,"nickel; contact dermatitis; denmark; dermatitis; diagnosis; drug hypersensitivity; epidemiology; etiology; geographic distribution; hand; hand eczema; nickel hypersensitivity; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Denmark; Dermatitis, Contact; Eczema; Female; Hand Dermatoses; Human; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Middle Age; Nickel; Questionnaires; Sex Factors; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,"nickel, 7440-02-0; Nickel, 7440-02-0",,,,,,,,,"Denmark",,,,,,,,00015555,,ADVEA,"6175135","English","ACTA DERM.-VENEREOL.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020061455

A survey of individual clinical characteristics of these patients indicated that the small group with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) intolerance differed from the rest of the asthmatic population in several respects. Onset of asthma in the former was sudden and later (median 11 years) vs. early (median 2 years) for the rest of the patients. Girls outnumbered boys (M:F ratio 0.8 vs. 2.6); eczema was noted only in one case (4 per cent vs. 46 per cent), and personal as well as family histories for Type I, reagin-mediated allergic reactions, were mostly negative. Nasal polyps were noted in 27 per cent of the ASA reactors but in none of the other patients. On the basis of the observed concurrence, the probability (risk) of ASA reactions, atopic eczema, nasal polyposis, and a heightened familial incidence of asthma were estimated for subsets of asthmatic patients. The complexity inherent in studies of clinical phenomena with variable age of onset is recognized. © 1973.",,"acetylsalicylic acid; adverse drug reaction; age; allergy; angioneurotic edema; asthma; child; drug hypersensitivity; eczema; genetics; hypotension; nose polyp; oral drug administration; prevention; sex; sex difference; sex differentiation; urticaria; Adolescent; Age Factors; Aspirin; Asthma; Child; Chronic Disease; Drug Hypersensitivity; Eczema; Female; Hay Fever; Human; Male; Mass Screening; Questionnaires",,"acetylsalicylic acid, 493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1; Aspirin, 50-78-2","aspirin",,,,,,,"Moestel, Ahmann, Taylor, Schwarton, A comparative evaluation of marketed analgesic drugs (1972) New England Journal of Medicine, 268, pp. 813-815; AMA Council on Drugs, (1971) AMA drug evaluations, pp. 177-188. , American Medical Association, Chicago; Tainter, Ferris, (1969) Aspirin in modern therapy: A review, , Sterling Drugs Inc., New York; Bruce Pearson, Hypersensitivity to aspirin (1963) Salicylates, p. 170. , A.S.
